One Vanderbilt, a new skyscraper in Manhattan, has unveiled a restaurant run by Daniel Boulud, a Michelin-starred chef. Amazon’s second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, will include an amphitheatre for outdoor concerts. In London, 22 Bishopsgate is so dog-friendly that its receptionists issue passes to pets. The recently opened glass tower, which dominates the City of London’s skyline, also houses a climbing wall and a spa.</p><p>As companies try to tempt workers back to the office, developers and investors are betting on new buildings with alluring amenities. But a huge uncertainty hangs over them: will enough people come? Even as vaccinations progress, workers have been slow to return. In early May only one in 20 buildings in America had occupancy levels above 10%, compared with a third in Europe and Africa, and roughly half of buildings in Asia, according to Freespace, a property-tech firm. With the return to work only just beginning, stimulus still in place and long leases yet to expire, the extent of any losses is worryingly hazy.</p><p>Covid-19 has sharpened the demand for newer buildings with better facilities. JPMorgan Chase, a bank, will reduce its overall office space even as it builds the second-tallest skyscraper in Manhattan for its new headquarters. More than half of tours across New York City by prospective tenants are of high-quality “Grade a” offices, compared with 38% before covid-19. This shift is happening alongside another disruption: a tilt towards greener workspaces. Energy efficiency and air-filtration systems are now seen as essential. Asset managers including BlackRock and Brookfield have pledged to get their assets to net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Many property firms are pledging that all new buildings will be net-zero carbon. The shift towards wellness and sustainability is no fad, insists James Goldsmith of axa Investment Managers. “This isn’t a social experiment. We’re asset managers—pension money is at stake.”</p><p>Few in the industry, however, will be drawn on the reckoning they may face. The flight to quality is leaving older buildings looking undesirable just as remote working reduces the total demand for office space. Start with the risk that older buildings become stranded assets. Around half of Hong Kong’s premium stock and nearly two-thirds of commercial property in London were built more than 20 years ago. sl Green, Manhattan’s largest office landlord, says rents at its older properties are down by as much as 10%. Without substantially lower rents or improved ventilation, access to outdoor space or natural light, many will struggle to sell or attract tenants.</p><p>Some dated offices are getting facelifts. Fabrix, a developer, is upgrading a 1960s building in London to include a rooftop forest and a glass-floored infinity pool. Others will be converted into lab and research space, or houses. When aig, an insurer, moves to a recently renovated skyscraper in midtown Manhattan, part of its old headquarters, a tower block built in the 1980s, will be converted into flats. The City of London Corporation, which oversees the Square Mile, plans to turn vacant space into at least 1,500 new homes by 2030.</p><p>Yet none of this can mask the fact that as remote working sticks, demand for office space should fall. Companies are beginning to rethink their property needs, with many downsizing or delaying new leases. Globally, more than 103m square feet of office space has already been vacated since the pandemic began, according to Cushman and Wakefield, a broker. That is 18% more lost floor space than during the financial crisis of 2007-09. Vacancy rates rose steeply over the past year, reaching 18% in the spring in America (see chart 1). The forecasts are gloomy. Roughly one in five offices in America will be empty in 2022, according to Moody’s Analytics, a consultancy. Rents across the country are projected to fall by 7.5% this year; those in San Francisco, by 15%.</p><p>Puzzlingly, the gloom has not yet made its way into conventional measures of prices and credit. Rent-collection rates for properties run by real-estate investment trusts (reits) in North America remained above 90% for most of last year, according to s&amp;p, a rating agency. They may have risen since then. The Economist has examined collection rates for half a dozen of the world’s big listed office landlords: the average stands at 98% for the most recent quarter. Delinquency rates on commercial-mortgage-backed securities linked to shops spiked last summer, and are still high, according to Trepp, a data provider. But those for offices have been unperturbed by the pandemic, at around 2%. The price paid for office space in several big cities has also held up so far (see chart 2).</p><p>A number of obfuscating factors cloud the picture, however. Generous stimulus might have postponed increases in delinquencies and distressed sales. And many firms have not made up their minds yet. No one knows how many workers will stay home, and for how many days of the week. For the most part, investors are avoiding rash transactions: buyers are wary of overpaying, while sellers are unwilling to take a loss in case the crisis turns out to be a blip. The volume of sales has shrunk, making prices a less reliable gauge of health.</p><p>One way to penetrate the uncertainty is to look at more forward-looking measures of valuations. These suggest that office property has been dealt a blow by covid-19. A price index based on appraisals, calculated by Green Street, a research firm, is 9% below its pre-pandemic peak in America. The share prices of reits that invest in offices remain 13% below their level in early 2020 (see chart 3).</p><p>Central banks are on the alert. The reliance of commercial property on debt financing means a downturn could have nasty reverberations across the financial system. Banks’ exposures are sizeable: the stock of loans made to the sector by American banks exceeds $2trn, or about a fifth of their total lending. In its latest Financial Stability Review the European Central Bank warned that subdued activity could be masking deeper trouble, and deemed risks from property to be “elevated”. Many pension funds around the world have loaded up on commercial property in recent years as lower interest rates have forced them to seek returns from less liquid assets.</p><p>The fate of office property could well rest on vacancy rates. If they stay high, then things could start to get hairy. In April the imf reckoned that a lasting increase in the vacancy rate of five percentage points would dent commercial-property valuations by 15% over five years. Fitch, another rating agency, estimates that the value of offices in America could fall by more than half if workers continue to work from home for three days a week. The long-term nature of property leases and the continued availability of debt mean that losses from the pandemic may not materialise for several years. But if the reckoning comes, it will be painful. </p><p><a id="as-oil-demand-picks-up-opec%E2%80%99s-discipline-will-be-tested"></a></p><h1 id="As-oil-demand-picks-up-OPEC’s-discipline-will-be-tested"><a href="#As-oil-demand-picks-up-OPEC’s-discipline-will-be-tested" class="headerlink" title="As oil demand picks up, OPEC’s discipline will be tested"></a>As oil demand picks up, OPEC’s discipline will be tested</h1><p>Recovering demand pushed prices above $70 a barrel for the first time since 2019</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“The demand picture has shown clear signs of improvement.” So declared Abdulaziz bin Salman, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia, at a virtual gathering of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec) on June 1st. The cartel and its allies, chief among them Russia, have been squeezed badly by the covid-induced recession, which cut global demand for oil from nearly 100m barrels a day (bpd) in 2019 to 91m last year. In a frantic effort to prevent a price collapse, opec+, as the group calls itself, agreed to cut output in early 2020. Yet it failed to stop the price dipping below $20 a barrel (see chart).</p><p>Now the cartel believes that oil demand is at last on a firm path to recovery. Ministers agreed to boost supply by roughly 450,000 bpd in July, part of their plan to restore nearly half of the output cuts made last year. Saudi Arabia, which boasts the lowest production costs and the most spare capacity in the cartel, and often acts as a swing producer, indicated it would also soon reverse a unilateral output cut of 1m bpd made earlier this year.</p><p>In response, the price of the benchmark Brent crude shot above $70 a barrel on June 1st for the first time in two years. Several indicators confirm the view that oil demand, a proxy for economic growth, is taking off. Oil inventories, which shot up last year, are falling sharply. The International Energy Agency, an official body, estimates that global oil demand may recover to pre-pandemic levels within a year. In America, demand for petrol surged during the Memorial Day weekend at the end of May, a robust start to its summer “driving season”.</p><p>opec’s celebrations may yet prove premature. One drag on prices could be Iran, where output has been curbed by American sanctions. Speculation that negotiations to revive a deal on Iran’s controversial nuclear programme might soon make progress proved unfounded. The delay means extra Iranian oil is not about to suddenly flood the market. But if a deal is somehow struck this summer, analysts reckon that Iranian exports could rise by 1m bpd or more by the end of the year.</p><p>Furthermore, though tight inventories and high demand push up prices in the near term, those very same prices will tempt America’s shale-oil producers, currently restraining investment, to splash out. Saudi Arabia might also find it harder to keep opec disciplined, observes David Fyfe of Petroleum Argus, an industry journal. Members tend to adhere to agreed cuts when demand is collapsing, but rising prices encourage cheating.</p><p>A bigger worry, says Paul Sheldon of s&amp;p Global Platts, an analytics firm, is “an unexpected demand setback” in 2022. America and China are back to their gas-guzzling ways thanks to the spread of vaccines; Europe is not far behind. But energy demand in India and Latin America, where the pandemic still rages, remains fragile. Mr Fyfe points out that long-haul transportation is another source of weakness.</p><p>The gravest threat to the cartel comes from technological change. There are widely divergent views on how quickly demand for the black stuff will give way to greener fuels, even among oil majors. But purveyors of petroleum will almost certainly find a carbon-constrained world tough going. Edward Morse of Citigroup, a bank, makes a subtler point about innovation. Oil may surge to $80 a barrel in the short term, but that is hardly the start of a “new secular bull run”: as the global cost of finding and developing oil has fallen by over half in the past five years to $10-15 per barrel, he reckons fair value for crude is $40-55. The “clumsy cartel”, as Morris Adelman, an energy economist, once dubbed opec, is in for a rocky ride. </p><p><a id="what-could-break-hong-kong%E2%80%99s-property-market"></a></p><h1 id="What-could-break-Hong-Kong’s-property-market"><a href="#What-could-break-Hong-Kong’s-property-market" class="headerlink" title="What could break Hong Kong’s property market?"></a>What could break Hong Kong’s property market?</h1><p>Protests and a pandemic have barely made a dent</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Planes no longer land in Kai Tak, Hong Kong’s old airport. But nostalgists can stroll along the new “sky garden”, an elevated walkway lined with frangipani, myrtle and acacia, that passes above the old runway. By scanning a qr code along the route, visitors can “augment reality” by superimposing an image of a landing plane on their selfies. The park is part of a redevelopment plan that will eventually yield a hospital, tax office and new homes for tens of thousands of people. On either side of the walkway, cranes, diggers and welders labour busily to augment the reality of Hong Kong’s cramped and pricey housing.</p><p>They have their work cut out for them. Property in Hong Kong remains horribly expensive, despite two years of protests and pandemic. House prices in April were only 1.5% below their peak in 2019. In one tower block being built in Kai Tak, a flat of 889 square feet sold last month for over HK$30m ($3.9m).</p><p>The property market has resisted the pandemic better than it did the sars outbreak of 2003, when prices fell by almost 8%. Indeed, the market has remained tight this time partly because of decisions made back then. When sars struck, house prices had already fallen by more than 60% since 1997. To curtail supply the government resolved to “withdraw from its role of property developer”, vowed not to “sell land at a pathetic price”, and reported with satisfaction that the supply of new flats was dwindling. Hong Kong built nine new towns (now home to almost half of its population of 7.5m) between the 1970s and the early 2000s. It has not finished any since.</p><p>Instead the government has corralled housebuilding into smaller, piecemeal sites, often located in and around existing developments. It is too embarrassed to call them “new towns”, said one speaker at a recent conference hosted by Hong Kong University Business School. It calls them “new development areas” instead.</p><p>With the help of such sites, the government hopes Hong Kong will add 430,000 flats over the next ten years. That, it reckons, would satisfy rising demand. But these targets tend to be over-optimistic: since 2007, housebuilding has undershot them by about 18% in an average year. If the pattern persists, Hong Kong will add only about 350,000 homes in the next decade.</p><p>In this “baseline” scenario, housing is likely to grow dearer still, according to Morgan Stanley. So what would it take to curb property prices? The bank has also put together what it calls a “bear” scenario where prices fall by a fifth or more. For that to happen, Hong Kong would have to add about 730,000 homes over the next ten years, the bank calculates, increasing the existing stock by almost 30% (see chart).</p><p>That would require encroaching on fields, sea and sky. Hong Kong would have to build taller, packing more floor space into each site. It would have to speed up the conversion of farmland, which can take 15 or more years. And it would have to add 235,000 homes on land reclaimed from the sea. This would include the government’s controversial plan to add land to eastern Lantau, Hong Kong’s biggest island, home to 172,000 people as well as white-bellied eagles, Bogadek’s burrowing lizards and finless porpoises, which conservationists argue could be threatened by the initiative.</p><p>Although it would take years for these efforts to reach fruition, a credible plan could change sentiment—and prices—immediately, points out Praveen Choudhary of Morgan Stanley. In the bear scenario house prices fall by 20% by the end of 2022. The downward turn would, in other words, resemble one of the abrupt landings in Kai Tak that used to make arriving in Hong Kong so thrilling. </p><p><a id="the-chinese-state-is-pumping-funds-into-private-equity"></a></p><h1 id="The-Chinese-state-is-pumping-funds-into-private-equity"><a href="#The-Chinese-state-is-pumping-funds-into-private-equity" class="headerlink" title="The Chinese state is pumping funds into private equity"></a>The Chinese state is pumping funds into private equity</h1><p>It sounds too good to be true to private investors—and it might be</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>State cash is burning a hole in the pocket of Shenzhen’s Communist Party secretary. Wang Weizhong told angel investors late last year that if they set up a fund in the south China tech hub, the government would bear 40% of their losses. For the monstrous 400bn-yuan ($62bn) state fund backing such activity, an investment of 3m yuan—the size of a typical angel investment—is a rounding error. For private investors the invitation sounds too good to be true. It might be.</p><p>After several years of loose monetary conditions and bumper dealmaking, liquidity in private equity (pe) in China began to dry up in 2018. New regulations made it harder for banks and insurers to invest. So-called “government-guided” funds set up by local governments or national ministries, by contrast, thrived. Local authorities were encouraged to launch such investment vehicles to lure startups to their cities, along with talent, technology and, eventually, tax revenues. Owing to a lack of in-house investment talent, most of them have acted as limited partners (lps) in private-sector funds.</p><p>More than 1,000 government-guided funds have cropped up across China since 2015. By late 2020 they managed some 9.4trn yuan, according to China Venture, a research firm. A national fund focused on upgrading manufacturing technology held 147bn yuan at the last count. One specialising in microchips exceeded 200bn yuan in 2019. Almost every city of note across China operates its own fund. A municipal fund in Shenzhen says it has more than 400bn yuan in assets under management, making it the largest city-level manager of its kind. In the northern city of Tianjin, the Haihe River Industry Fund is putting to work 100bn yuan along with another 400bn yuan from other investors.</p><p>As a result, pe in China is now flush with state financing. In 2015 private-sector money made up at least 70% of limited-partner funds pouring into the industry. By the end of 2019, state-backed funds accounted for at least that much. Their dominance has only increased since then; by some counts they hold more than 90% of the money in Chinese funds of funds (ie, those that invest in other funds). According to Chinese media, learning to deal with government funds is now a “required course” for pe managers.</p><p>A degree of state influence is now unavoidable. But whether that is beneficial or not is hotly contested. Some investors and advisers say taking government cash can help align private and public interests. “Government lps can open doors for you,” says Kiki Yang of Bain, a consulting firm. State fund managers often understand local policy objectives and can steer investors in the right direction, says a venture-capital investor. The influence can go too far, however: Shenzhen Capital, a huge state fund, posted pictures on its website of a meeting it held in December where it helped each of the 42 companies it had invested in to launch a Communist Party committee. These are seen as a way to imbue private companies with party ideology.</p><p>There are other drawbacks, too. Government funds are “squeezing out other lps”, says one of China’s top venture-capital investors. Clear mismatches in interests have also surfaced. Members of China’s pe elite cut their teeth at global investment groups such as kkr and tpg, two American firms. Their main aim is to produce hefty returns for lps. Not so for government-guided funds. “Rarely do you have a guided fund that is chasing returns,” says an adviser to several of them. Instead, state investors are mainly trying to engineer a windfall in local tax revenues by attracting new companies, especially tech groups. Balancing these interests can lead to tensions, says one China-based investor, and often results in investments that hinge on whether or not a company is willing to move to a specific city. Some even fear such problems could gradually lower overall returns for private-sector investors.</p><p>So far, though, the arrangement has worked well for many private funds. With smaller funds dying off over the past few years—either owing to lack of capital or huge losses—competition for target assets has eased a little. The market is healthier, investors say, as private and state capital is channelled to better fund managers.</p><p>But will it last? One lingering concern for some pe investors is that government funds might dispense with the middlemen, and do more of their own direct investing. Several large government funds have been recruiting from private-sector banks and law firms, bolstering their ability to cut deals, notes a lawyer who works with them. “They are starting to compete with us directly,” says the venture-capital investor. Private investors will appreciate state cash much less when they are vying to outbid it. </p><p><a id="covid%E2%80%99s-unequal-effect-on-companies"></a></p><h1 id="Covid’s-unequal-effect-on-companies"><a href="#Covid’s-unequal-effect-on-companies" class="headerlink" title="Covid’s unequal effect on companies"></a>Covid’s unequal effect on companies</h1><p>The winners and losers, according to the OECD</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In its latest Economic Outlook, the oecd argues that economies are likely to diverge, as some (America and China) recover from the pandemic faster than others (many poor countries). Covid-19 has also struck different sectors differently: tech and pharmaceutical firms prospered; transport and energy firms suffered. Despite such disparities governments’ policies successfully put the economy into “hibernation”: in many places there were fewer bankruptcies in the final quarter of 2020 than in 2019. The trickiness now is in judging when activity is strong enough for support to be withdrawn.</p><p><a id="twilight-of-the-tax-haven"></a></p><h1 id="Twilight-of-the-tax-haven"><a href="#Twilight-of-the-tax-haven" class="headerlink" title="Twilight of the tax haven"></a>Twilight of the tax haven</h1><p>A global corporate-tax pact would ruin a lucrative business model</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As is often the case in multilateral matters, America held the key. When Janet Yellen, its treasury secretary, announced earlier this year that it was time to end the “race to the bottom” on corporate tax, her remarks supercharged sputtering talks over a global deal to overhaul how much tax multinational companies pay, and where.</p><p>Talks are focused on two main changes: reallocating taxing rights towards countries where economic activity takes place, rather than where firms choose to book profits; and setting a minimum global tax rate, likely to be in the region of 15%. Finance ministers from the g7 group of rich countries are set to signal their approval at a meeting on June 4th-5th. The broader g20 could agree terms as soon as July, spurring the other 120 or so countries and territories involved in the talks to fall into line. On May 26th Germany’s finance minister predicted a “revolution” in global tax rules “in just a few weeks”.</p><p>All revolutions have winners and losers. In this case the clearest victors would be large economies where multinationals make lots of sales but book relatively little taxable profit, thanks to tax-planning that siphons income to low-tax jurisdictions. This mismatch has grown along with the rise of digital giants like Apple and Google, the assets of which are largely intangible. Poor countries where global companies have factories and other operations stand to benefit, too, though not by as much as they think they should. The most obvious losers will be the havens that, starting more than half a century ago, took increasing advantage as globalisation made capital more footloose—offering what they saw as much-needed tax competition, and what many others saw as beggar-thy-neighbour economics.</p><p>A study in 2018 concluded that around 40% of multinationals’ overseas profits are artificially shifted to low-tax countries. One official closely involved in the current talks thinks the deal taking shape could “all but kill the havens”. However, havens come in various shapes and sizes, from taxless Caribbean paradises to merely tax-light hubs in Europe and Asia. Some have more to fear than others.</p><p>Paradise lost<br>Things look bleak for the palm-fringed, zero-tax territories, such as Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands (bvi) and the Cayman Islands. Though they make nothing in corporate-tax revenue, they have, to differing degrees, come to rely on fees from subsidiaries of large companies and a cottage industry of accountants, lawyers and other corporate-service providers that sprouted up locally to serve them. Their revenue is mere crumbs compared to the taxes saved by those firms, but a lot for such small economies. Corporate and financial services accounted for over 60% of the bvi’s government revenue in 2018.</p><p>The type of deal that the Biden administration is pushing—which would apply the global minimum rate on a country-by-country basis, rather than in aggregate—would blow up these havens’ business model. They are livid, but there is nothing they can do. A diplomat says they are in the process of being “neutralised”, and are “irrelevant” to the talks. “No one wants to hear from them.” Some at least have other revenue streams: Cayman is a big domicile for hedge funds, Bermuda for insurers.</p><p>Better-connected economies that have traditionally been friendly to corporate-tax-planners are less easy to dismiss. Several European Union countries, such as Ireland and Cyprus, have lured investment with a low corporate-income-tax rate (both levy 12.5%), or, as Luxembourg and the Netherlands have done, with rules that make them attractive conduits in tax structures, helping companies avoid tax in other countries. An imf study in 2019 found that such “phantom” investment had pushed Luxembourg’s stock of foreign-direct investment to $4trn, an improbable one-tenth of the global total. Hong Kong and Singapore have also benefited as corporate-tax entrepots.</p><p>Some of the more egregious loopholes fuelling these flows have been closed in recent years, following an oecd-brokered deal in 2015. Among them is the Double Irish, which funnels profits to subsidiaries registered in Ireland but tax-domiciled in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, and which may have saved Google alone tens of billions of dollars over a decade.</p><p>There is still plenty to lose, though. Ireland is particularly nervous, having come to rely on its 12.5% rate to attract foreign investment, much of it involving real people, offices and factories. Corporate tax now accounts for a record 20% of the country’s total tax take. The Irish have been lobbying America, the source of much of their investment, against a radical reallocation of taxing rights and a minimum tax above 12.5%. Ireland’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, has argued that smaller countries should be allowed to use tax policy to make up for the advantages of scale, location and resources that big ones enjoy.</p><p>Even a minimum rate of 12.5%, or only just above it, could cost Ireland, though, when you factor in tax breaks. Many big companies using it pay an effective rate in the single digits. The country’s “patent box”, a scheme for profits from innovation, charges just 6.25%. A firm paying that might quickly tire of Irish charms if faced with a six-percentage-point top-up. The government has pencilled in an annual tax-revenue loss from the putative global deal of €2bn ($2.5bn)—around 2.4% of public revenue, and the equivalent on a gdp basis to America losing nearly $140bn.</p><p>Ireland has some friends in the eu. Hungary, with a rate of 9%, is a noisy champion of tax competition. Cyprus and Malta are sympathetic, too, though “happy to sit in Ireland’s shadow”, says another official. Outside the eu, Singapore and Switzerland have signalled that they consider 15% too high. The Asian hub would be happier with 10%.</p><p>Luxembourg and the Netherlands, however, have undergone Damascene conversions. The Grand Duchy, lambasted after a leak in 2014 exposed sweetheart tax deals with dozens of multinationals, has passed reforms that narrow tax-arbitrage opportunities and increase tax-ruling transparency. It says it could live with any deal that levels the playing field. The Dutch government, stung by public criticism of its tolerance of tax tricks, has also been trying to close loopholes. “We won’t be the ones who obstruct the deal,” says Hans Vijlbrief, the Dutch state secretary for finance. “My goal is to not be mentioned any more in the list of tax paradises.”</p><p>That leaves Ireland and other eu malcontents in a bind. They could in theory wield vetoes, since the bloc’s tax decisions require unanimity. But that looks highly unlikely given the support for change from the union’s big members and America—not to mention the awful politics of blocking a deal seen by the public as necessary to force big business to pay its fair share.</p><p>Moreover, America and others could impose minimum taxes on their own companies even without a global deal; indeed, America already has a version for intangible income, albeit set at just 10.5%. The revolution is coming, barring an unexpected breakdown in talks. And with it, a golden era for the world’s tax havens may be drawing to a close. </p><p><a id="will-poorer-countries-benefit-from-international-tax-reform"></a></p><h1 id="Will-poorer-countries-benefit-from-international-tax-reform"><a href="#Will-poorer-countries-benefit-from-international-tax-reform" class="headerlink" title="Will poorer countries benefit from international tax reform?"></a>Will poorer countries benefit from international tax reform?</h1><p>Yes, but not by as much as they want</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>International tax reform pits tax-hungry governments against giant multinational companies and their armies of tax advisers. It sets high-tax jurisdictions against low-tax havens. And it requires rich- and poor-country governments to somehow reach agreement. The 139 countries haggling at a forum run by the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, have yet to reach a consensus. Poorer countries worry that the proposals on the table discussed are too complicated, inflexible and unfair.</p><p>Developing countries are thirsty for revenue in general, and reliant on corporate tax in particular. In 2017 African countries raised 19% of their overall revenue from corporation tax, compared with an average of just 9% for oecd members. That is partly because large informal sectors mean that they raise less in, say, personal-income tax.</p><p>The current system for global tax dings poor countries in two ways. For a start, multinational companies shift their reported profits to low-tax havens, depriving them of revenue. Then the rules allocate taxing rights to countries that are home to company headquarters, which tend to be rich. Poor countries’ tax revenues are depressed by as much as 5% relative to an alternative system in which profits are taxed based on the current location of companies’ revenues, their employees and their wage bills, according to an estimate by Petr Jansky of Charles University and Javier Garcia-Bernardo of the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group. By contrast, those in rich countries are only 1% lower.</p><p>The reforms being discussed, and supported by America’s Biden administration, would reallocate the right to tax a slice of some companies’ profits, and agree on a global minimum corporate-tax rate, perhaps of 15%. Poor countries want to crack down on tax avoidance as much as rich ones. But a lack of cash and personnel makes it harder for them to engage in negotiations. Though low-income countries represent 22% of negotiating members, they make up only 5% of those attending important working-party meetings. Those constraints apply to the ability to administer tax and police evasion, too. On May 12th the African Tax Administration Forum (ataf), a group of national agencies, criticised the idea of reallocating the right to tax the portion of multinationals’ profits above some “routine” level, as “far too complex”, suggesting that a share of total profits be reallocated instead.</p><p>Another worry is that the new deal will become a straitjacket. The Biden administration has proposed a “binding, non-optional” dispute-resolution process as a way of reassuring anxious companies that they will not be taxed several times over. But some poor countries fear being on the wrong end of rulings too often, and see broadly applied binding arbitration as a “red line”. (A process applying to a narrower set of disputes could fly, however.) Another concern is that a minimum tax could threaten poorer countries’ use of tax incentives to reel in investment. But a minimum rate of 15% is still well below most poor countries’ statutory tax rate, leaving room for enticement. A global floor might encourage some countries to go the other way, by emboldening them to raise taxes on profits that are reported at home.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest complaint is that rich countries may get the bulk of taxable profits being grabbed back from havens, while poor ones are left with the scraps. In October the oecd estimated that a reallocation of taxing rights on some companies might help raise corporate-tax revenues in poor countries by around 1% (a newer proposal from the Biden administration should yield a similar sum). One negotiator for an African country called that a “disaster for developing countries”. ataf suggested that more companies be included, by drastically lowering the revenue threshold from €20bn ($24bn) to €250m. It is hard to imagine rich countries agreeing to that. The complex knock-on effects of a proposed minimum tax of 15% could raise poor countries’ corporate-tax take by another 2-4%. Even so, rich countries will probably make bigger gains still. </p><p><a id="what-are-the-limits-to-government-borrowing"></a></p><h1 id="What-are-the-limits-to-government-borrowing"><a href="#What-are-the-limits-to-government-borrowing" class="headerlink" title="What are the limits to government borrowing?"></a>What are the limits to government borrowing?</h1><p>New research explores governments’ “Goldilocks” zone</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The scale of Joe Biden’s plans is hard to exaggerate. Where the American president’s former boss, Barack Obama, pivoted quickly to deficit-cutting after the trials of the global financial crisis, Mr Biden’s first budget, which he unveiled on May 28th, will borrow unapologetically. The plans assume that annual fiscal deficits will exceed 4% of gdp through to the end of the decade; net public debt will rise to 117% of gdp in 2030 from 110% today. The largesse raises two big questions. One is whether, coming on top of past stimulus packages, it will contribute to an overheating of America’s economy in the short term. The other important question is whether in the longer term America can prudently afford to loosen the purse-strings for a sustained period. As crisis has hit and interest rates have fallen, politicians have felt more able to run up debts than in the past. But the issue of whether and when limits to borrowing might apply still remains. Recent research casts light on these constraints.</p><p>In a new working paper, Atif Mian of Princeton University, Ludwig Straub of Harvard University and Amir Sufi of the University of Chicago attempt to gauge governments’ room to run. Their analysis (which does not incorporate the effects of the pandemic) builds on recent work that estimates how the “convenience yield” on government bonds—or the amount by which a bond’s yield is reduced because of the safety and liquidity benefits it offers investors—varies with the size of the debt burden. Other things equal, the greater the volume of outstanding bonds, the higher the return investors demand. Work by Arvind Krishnamurthy of Stanford and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen of the University of California, Berkeley, suggests, for example, that a 10% increase in the ratio of debt to gdp pushes government-bond yields up by 0.13-0.17 percentage points. (In practice, of course, other things are not always equal: the long-run effect of increased bond supply on safety and liquidity premia may be offset by other factors, such as a short-run surge in demand for safe assets prompted by financial instability, leading to falling bond yields amid rising debt loads.)</p><p>Because the supply of bonds matters, Mr Mian and co-authors write, a level of government debt that is too low can result in an interest rate that slinks towards zero. But rates cannot fall much further below zero; the result is narrower scope for central banks to stimulate activity, and therefore lower economic growth and higher unemployment. The problems of debt sustainability are often associated with high debt levels, which push the interest rate above the economic-growth rate. When that condition is met, the debt burden grows steadily even in the absence of new borrowing. But the authors raise the theoretical possibility of another source of fiscal-sustainability problems: when too low a level of debt leads to serious deflation, dragging the growth rate into negative territory and below the interest rate.</p><p>In between those two extremes, the researchers argue, lies a “Goldilocks zone” in which a fiscal free lunch is possible. They flesh out a point highlighted in 2019 by Olivier Blanchard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics: that when the interest rate on public debt is below the economy’s growth rate, existing debt burdens have essentially no fiscal cost. In such cases, existing debt will decline as a share of output even if no new taxes are levied—though a government that continues to run deficits may nonetheless add to its debt pile. Assuming a balanced budget and based on estimates of the convenience yield on Treasuries, the authors reckon that America’s Goldilocks zone—the maximum level of debt you could reach and then stabilise without raising taxes—could extend up to about 260% of gdp. (The uncertainty around their estimates means the limit could lie between 230% and 300% of gdp.)</p><p>There is also a range of indebtedness across which governments may run deficits in perpetuity without increasing the debt burden. America, they estimate, could run a deficit of 2.1% of gdp for ever so long as its debt is below 130% of gdp (after which threshold the largest deficit that could be run in sustained fashion without raising the debt burden drops steadily towards zero).</p><p>This logic suggests that though supersized deficits may be appropriate now, America cannot run them for ever. Doing so would cause debt to rise, potentially out of the Goldilocks zone and into riskier territory. And the longer America waits to shrink its deficit to the maximum sustainable level, the closer to surplus (or the further into surplus) that level will be. Mr Biden may take some comfort from the fact that his borrowing is manageable for now. Even so, it could eventually limit America’s fiscal freedom.</p><p>Bonds away<br>Importantly, a Goldilocks window is not fixed. Slower economic growth could shrink the safe zone by narrowing the gap between growth and interest rates—unless, that is, an economic slowdown also causes a sharp drop in interest rates, pushing them closer to zero and necessitating fiscal stimulus. Rising inequality may lead to calls for redistribution, but because the rich tend to buy government bonds in disproportionate numbers, levelling the income distribution may reduce the scope for a fiscal free lunch. That also means, the authors note, that efforts to address wide deficits through progressive taxes may not bear much fruit: taxes on high earners will hoover up money that might be used to buy bonds.</p><p>Analyses such as these are trying to understand circumstances outside of historical experience, and necessarily come with large uncertainties and assumptions attached. Budget-setting politicians too have uncertainties to navigate, and must do so carefully. Government borrowing plays a starring role in today’s macroeconomic zeitgeist. A balance of sorts is still required, between making good use of the government’s capacity to borrow, and acknowledging that limits to public borrowing are not so distant that they can be ignored altogether. </p><p><a id="science--technology---a-growing-number-of-governments-hope-to-clone-america%E2%80%99s-darpa"></a></p><h1 id="Science-amp-technology-—A-growing-number-of-governments-hope-to-clone-America’s-DARPA"><a href="#Science-amp-technology-—A-growing-number-of-governments-hope-to-clone-America’s-DARPA" class="headerlink" title="(Science &amp; technology)—A growing number of governments hope to clone America’s DARPA"></a>(Science &amp; technology)—A growing number of governments hope to clone America’s DARPA</h1><p>They will not succeed unless they adopt the spirit which motivates it</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Using messenger rna to make vaccines was an unproven idea. But if it worked, the technique would revolutionise medicine, not least by providing protection against infectious diseases and biological weapons. So in 2013 America’s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa) gambled. It awarded a small, new firm called Moderna $25m to develop the idea. Eight years, and more than 175m doses later, Moderna’s covid-19 vaccine sits alongside weather satellites, gps, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which darpa can claim at least partial credit.</p><p>It is the agency that shaped the modern world, and this success has spurred imitators. In America there are arpas for homeland security, intelligence and energy, as well as the original defence one. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $6.5bn to set up a health version, which will, the president vows, “end cancer as we know it”. His administration also has plans for another, to tackle climate change. Germany has recently established two such agencies: one civilian (the Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation, or sprin-d) and another military (the Cybersecurity Innovation Agency). Japan’s interpretation is called Moonshot r&amp;d. In Britain a bill for an Advanced Research and Invention Agency—often referred to as uk arpa—is making its way through Parliament.</p><p>An agency needs agency<br>As governments across the rich world begin, after a four-decade lull, to spend more on research and development, the idea of an agency to invent the future (and, in so doing, generate vast industries) is alluring and, the success of darpa suggests, no mere fantasy. In many countries there is displeasure with the web of bureaucracy that entangles funding systems, and hope that the darpa model can provide a way of getting around it. But as some have discovered, and others soon will, copying darpa requires more than just copying the name. It also needs commitment to the principles which made the original agency so successful—principles that are often uncomfortable for politicians.</p><p>On paper, the approach is straightforward. Take enormous, reckless gambles on things so beneficial that only a handful need work to make the whole venture a success. As Arun Majumdar, founding director of arpa-e, America’s energy agency, puts it: “If every project is succeeding, you’re not trying hard enough.” Current (unclassified) darpa projects include mimicking insects’ nervous systems in order to reduce the computation required for artificial intelligence and working out how to protect soldiers from the enemy’s use of genome-editing technologies.</p><p>The result is a mirror image of normal r&amp;d agencies. Whereas most focus on basic research, darpa builds things. Whereas most use peer review and carefully selected measurements of progress, darpa strips bureaucracy to the bones (the conversation in 1965 which led the agency to give out $1m for the first cross-country computer network, a forerunner to the internet, took just 15 minutes). All work is contracted out. darpa has a boss, a small number of office directors and fewer than 100 programme managers, hired on fixed short-term contracts, who act in a manner akin to venture capitalists, albeit with the aim of generating specific outcomes rather than private returns.</p><p>The first challenge for the new arpas is to secure the breathing space required for such experimentation. sprin-d illustrates how difficult this can be. The concept was approved by Germany’s cabinet—“and then the Federal Court of Auditors came along,” sighs Barbara Diehl, sprin-d’s chief partnership officer. After the auditors issued their recommendations, the agency lost its exemption from standard public-sector procurement rules and pay scales, restricting who it could hire and the sorts of risks it could take. Existing government ministries exert influence through the agency’s board, stymying radicalism, says Ms Diehl. Dominic Cummings, a former aide to Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, who demanded a British agency as a condition of his employment, has said he is concerned by the provisions for ministerial oversight in the legislation creating it.</p><p>Without freedom from political interference, the risk-taking instincts of those at the cutting edge are curbed. The administrative and research directors of Germany’s Cybersecurity Innovation Agency recently quit, frustrated by political interference. In America the homeland-security arpa was established in 2002, but has been hamstrung by power struggles in the department that gave it its name. “It has never been allowed to make independent decisions, it has never been allowed an independent budget,” says an observer. There is a debate about whether the Biden administration’s health arpa (arpa-h) ought to stand alone, or be part of the National Institutes of Health (nih). The latter would be less of a legislative challenge, but may infringe its independence.</p><p>Progress report<br>darpa’s budget in 2020 was $3.6bn, equivalent to just 8% of the nih’s. If all goes to plan, arpa-h will be on a similar scale, but none of the others receives such funding (arpa-e got $425m last year, roughly as much as one of darpa’s six offices). Since the model works by making lots of bets in the hope that a few will come off, stingier funding means fewer wagers, which reduces the chance of success and thus of continued political support. This is especially true given the difficulty of measuring progress. As a paper by Pierre Azoulay of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (mit) and his colleagues notes: “It is impossible to accurately measure the incidence of one-in-a-thousand ideas, much less one-in-a-million ideas, on a timescale relevant to political decision-making.”</p><p>The new agencies must also work out how to get their innovations out of the lab. There is a close relationship between darpa and the Department of Defence, which is a customer for its work. But other agencies lack such a pipeline. Research by Anna Goldstein at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and her colleagues finds that, although new “cleantech” companies sponsored by arpa-e produce more patents than others, they are not more likely to raise venture capital, be acquired by larger firms or list on public markets. So far, at least, the agency’s innovations have struggled to leap into the real world.</p><p>When arpa-e began in 2009 the hope was that venture capitalists would pick up innovations emerging from it. They have proved reluctant. Energy technologies take far longer to reach the market than venture capital’s favourite investment, software. arpa-e has thus tweaked the darpa model to add a “tech-to-market” team, to guide projects through the industrial jungle. Last year it began handing out grants of up to $150,000 to promising previous award-winners seeking to grow. William Bonvillian, a science-policy expert at mit, suspects one missing ingredient is simply time: “We created the internet in ’69. It didn’t scale up until ’91 or ’92. So we’ve just got to get used to it taking a while.”</p><p>arpa-h may face similar difficulties. It is based on the idea that the nih is too conservative, focusing on biology at a time when many life-science breakthroughs happen where biology, chemistry and computer science meet. Mikko Packalen and Jay Bhattacharya, of Waterloo and Stanford universities respectively, provide supportive evidence, finding that the nih’s funding of work building on new advances has declined. arpa-h’s other goal, though, is to pump money into treatments for rare diseases, eschewed by the private sector because of limited moneymaking opportunities. As with arpa-e, this lack of commercial interest may make the transition from innovation to the real world tricky.</p><p>Michael Stebbins, who was an official in Barack Obama’s administration, and is an advocate for arpa-h, hopes that someone from darpa can be recruited to lead the new agency. Replicating darpa’s freewheeling culture is such a challenging task that there have been times when darpa itself has failed. It went through a fallow period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and many feel its ambitions have been trimmed back in recent decades—minimising failures, but also successes.</p><p>The defence focus also has an inbuilt advantage. By failing to build a terrible weapon, American leaders can reassure themselves that their adversaries won’t either. There is no such reassurance in failing to cure cancer. But that has not been enough to dissuade politicians in America, Britain, Germany and Japan. The lesson many have learnt from darpa is that mere difficulty is no reason to avoid something. It may even be a reason to do it. </p><p><a id="composing-by-computer"></a></p><h1 id="Composing-by-computer"><a href="#Composing-by-computer" class="headerlink" title="Composing by computer"></a>Composing by computer</h1><p>Concerts may soon feature music written by artificial intelligence</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>These days, anyone with a computer can be a composer. Sort of. Give a piece of commercial software such as Magenta, developed by Google, the first few notes of a song, and it will make something merrily tuneful out of them. Tuneful, but not sophisticated. At least, that is the view of Gerhard Widmer of Johannes Kepler University, in Linz, Austria.</p><p>In Dr Widmer’s opinion, “what they create may contain certain statistical properties. It’s not dissonant, but it’s not actually music…It would create a piece that would last three days because it has no notion of what it wants to do. It doesn’t know that things need an end, a beginning, and something in-between.” He thinks he can do better. He wants to use artificial intelligence to explore how toying with a listener’s expectations affects the perception of music, and then to employ that knowledge to create software which can produce something more akin to Beethoven than “Baa Baa Black Sheep”. That means giving computers an ability to perceive subtleties they cannot currently detect but might, using the latest techniques, be able to learn. To this end, Dr Widmer is running a project called “Whither music?”—a title borrowed from a lecture series given at Harvard University in 1973 by Leonard Bernstein, a celebrated 20th-century composer.</p><p>When human beings listen to music, they subconsciously predict what the next note will be. One trick composers use is to toy with these expectations—sometimes delivering what is expected and sometimes deliberately taking an unexpected turn. Performers then enhance that emotional manipulation by adding expression—for example, by playing a particular phrase louder or more staccato than the one which came before. One thing Dr Widmer is doing, therefore, is teaching computers to copy them.</p><p>To this end, he and his colleagues have amassed a huge body of recordings captured on specially designed instruments, notably the Bösendorfer 290 se, a type of concert piano made in the 1980s which was rigged by the manufacturers with sensors that measure the force and timings of the pianist’s key-pressing with great accuracy. The jewel of their collection is a set of performances on a 290 se by Nikita Magaloff (pictured), a legendary concert pianist and Chopin expert, of almost all of Chopin’s solo piano work. These were recorded at a series of six concerts which Magaloff gave in Vienna, shortly before his death in 1992.</p><p>The team’s software takes data from these and other, humbler recordings and compares them with the score as written by the composer. It is looking for mismatches between the two—places, for instance, where the performer misses the beat by a few milliseconds or plays a note more forcefully than the score indicates. By analysing thousands of performances and comparing them with digitised versions of the composers’ scores, the software learns what performers are choosing to accentuate when they play, and thus what those performers think is particularly interesting to the audience.</p><p>Other algorithms are being taught the rules of composition. “[Existing software models] take all the past notes that have already been played and predict the next note, which has nothing to do with how a human composer would compose,” Dr Widmer explains. “Composition is a planning process that involves structure. We want to create models that make predictions at several levels simultaneously.” The team are designing and training individual modules for different elements of music: melody, rhythm, harmony and so on—with the intention of combining them into a master program that can be trained on performances and scores in toto.</p><p>Once complete, the resulting megabyte maestro will decide not just which note follows which, but why that should be so and how that note should be played. “Instead of saying, ‘the next note is statistically likely to be a C’, it would say, ‘I believe that the next four bars will feature some kind of IV-I-V harmony [a common type of chord progression in Western music], because we had a similar pattern in a similar melodic context earlier in the piece’.”</p><p>Software of this sort might have applications beyond composition. Existing “recommender” algorithms struggle to generate musical playlists that appeal to particular tastes. A recent paper showed that they are good at suggesting pieces for fans of pop music with catholic appetites, but not for those who prefer a specific genre, such as heavy metal or rap. Software that understands musical expectancy might do a better job. A program which knows what to listen out for might discover that the music of Skepta or Slayer has specific types of musical surprises within it, and, on this basis, be able to recommend new music with similar surprises.</p><p>Whether computer software will ever be able to write music that stands up to comparison with the likes of Chopin or Cream remains to be seen. Dr Widmer remains sceptical, but it is hard to see why. Great art is often a product of knowing when to obey the rules and when to break them. And that is exactly what he is teaching his machines. </p><p><a id="cicadas-insecticides-and-children"></a></p><h1 id="Cicadas-insecticides-and-children"><a href="#Cicadas-insecticides-and-children" class="headerlink" title="Cicadas, insecticides and children"></a>Cicadas, insecticides and children</h1><p>The return of periodical cicadas bodes ill for children’s well-being</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As summer approaches, adults of cicada Brood X, last seen in 2004, have begun emerging in the eastern United States. Their return is welcome news for entomologists who study them, and for adventurous chefs in search of novel ingredients. It could, though, have bad consequences for unborn infants and young children in the places where they live.</p><p>The cicadas themselves are harmless to people, but their nymphs feed on the roots of woody plants such as apple trees. Farmers, understandably peeved by their uninvited guests, respond by spraying those trees with large quantities of pesticides to stop the adults mating. This chemical warfare successfully curbs the insects, but, according to new working paper by Charles Taylor of Columbia University, it may also have adverse consequences for children.</p><p>Mr Taylor, who studies environmental and health economics, started his investigation by collecting, on a county-by-county basis, data stretching back from 2016 to 1950 for the parts of America where periodical cicadas live. There are, altogether, 15 such broods; 12 of them emerge as adults every 17 years (of which Brood X is the largest) and three every 13 years, in a phenomenon known as predator swamping. Lacking good information on pesticide use, Mr Taylor used the abundance of apple trees in a county as a proxy for how much of the stuff farmers were likely to deploy in a brood year. He also studied local health and education records for brood years and non-brood years. The results are disturbing.</p><p>Mr Taylor’s analysis found that in the year immediately after the emergence of periodical cicadas, infant-mortality rates would increase by 0.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in counties which have lots of apple trees (see chart). That represents a 5% increase over America’s national rate of six deaths per 1,000 births. No such change was seen in non-apple-growing counties.</p><p>Cicada-driven pesticide spikes seem to harm cognitive development, too. Primary-school pupils (those aged roughly eight to ten) who lived in counties which saw emergences of periodical cicadas while those children were in their mothers’ wombs later fared worse than others on standardised exams. Mr Taylor estimates that these pupils, in effect, lose around 10% of a grade-year’s-worth of learning. The study finds, too, that high-school pupils are around 5% more likely to drop out of school in their 12th grade (ie, at the age of 17-18) if they live in a county that was affected by a cicada event 19 years earlier, when they were in utero. That suggests pesticide use does indeed hurt long-term cognitive development.</p><p>Mr Taylor’s study focuses on the use of pesticides on a single crop, apples, against a single foe, cicadas. If his results are accurate, they suggest that quite modest exposure to pesticides can have a serious effect on unborn infants—for even in counties where apples are an important crop, orchards cover only a small fraction of the land, meaning that tree-spraying is not dumping huge amounts of pesticides into the environment. What that implies for the effects of other, more extensive pesticide uses would certainly bear investigation. </p><p><a id="testing-alibis-is-not-as-straightforward-as-it-seems"></a></p><h1 id="Testing-alibis-is-not-as-straightforward-as-it-seems"><a href="#Testing-alibis-is-not-as-straightforward-as-it-seems" class="headerlink" title="Testing alibis is not as straightforward as it seems"></a>Testing alibis is not as straightforward as it seems</h1><p>Justice is sometimes badly served as a consequence</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 1985 ronald cotton, a resident of North Carolina, was falsely convicted of rape and burglary, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Nearly a decade later, he was exonerated on the basis of dna evidence. Not only did the victim make an error in identifying him as the perpetrator, but Mr Cotton had also provided an alibi that could not be corroborated.</p><p>This, it turned out, was because he was wrong about where he had been when the crime was committed. A subsequent investigation showed that he had, in error, instead told the police where he was at that time on the same day during the week before. An unfortunate confusion, then, with serious consequences. But, if research just published in Psychological Science is to be believed, one that might be commoner than imagined.</p><p>Aware of Mr Cotton’s case, and of estimates that about 1% of America’s prison population are innocent of the offences they are serving time for, Yim Hyungwook of Hanyang University, in South Korea, and Simon Dennis of the University of Melbourne, in Australia, wanted to understand better how people remember details about where they were when in the past. They hoped they would thus be able to identify common mistakes that people make about such matters, so that they could bring these to the attention of detectives and defence lawyers, and therefore help keep innocent people out of jail.</p><p>To this end, they recruited 51 volunteers and asked them to download an app onto their smartphones, to collect information about their lives over the course of four weeks. The app tracked the phone’s location using gps, and made recordings, from time to time, of nearby sounds.</p><p>A week after the experiment ended, participants were asked to take a memory test. They were presented with electronic maps that had four markers on them, and were asked 72 questions of the form, “click the marker where you were on Thursday morning 8am on August 15th”. They were allowed to zoom into the maps and take a look at the names of streets and venues in the area, but were not allowed to use the “street view” facility or to refer to any other information, such as past appointments noted on the calendar of their phone. After selecting a marker, they were asked to rate how confident of their answer they were, on a scale that ranged from one (not at all confident) to five (very confident).</p><p>Dr Yim and Dr Dennis found that participants got things wrong about a third of the time, and further examination of the data revealed that these errors were not random. People were more likely to remember events incorrectly if they were similar in time or space than they were if they were not. Specifically, they chose the right day of the week but the wrong week 19% of the time, and the right hour of the day but the wrong day 8% of the time.</p><p>Analysis of the audio files revealed that they were also more likely to make errors when two locations had similar acoustic environments. And when participants were confident of their answer, they were almost always right, and when they were not at all confident, they were much more likely to be wrong.</p><p>None of these findings is, it is true, that surprising. But they are, nevertheless, novel—and are the sorts of things that detectives and lawyers need to be aware of. How common it is for mistaken imprisonment, or worse, to happen as it did to Mr Cotton on the basis of alibi claims that could not be proved because they were themselves mistakes, is unknown. But that is because, until now, no one has had reason to ask. </p><p><a id="the-origin-of-watermelons"></a></p><h1 id="The-origin-of-watermelons"><a href="#The-origin-of-watermelons" class="headerlink" title="The origin of watermelons"></a>The origin of watermelons</h1><p>A popular fruit started off in Darfur</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The origins of some crops are well known.

Some crops’ beginnings, though, are lost in the mists of time—among them those of the watermelon.</p><p>That watermelons’ ancestors are African has long been clear. Archaeological evidence from Libya and Egypt suggests they were cultivated there thousands of years ago, and the continent is home to seven species and numerous subspecies of plants classified in the same genus, Citrullus, as the cultivated crop. But only now has a likely candidate been nailed down. An examination of available genetic data about members of Citrullus, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Susanne Renner of Washington University, in St Louis, and Guillaume Chomicki of the University of Sheffield, in Britain, has led them to conclude that watermelons were domesticated from a subspecies called the Sudanese Kordofan melon, which grows in Darfur, the western part of Sudan.</p><p>Tellingly, this is one of the few wild members of Citrullus that is bland, rather than excruciatingly bitter to the human palate. That ties in with a reinterpretation by the two researchers of a 4,450-year-old Egyptian tomb painting (pictured). The previous assumption had been that early cultivated watermelons were too bitter to eat raw, and would thus need to be cooked and sweetened for consumption. This painting, though, shows what appears to be a stripped watermelon being served raw at a table decorated by lotus flowers.</p><p><a id="books--arts---a-new-exhibition-illuminates-the-history-of-dutch-slavery"></a></p><h1 id="Books-amp-arts-—A-new-exhibition-illuminates-the-history-of-Dutch-slavery"><a href="#Books-amp-arts-—A-new-exhibition-illuminates-the-history-of-Dutch-slavery" class="headerlink" title="(Books &amp; arts)—A new exhibition illuminates the history of Dutch slavery"></a>(Books &amp; arts)—A new exhibition illuminates the history of Dutch slavery</h1><p>Once among the world’s leading slavers, the Dutch have long sought to play down this part of their colonial past</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 1881 someone donated an antique brass circlet to the Rijksmuseum, the Dutch national museum of art and history. The object (pictured) is a bit of a stumper. Engraved with a heraldic shield and the year 1689, it bears no indication of what purpose it served. The museum staff listed it as a dog collar.</p><p>They could have investigated more thoroughly. Scattered through the Rijksmuseum’s collection are paintings showing similar collars worn not by dogs, but by young black men. Referred to as “Moors”, they were routinely kept as servants in wealthy 17th-century Dutch households, a sideline of the vast European human-trafficking operation that carried millions of enslaved Africans to the Americas.</p><p>Slavery was not a distant memory in 1881. On some Dutch colonial plantations it had ended just a decade earlier. Yet a curator at the Rijksmuseum apparently failed to make the connection. Had Dutch society really forgotten such objects? Or was it trying not to see them?</p><p>The collar is on display in the museum’s new exhibition on the history of enslavement in the Netherlands and its former colonies. (King Willem-Alexander opened the exhibition in May, but the museum remains closed until June 5th due to covid-19 restrictions.) It is part of a broad movement to re-examine the country’s colonial past. The Netherlands ruled Indonesia, Suriname, Curaçao and several other Caribbean islands from the 1600s until the mid-20th century, first through its East India and West India Companies (the voc and gwc) and later directly. Slaves laboured on coffee, spice and sugar plantations through to the 1860s. During their Golden Age of painters and tulips, the Dutch were among the world’s leading slavers, conquering forts in west Africa to seize the trade from the Portuguese.</p><p>In modern times the Dutch have played down this history. But that has become harder as the Netherlands has grown more multicultural. The biggest Dutch immigrant communities come from Morocco and Turkey, but those from Suriname, the Caribbean and Indonesia make up about 5% of the population. Arguments over “Zwarte Piet” (a blackface tradition associated with the St Nicholas Day holiday) and Black Lives Matter have riven Dutch politics. For the Rijksmuseum, bringing the other side of the colonial past into view is a condition for staying relevant.</p><p>One challenge in staging an exhibition on slavery is a lack of physical material. “Enslaved people were not allowed to own objects, they were not allowed to write, they were hardly ever depicted,” says Valika Smeulders, the Rijksmuseum’s chief historian, who hails from Curaçao. The museum redresses this by uncovering traces in its collection that had gone unnoticed. In Bartholomeus van der Helst’s painting of an Amsterdam shooting company from 1639, an unidentified black youth stands at the centre. Rembrandt’s opulent portraits of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit are well known; less so is that their wealth came in part from the slave-driven sugar trade.</p><p>A second technique is to examine everyday objects from the slave economy, such as plantation bells. For slaves they could be a relief or an omen, signalling the end of the day and the weighing of the harvest, which might presage a beating if the quota was not met. The logo of the gwc, a nostalgic sight on old canal houses in Dutch cities, takes on a different aura once you have seen it on a branding iron used on humans. Other objects testify to the perseverance of enslaved people: a botanist’s samples from Suriname in 1687 include sesame and okra, African crops that must have been planted by captives. Oral history adds another layer. Songs from Suriname, Curaçao and South Africa (originally a Dutch colony) sound like lullabies, until you hear the translations. Shon ta bende nos, mama, katibu ta galina: “The landlord sells us, mama, slaves are chickens.”</p><p>The exhibition is structured around the stories of ten individuals, five connected to the functioning of the slave system and five embodying resistance against it. The direct testimony of Wally, a slave in Suriname, exists because he was interrogated in court. He and four others were gruesomely executed in 1707 after they ran off into the jungle in protest at tough new work rules. Works by Dirk Valkenburg, a painter dispatched by the absentee owner in Amsterdam to record his plantation, provide visual context. Valkenburg’s depiction of what looks like a holiday celebration is magnificent: the revellers leap from the canvas, individual and compelling. It is all the more shocking to read that this seemingly empathetic painter had condemned Wally, calling him a “troublemaker”.</p><p>Some of the history in the exhibition is path-breaking. The Dutch tend to identify slavery with the Americas, but another huge branch of the trade shipped captives from the Ganges delta to Indonesia, whence they might be sold on to South Africa or occasionally the Netherlands itself. The attention to enslaved Africans and Asians in Holland is new, too. Slavery was illegal in the Dutch homeland, but slaves brought there remained in servitude, perhaps because they had few options.</p><p>Some found their way into Dutch society nonetheless. One was Paulus Maurus, a servant of the wealthy Nassau La Lecq clan, an offshoot of the Dutch royal family. Church records show that he became a cavalry drummer in the regiment of the Netherlands’ top commander, and that he married a Dutch woman in 1684 and had a child. A painting of Dutch cavalry decades later shows just such a mounted black drummer, wearing what seems to be a metal collar. Indeed, the engraved shield on the brass collar from 1689 seems to belong to the house of Nassau La Lecq. The case is circumstantial, but it may have been Maurus who wore it.</p><p>What drove this system was money. The exhibition could do with a bit more economics, but it makes clear that the financial incentives were immense. In 1621 Jan Pieterszoon Coen, an officer of the voc, massacred 14,000 of the 15,000 inhabitants of the Moluccan island of Great Banda, at the time the world’s chief source of nutmeg, and replaced them with imported slaves. He did so to secure a monopoly on a spice that sold for hundreds of times as much in Europe as in South-East Asia.</p><p>All this is grim, but it is also riveting. That makes the relative unfamiliarity of the history of slavery, a central aspect of European colonialism, even harder to explain. Many Europeans feel that slavery gets too much attention, that it took place long ago and has nothing to do with them. The resentment gives away the game. In the colonial age, the voices of slaves were silenced because hearing them might upend the socioeconomic system. Later, they were silenced because hearing them makes the heirs of that system feel guilty. Yet as psychotherapists know, the truth is more interesting than the silences and fables under which it is concealed. </p><p><a id="humans-are-imperfect-inconsistent-decision-makers"></a></p><h1 id="Humans-are-imperfect-inconsistent-decision-makers"><a href="#Humans-are-imperfect-inconsistent-decision-makers" class="headerlink" title="Humans are imperfect, inconsistent decision-makers"></a>Humans are imperfect, inconsistent decision-makers</h1><p>In their new book, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein offer strategies for improvement</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Noise. By Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein. Little, Brown; 464 pages; $32. William Collins; £25</p><p>Noise is unwanted variation in judgments that should be identical, which leads to inaccurate and unfair decisions. It is all around people all the time, though individuals fail to notice it. To get a sense of how it happens, perform a “noise audit” right now: open your phone’s stopwatch app and practice counting ten seconds. Now, with your eyes closed, count several times, hitting the lap button each time you believe ten seconds have elapsed.</p><p>Your answers weren’t perfect but noisy: slightly above or below the ten-second mark. And if they were consistently wrong in one direction, then there is bias too, which is a different form of error (you counted too quickly or slowly).</p><p>The problem of bias in decisions is well known and there are strategies that people can adopt to minimise it. For example, customers may be “anchored” on the first price they are presented with in a transaction, so they learn to consciously discard it before they negotiate. But noise is different precisely because it is less apparent. “It becomes visible only when we think statistically about an ensemble of similar judgments. Indeed, it then becomes hard to miss,” Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein write in their new book.</p><p>The divergences are stark. In a courthouse in Miami, one judge would grant refugees asylum in 88% of cases while another would do so 5% of the time. A large study of radiologists found that the false-positive rate ranged from 1% to 64%, meaning that two-thirds of the time, a radiologist said a mammogram showed cancer when it was not cancerous. Doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids at the end of a long day. Judges made harsher decisions leading up to their breaks and on hotter days. An insurance firm’s underwriters assessed premiums that varied by 55%, a difference that was five times greater than its management had imagined.</p><p>Not only do individuals differ with their peers, they often fail to agree with themselves. Wine experts tasting the same samples for a second time scored fewer than one in five identically. Four out of five fingerprint examiners altered their original identification decision when presented with contextual information that should not have been a factor in matching prints. In one medical study, assessing angiograms, physicians disagreed with their earlier judgments more than half the time.</p><p>Noise is sometimes good. When different investors size up a trade or book reviewers reach different assessments, the diversity of opinion is beneficial. But more commonly it creates problems. In law noise means unfairness. In business it can be costly.</p><p>Yet it can be reduced. The authors’ remedies include a “noise audit” to measure the degree of disagreement on the same cases, to quantify the variation that is usually invisible. They also call for better “decision hygiene” such as designating an observer for group decisions, to prevent common biases and noisy judgments. For example, they can ensure that participants in a team reach independent assessments before coming together as a group to aggregate their decisions.</p><p>Another solution is to dispense with people altogether. Statistical models, pre-determined rules and algorithms in many cases are more accurate than human judgment. The authors welcome artificial intelligence to make many decisions in society, but acknowledge that people are predisposed to resisting their answers, for lack of the personal, emotional quality in decision-making—even if it leads to inferior, or at least variable, decisions.</p><p>The trio speaks with credibility. Mr Kahneman is a Nobel laureate whose ideas on bias in human reasoning have reshaped economics and society; Mr Sunstein is a polymath scholar at Harvard and occasional government official putting his ideas into policy; Mr Sibony is a former McKinsey partner who teaches decision science at a French business school. Yet despite the book’s title, the authors struggled to extract the signal from the noise, so to speak, needing some 400 pages to make their case. A tighter argument would have enhanced the ideas they present. </p><p><a id="google-will-nudge-users-to-adopt-gender-neutral-language"></a></p><h1 id="Google-will-nudge-users-to-adopt-gender-neutral-language"><a href="#Google-will-nudge-users-to-adopt-gender-neutral-language" class="headerlink" title="Google will nudge users to adopt gender-neutral language"></a>Google will nudge users to adopt gender-neutral language</h1><p>The tech company intervenes in the argument about masculine generics</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In the 1990s parodies of Clippy from Microsoft Word were a bit of a trend in cartoons and magazines. The annoying paper-clip-shaped figure would pop up as soon as you began writing “Dear…” and say: “It looks like you’re writing a letter,” before offering unsolicited advice on things such as formatting.</p><p>Two decades later, various automatic aids to writing, including spelling and grammar-checkers, are much better. They are both more discerning—powered by artificial intelligence rather than manually programmed—and more subtle in their operations. Many writers are grateful for their interventions.</p><p>But now tech companies are wading into trickier waters. In 2020 Google’s internal style guide was updated, encouraging developers to eschew “unnecessarily gendered language” in their documentation. Rather than referring to “man hours”, for example, a coder might discuss the “person hours” involved in a project. “All of mankind” could be replaced with “all of humanity”, the guide’s authors suggested.</p><p>On May 18th the company announced that it was going further in its promotion of inclusive language. Google Docs, its popular free word-processing software, would soon be nudging people away from potentially sexist language, such as the generic use of “chairman”. Instead it will offer gender-neutral suggestions including “chairperson”.</p><p>The tech company is right to see a problem. Though it doesn’t fit in the same category as spelling errors or grammatical quandaries, sexist bias is shot through the English language, as well as others. Consider the lack of female equivalent for “master” that lacks unpleasant secondary meanings. “Slut” and “whore” are the types of slurs so gendered they are rarely hurled at men.</p><p>Google’s target, though, is the so-called generic masculine. For a long time English-language traditionalists said that “the masculine includes the feminine”. Under this rule, “everyone has his own opinion” is gender-neutral, and there is nothing wrong with generic chairmen, airmen and firemen. (In other languages, mixed or unknown persons are referred to in the masculine, too.) But using words like “chairman” and “sex-neutral ‘he’” are not truly gender-neutral: a stack of research proves that when people read those terms they are much more likely to picture a man than a woman.</p><p>In some European countries, feminists have called for feminised job titles, so that a woman president in Spain is now “la presidenta” and not “el presidente”. But Anglophone feminists have argued the other way, abjuring rather than recommending specific, feminised titles like poetess and actress. And this does not solve the problem of what to do with a generic referent, where languages still tend to default to the masculine.</p><p>A solution in English is to prefer newer, genderless titles like “mail carrier” and “police officer”. But even here there are difficulties. Some titles seem especially ugly in this form: no one seems to love (and therefore want to adopt) “chairperson” and even though “chair” is fine for some observers, others cannot see past the piece of furniture. There is further disagreement over whether such forms should be universal or whether it is acceptable to call a male officer a “policeman”.</p><p>With this much unsettled, tech companies are walking a difficult line. There is growing acceptance that sexist language is a problem; at the same time, there is also a widespread belief that the tech giants are becoming too powerful, and are making policy decisions that are momentous in users’ daily lives without enough clarity or insight into how those decisions were reached.</p><p>All big companies are under increasing pressure not just to sell their widgets but to take a stance on the hot-button issues of the day. Often they find that trying to please one constituency outrages another; trying later to split the difference outrages the first one again, and so on. Companies that make coffee machines or shoes have already run into these problems. When the tech giants weigh in on politics, their huge influence virtually guarantees a backlash from one party or another.</p><p>There are good things tech companies can do for inclusivity: at the same conference at which the language changes were announced, Google said it would improve its smartphone cameras’ handling of black and brown skin. But in language, the solutions are less obvious—even among people who agree on the problem.</p><p><a id="the-postal-service-enabled-america%E2%80%99s-westward-expansion"></a></p><h1 id="The-postal-service-enabled-America’s-westward-expansion"><a href="#The-postal-service-enabled-America’s-westward-expansion" class="headerlink" title="The postal service enabled America’s westward expansion"></a>The postal service enabled America’s westward expansion</h1><p>“Paper Trails” offers a timely reminder that the post has always been political</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Paper Trails. By Cameron Blevins. Oxford University Press; 248 pages; $34.95 and £22.99</p><p>Before colorado was a territory, let alone a state, it had post offices. The first opened in 1859 in Auraria, a mining settlement founded by migrants from the South searching for gold. Life could be unpredictable west of the Mississippi. Gold failed to materialise, drought ruined farmers and settlers clashed with Native Americans. Soon Auraria merged with a rival company town—Denver City. Today a sprawling university campus stands on its location. Amid all the upheaval, argues Cameron Blevins, a historian at the University of Colorado-Denver, one feature remained constant: the postal service.</p><p>Rather than focusing on ideas that were spread by the post, in “Paper Trails” Mr Blevins considers the infrastructure of the agency itself. Using a database compiled by Richard Helbock, a postal historian, he charts the rapid opening and closure of post offices in the second half of the 19th century—thereby tracing America’s westward expansion.</p><p>The maps in the book are telling. In 1864 there were few branches on land controlled by Native Americans, which still accounted for most of the West. Over the next 25 years, as indigenous people were killed or forced onto government reservations, the dots representing post offices multiply exponentially (see map). Using these as a proxy for settlement, Mr Blevins regards colonisation of the West as a result of big government rather than rugged individualism. As federal subsidies and land grants coaxed easterners into the mountains, deserts and high plains of Indian Country, the post kept them connected.</p><p>In the mid-19th century the Post Office Department (as the United States Postal Service was formerly known) was far from a centralised bureaucracy. To keep up with migration patterns, postal services were grafted onto existing businesses. The federal government commissioned private stagecoaches to carry the mail, and granted short-term contracts to local businessmen (and sometimes women) to act as town postmasters. These flexible partnerships enabled the mail quickly to follow migrants, helping knit together far-flung parts of a vast country.</p><p>“Paper Trails” is a reminder that, long before the recent wrangles over postal voting, the post was political. Until 1971 the postal service was a cabinet-level department in the executive branch, and jobs within it were doled out as patronage. Of the 80,000 appointments submitted to the Senate for approval between 1829 and 1917, nearly 62,000 were for post-office jobs. The facilities themselves were often turned into de facto campaign headquarters where partisans wooed voters. Congressmen were frequently caught up in rows over who should be postmasters in their districts. A friend of Jules Sandoz, a Nebraska postmaster, voiced his exasperation with postal politicking: “Why did you have to spend your whole life fighting over stupid things like post offices, Jules?”</p><p>For all that, the existence of the 19th-century postal service was not itself divisive. Democrats and Republicans alike stuffed the department with supporters; to please constituents, congressmen from both parties sought more routes in their districts. Today the post remains popular: last year 91% of Americans viewed the agency favourably. Yet Donald Trump and Republican legislators were contemptuous of it, and of postal voting in particular.</p><p>One of the most striking aspects of “Paper Trails” isn’t in the book. Mr Blevins is a digital historian, meaning he uses data science to analyse historical trends. He built an accompanying website replete with interactive maps to show readers how, within a generation, the postal service helped colonise a continent. These online dispatches beautifully illustrate the formative power of snail mail. </p><p><a id="obituary---josep-almud%C3%A9ver-died-on-may-23rd"></a></p><h1 id="Obituary-—Josep-Almudever-died-on-May-23rd"><a href="#Obituary-—Josep-Almudever-died-on-May-23rd" class="headerlink" title="(Obituary)—Josep Almudéver died on May 23rd"></a>(Obituary)—Josep Almudéver died on May 23rd</h1><p>The last known member of the International Brigades was 101</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Old soldiers often lose their enthusiasm for fighting. They speak instead of peace and, in fading voices, warn the young against the folly of war. Not so Josep Almudéver. At the drop of a hat he would unfurl the Spanish Republican flag he always carried with him, yellow, red and purple, the colours of dawn, and drape it proudly round his shoulders. He would rather forget to eat, than forget that flag. Then he would raise his clenched fist, shout “Viva el socialismo!” in a voice still carrying and clear, and break into a Republican song. No stopping him.</p><p>He was still at heart the boy of 17 who tried all the recruitment offices round his village, Alcàsser in the province of Valencia, to enlist in the fight to save the Second Republic from Francisco Franco’s fascists. The moment Franco’s coup against the elected government ignited the civil war, in July 1936, he had to join up. He was too young, but “You won’t stop him marching,” his father told the secretary at the Socialist Party office, who then obligingly accepted his age as 19. He was still 17, on the bleak, freezing front line at Teruel in Aragon where the Republican forces were trying to dislodge Franco’s troops, when shrapnel ploughed into his chest and shoulder. But it didn’t hurt for long and, after some weeks, he was looking for a front line again.</p><p>After the defeat at Teruel, where the airpower of Nazi Germany came to Franco’s aid, many Republicans lost stomach for the fight. He was all the keener. His youth was still a problem, though—unless he enlisted as a foreigner. Luckily he was both French and Spanish, born in Marseille when his valenciano father was looking for work there. So in May 1938, flaunting his French side, he joined the International Brigades. He was now part of a force of some 40,000 fighters who had flocked to Spain to save the world from fascism, by saving the Republic first. They came from all over Europe, Asia and America, and in every left-wing colour: socialists, communists, anarchists and Trotskyists, with a fringe of writers, drifters and romantics. It was like being on a medieval crusade, but with rifles and artillery (when it turned up) and a role as shock troops, helping as needed. The Brigades were his ideal of what the Left could be, like the Popular Front forged from Spain’s warring parties in 1936: all factions uniting to bring down capitalism and raise up the working class.</p><p>His brigade, 129, was the latest to be formed and, as it turned out, the last. The fighters were fresh, even scoring small victories in the general Republican retreat. Huge previous losses meant that most brigadistas by then were Spaniards, but his own division had a Dutchman, a German, a Swiss, an American (their chief mechanic), even a Chinaman. His regular comrade, David, was Canadian. They could barely talk to each other, but got on fine. There were no conflicts. Others reported plenty of strife in the Brigades, as well as the overpowering camp smell of rotting oats and urine, the same old bean stew eaten out of dirty tins, and the tedium of weeks spent waiting for orders from their Republican commanders. He did not even mind the waiting much.</p><p>Besides, as he kept stressing, the Republic did not lose the war. It was betrayed by the non-intervention pact signed by the major Western powers in 1936, pledging to keep out of the struggle. When he had marched away from Alcàsser on that shining September morning, the peoplecheering mightily, he carried an antiquated rifle and no bullets, because the French now refused to send the munitions which Spain had ordered and paid for. Fascist Italy and Germany, however, ignored the pact and piled in on Franco’s side, as at Teruel. Pobre República, poor Republic, he sighed. Against criminals like those, it hadn’t stood a chance. As for the idea that Spain’s was a “civil war”, how stupid that was. It was a world war fought on one small, bloody stage.</p><p>Everything might have been different. When the Republic was first declared in 1931, he saw freedom explode in the streets. The new government brought in secular schools and votes for women, but Catholic opponents gave the poor food and bedsheets, and votes slipped away. He began to read newspapers to the local peasants, two-thirds of them illiterate, explaining that socialism would build a better world. He still believed it would when, in October 1938, the Republican government doomed itself by telling all its foreign fighters to go home. It was hoping for the same gesture from Franco, with his thousands of Germans and Italians and Moroccans, but those did not leave. Pobre República.</p><p>He did not go to France, as he could have done. Instead he lingered unhappily in Valencia, and was arrested. He was sent for several months to the Albatera concentration camp, where he was made to watch the executions of Republican fighters as young as himself. Their screams still haunted him and filled his eyes with tears. After more months in an ordinary prison he was released, but went on fighting as a maqui in the north-east until, in 1947, he fled into definitive exile at Pamiers, near Toulouse. He had a young family now, and could not keep taking risks. He settled to his father’s trade of building and bricklaying.</p><p>Nothing, however, dulled his passionate interest in the progress or non-progress of the Left. Its divisions continued to frustrate him, both in France and in Spain, to which he was not allowed to return until 1965. Why was it so hard for the Socialists and Podemos to unite for the good of the workers? Because they were still in thrall to capitalists, as the Second Republic, too, had turned out to be. The rich always ended up winning, he would say, scornfully rubbing his fingertips together. Money ruled. The king, “Colonel” Juan Carlos as he called him, had sent him a million pesetas for enduring prison, but he wouldn’t touch it. He didn’t want it.</p><p>Instead, in his flat in Pamiers, his riches lay around him: posters, scarves, medals and plaques glowing with yellow, red and purple. Che Guevara’s face was on the wall, and beside it his own young face, with the same rapt expression of waiting for the great socialist dawn. If Spain still needed him, he would take up arms. And on foot, ancient but agile, he would cross the Pyrenees. </p>]]></content>

But busy café terraces in Paris and beyond suggest that, after months of home cooking, many Europeans are ready to put up with a little discomfort to get out of the kitchen. For now only al fresco service is allowed across much of the eu, sometimes paired with curfews. The prospect of a return to normality in the months ahead must suffice to warm diners’ spirits during cloudbursts.</p><p>It may be a mild annoyance to those huddled under improvised awnings to think of Americans and Britons mostly feasting indoors these days. That mainland Europe is several weeks behind in reopening restaurants (and the economy more generally) is largely caused by the botched start of its vaccination drive. Now the jabbing has gained speed. Normality feels within sight. Tourist hotspots think they can avoid a rerun of the difficult summer of 2020; economists are busy upgrading growth forecasts. But not everywhere is feeling the benefits of vaccines yet.</p><p>eu citizens are still far less protected than their American and British counterparts. Just 47% of adults have received their first jab, compared with 67% in America and 75% in Britain. (The figures for second jabs are 22%, 54% and 49%.) A lack of doses at the start of the year meant the eu’s pace of vaccination was about six weeks behind America’s and ten weeks behind Britain’s. At last, however, supply bottlenecks in Europe have eased.</p><p>The steady ramp-up of vaccinations in the eu, paired with a drop-off in America, means the two will converge soon enough (see chart 1). Europe wants 70% of its adult population fully vaccinated by summer, whereas America has set a target of 64% by July 4th. A few things need to go right for Europe to reach its goal, but the prospect of overtaking America in the second half of the year is not far-fetched.</p><p>The ramp-up in vaccinations is good news for diners—and the European Commission. The eu’s executive arm in Brussels was hurriedly put in charge of procuring vaccines for the bloc’s 445m citizens last year. Its purchases arrived more slowly than those of America and Britain, which had ensured speedy access to jabs by helping to fund the vaccines’ development and signing early contracts with drug firms.</p><p>In particular, shortfalls in deliveries by AstraZeneca, purveyor of a cheap vaccine, slowed vaccination. Partly as a result, at the height of the crisis Europe brought in export controls to divert supplies to its own citizens. That jarred with its desire to be seen as an open economy helping the world to face the pandemic. But efforts by Eurocrats to get more doses have paid off. Europe is now receiving roughly as much vaccine per inhabitant as America. Thierry Breton, the European commissioner put in charge of turbocharging deliveries, says the eu will be able to make 3bn doses of vaccines a year by the end of 2021.</p><p>More jabs, more jobs<br>The joint procurement plan was meant to ensure that all eu citizens got vaccinated at roughly the same speed. Having each European country go it alone would have resulted in some places with vastly higher vaccination rates than others. This would undermine Europe’s unity in the face of a crisis, and make open borders, for everything from goods to tourists, untenable.</p><p>Yet months into the vaccination drive the overall eu figure masks a worrying range of outcomes (see chart 2). Malta, the member state with the smallest population, is near Israeli (ie, world-beating) levels of inoculation. At the other end of the scale, Bulgaria is lagging badly behind. The poorest member state has put 24 needles in arms for every 100 adults, a third of the eu average. Most of the laggards are in the poorer east of the bloc.</p><p>That eu citizens would end up vaccinated in lockstep depended on two assumptions. The first was that each country would get the same number of doses relative to population. The second was that national governments would prove roughly as adept at converting doses delivered into arms injected. Neither is true.</p><p>On deliveries, some countries have had to make do with less vaccine than their neighbours. The eu scheme works by giving countries an option to buy a set number of doses of various approved vaccines. Many poorer countries last year plumped for relatively more AstraZeneca, which was cheaper and easier to handle. In contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs were often favoured by richer countries. (Hungary, whose prime minister, Viktor Orban, is always keen to needle the eu, took delivery of Chinese and Russian jabs which are not approved at the European level.) So the AstraZeneca shortfall has affected some members, such as Bulgaria, more than others. The eu has tried to rectify this, notably by agreeing to send some of its spare Pfizer doses to the countries that are most deprived.</p><p>To make matters worse, not everyone is keen on the AstraZeneca jab. Reports of rare but potentially fatal blood clots have limited its use in some eu countries. Even though Britain has administered it to millions, America has yet to approve it. And Europe has pointedly failed to order any more of it, in part because relations with the company have soured.</p><p>As a result there are growing stockpiles of AstraZeneca doses in the eu’s fridges. Only three-quarters of the 54m doses delivered have been administered, compared with 95% of Pfizer’s serum. Romania has used barely a third of its AstraZeneca stocks; Bulgaria less than half. Part of the reason France has fallen behind Germany in its vaccination rate is because of 3m unused shots of le AstraZeneca.</p><p>Other factors have held back vaccination, particularly in some eastern European countries. Many of their citizens live in richer parts of the eu and may have been jabbed there, skewing their home countries’ national tallies. Minorities, for example the Roma in Romania or Hungary, seem harder to reach. Health systems were often struggling before the pandemic. There has been plenty of disinformation on the safety of inoculations. And good old administrative incompetence has all too often slowed things down.</p><p>Fortunately, vaccine scepticism seems to be less common than once feared. Europeans have flocked to be inoculated at higher rates than opinion polls suggested they would. That said, the proportion of Europeans who have been vaccinated is now reaching the level at which the pace of injections began to slow in America.</p><p>Europe is trying to paint its slow start as a sign of virtue. By allowing more exports of vaccines, in contrast to America, it looked after some people in poorer countries. But it has faced flak for resisting an American-led campaign to loosen intellectual-property rules around vaccines. A startling order for a further 900m-1.8bn doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab signed last month suggests the eu will have plenty to give away in years to come.</p><p>Covid-19 cases have fallen across the eu as they did at the same time last year. That is probably thanks to a mix of warmer weather (notwithstanding the odd shower) and vaccines, though the eu is watching the spread across Britain of a new variant, first spotted in India, with concern. A system of “covid passports” allowing people to travel across European borders if they have been tested or jabbed is being set up. After soggy dinners, it may be the prospect of a sunny beach that gets people to the vaccination centre. </p><p><a id="a-christian-a-jew-and-a-muslim-walk-into-the-same-house-of-worship"></a></p><h1 id="A-Christian-a-Jew-and-a-Muslim-walk-into-the-same-house-of-worship…"><a href="#A-Christian-a-Jew-and-a-Muslim-walk-into-the-same-house-of-worship…" class="headerlink" title="A Christian, a Jew and a Muslim walk into the same house of worship…"></a>A Christian, a Jew and a Muslim walk into the same house of worship…</h1><p>Berlin’s new House of One seeks to cater for them all</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It is usually bad news when multiple religions claim the same place of worship. It can lead to conflict, as illustrated by the recent violence at Jerusalem’s holiest site. Or it can be a sign that flocks are dwindling, forcing congregations to share space. But Berlin’s House of One intentionally puts a church, mosque and synagogue under a single roof.</p><p>The cornerstone of the €47m ($57m) place of worship was laid last week near Alexanderplatz. In four years’ time, it will be a structure housing three separate prayer rooms and a 46m-high domed hall for the faiths to mix. “We are building the House to make a statement,” says Rabbi Andreas Nachama, one of the project’s leaders.</p><p>The idea has been in the works for a decade, since local leaders from the three Abrahamic religions came together to think up a plan for a religiously significant spot: the former site of one of Berlin’s oldest churches.</p><p>An interfaith project made more sense than another church, says Father Gregor Hohberg, a Protestant pastor whose congregation once worshipped at the site. “In Berlin we have a lot of very wonderful churches,” he points out. “And all of these churches are not full of people on Sunday mornings.” Berlin, after all, is better known for sex clubs and party drugs than piety. Still, another 120 people have already joined Father Hohberg’s congregation, years in advance. Supporters can also sponsor bricks for €10 each.</p><p>An ecumenical mega-sanctuary comes with disagreements. In the synagogue, Orthodox Jews insisted on separate seating for men and women. In the church, the big debate was whether the altar should face east or west.</p><p>Even before the doors have opened, the House of One is yielding revelations. Archaeologists have discovered around 4,000 skeletons at the site, dating back to the middle of the 12th century, suggesting Berlin is a century older than previously thought.</p><p><a id="a-law-to-break-the-mafia%E2%80%99s-code-of-silence-lets-a-killer-go-free"></a></p><h1 id="A-law-to-break-the-Mafia’s-code-of-silence-lets-a-killer-go-free"><a href="#A-law-to-break-the-Mafia’s-code-of-silence-lets-a-killer-go-free" class="headerlink" title="A law to break the Mafia’s code of silence lets a killer go free"></a>A law to break the Mafia’s code of silence lets a killer go free</h1><p>Giovanni Brusca served only 25 years for multiple murders</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Shortly after nine o’clock on a Monday night, Giovanni Brusca, his brother, their wives and children had abruptly to abandon their roast-chicken dinner. Armed, masked police burst into their rented villa and arrested both men.</p><p>That was in 1996. On May 31st Mr Brusca left prison in Rome, a free man after serving 25 years of a 30-year sentence imposed for, among many murders, that in 1992 of Italy’s most renowned anti-Mafia prosecutor, Giovanni Falcone. Few recent events have stirred greater revulsion than the release of this former Mafia boss, nicknamed u Verru, (the Pig) in Sicilian. “This is not the justice Italy deserves,” railed Matteo Salvini, the leader of the populist Northern League.</p><p>The emotional reaction was surely understandable. Mr Brusca was a leading associate of the late capo dei capi, the boss of bosses—namely the psychopathic Salvatore “Totò’” Riina. In the early 1990s Riina launched a terrorist campaign against the Italian state that involved lethal bombings in several mainland cities, the assassination of Falcone and the later killing of Falcone’s colleague, Paolo Borsellino. It was Mr Brusca who detonated the bomb that killed Falcone, his wife and bodyguards. And when one of the other members of the hit squad, Santino Di Matteo, was arrested and turned state’s evidence, it was Mr Brusca who conspired to silence him by kidnapping his 12-year-old son. After holding him captive for more than two years, he had the boy strangled and his body dissolved in acid.</p><p>Ironically, Mr Brusca himself turned state’s evidence after his own arrest. After initially misleading interrogators, he began giving them valuable intelligence on the Sicilian Mafia, better known as Cosa Nostra. His co-operation let him escape a life sentence because of a law sponsored, just as ironically, by Falcone. That law has helped police and prosecutors turn several other top Mafiosi and helped steadily to weaken the Mafia over the past 25 years. Cosa Nostra is now less powerful than either the Calabrian ’Ndrangheta or the Neapolitan Camorra.</p><p>Falcone’s sister, Maria, has said she is saddened by Mr Brusca’s release. But, she added, “That is the law—and a law that my brother wanted—so it must be respected.” Her brother, one suspects, would have been proud of her. </p><p><a id="the-era-of-small-state-privilege-in-europe-is-coming-to-an-end"></a></p><h1 id="The-era-of-small-state-privilege-in-Europe-is-coming-to-an-end"><a href="#The-era-of-small-state-privilege-in-Europe-is-coming-to-an-end" class="headerlink" title="The era of small-state privilege in Europe is coming to an end"></a>The era of small-state privilege in Europe is coming to an end</h1><p>Luxembourg and Malta still have vetoes, but power is shifting to big states</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“One person, one vote” is a good principle. The ratio in the European Union is a bit more complex: “One Luxembourger, or nine Germans, one vote.” Germany has one mep for every 860,000 citizens. By contrast Luxembourg—a country roughly the size of Düsseldorf—has one per 100,000.</p><p>A disproportionate parliamentary weighting is one of many perks enjoyed by the eu’s gang of small states. Three-quarters of the bloc’s population live in just seven countries; the remainder is spread over the other 20. For them, membership is a sweet deal. Their politicians can wangle top jobs, usually as compromise candidates. A common currency gives smaller European economies a say in monetary matters, rather than being thrown around like a ragdoll by the Bundesbank, as they were before the euro. When it comes to topics such as tax, foreign policy, or changing the eu’s treaties, they wield vetoes. This means Malta (population: 500,000) can have as much say as Italy (population: 60m) when shaping a club of 450m. The eu acts as a geopolitical magnifying glass, making small countries appear much larger.</p><p>Within the eu, small states can, for once, shape history rather than be victims of it. In times of crisis, leaders used to running a country with a gdp equivalent to the turnover of a middling s&amp; p 500 company sit round the table with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, ostensibly as equals. It is little wonder that at their first such meeting, some leaders have the giddy demeanour of a weekend footballer meeting Cristiano Ronaldo. For big countries, the eu is about clinging on to the remains of their former clout; for small ones, the eu has made them more powerful than they could ever have dreamed.</p><p>Alas, for the eu’s army of tiddlers, this golden era of tiny but mighty states is drawing to a close. Take tax, an area where small countries have long enjoyed their own exorbitant privilege. In a bloc where capital can flow freely, imposing lighter taxes than a near neighbour is a lucrative trick. Ireland and Luxembourg transformed themselves from nations of farmers and steelmakers respectively into two of the richest countries on the planet by undercutting larger neighbours on tax. Capital flooded in, along with complaints from next door. Since the eu can legislate on tax only by unanimity, there was little the bloc could do. It asked them nicely to change. They said no.</p><p>Times, however, are changing. Joe Biden, America’s president, has launched a crackdown on companies that book improbable shares of their profits in low-tax jurisdictions, promising to whack punitive taxes on them. Ireland, which has a 12.5% corporate-tax rate, is sweating. With America leading the way, other big countries are set to sign up to the scheme. There is not much Ireland and friends can do to stop it. The commission, meanwhile, is still eyeing innovative ways of bypassing a country’s veto when it comes to tax, making ingenious but legally questionable use of provisions in the eu’s treaties. However it is done, the main perk of the small-country club is on the way out.</p><p>Citizenship, like tax, is another fundamental right of states. Who but the Maltese government ought to decide who is Maltese? Malta and Cyprus have used this power to make easy money, hawking the right to live and work in the eu to anyone willing to spend a few million euros on government bonds or an expensive flat overlooking the Mediterranean. But when a national passport also confers citizenship of the eu, it becomes every member’s business, some feel. The commission is taking steps to crack down on the practice. Another small-country privilege—to dish out passports however they see fit—is disappearing.</p><p>A passport from a small country was once a shortcut to high office in the eu. In European politics, the scale of the job used to be inverse to the size of their home country. People were happier to be bossed around by a Portuguese or a Luxembourger, rather than someone from France or Germany. (Luxembourg has produced as many commission presidents as France and Germany combined.) Things are moving on. Germany, in particular, is now more comfortable laying claim to big jobs. Ursula von der Leyen was the first German to lead the European Commission since the 1960s. The European Central Bank, the institution which has done most to keep the euro together, has been led by bigger countries since its inception. Big countries want their people in senior posts.</p><p>If anything symbolises the outsized power of small countries, it is the veto. On certain topics, a solitary “no” can still derail plans. But patience with this arrangement is wearing thin. Hungary, in particular, has adopted an obstructive instead of merely bombastic approach to Brussels. Rather than noisily railing against the eu while quietly going along with it, the country has made a virtue of blocking foreign-policy moves on such things as human rights in China. Yet whenever a sovereigntist like Viktor Orban wields a veto, the eu’s federalists begin to cheer, arguing that he is making their case for them. An eu that relies more on qualified-majority voting is grinding forwards.</p><p>The small-country conundrum<br>One unspoken consequence of the eu becoming more democratic is that its small states must become less powerful. While national governments still hold sway in the eu, they create an imbalance. The eu was founded to rein in the excesses of big European powers, not to replace them with the (admittedly less bloody) excesses of their smaller peers. A bloc where some citizens have more say than others is not a healthy one. True, other continental-sized polities struggle with this question. In America, South Dakota has the same number of senators as California. But that is no excuse to copy their mistakes. Europe’s small countries should not fear losing clout. Until now they maintained their individual power as part of a weaker whole. In the future, they will play a smaller role in a stronger bloc. It is a different deal, but still sweet. </p><p><a id="britain---boris-johnson-seeks-a-state-fit-for-crisis"></a></p><h1 id="Britain-—Boris-Johnson-seeks-a-state-fit-for-crisis"><a href="#Britain-—Boris-Johnson-seeks-a-state-fit-for-crisis" class="headerlink" title="(Britain)—Boris Johnson seeks a state fit for crisis"></a>(Britain)—Boris Johnson seeks a state fit for crisis</h1><p>Efficiency gives way to resilience, and a new age of stockpiling, drills and imaging the worst</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The british government thought its preparations for a pandemic to be among the best in the world. In 2016, 950 officials drilled for an outbreak of “swan flu”, a hypothetical illness which killed 400,000 people. It gave ministers some useful pointers on enlisting retired doctors and drafting emergency legislation.</p><p>Yet the planners did not prepare for a virus that could spread asymptomatically. Since they did not imagine a national lockdown, no plans for a furlough scheme were drafted. The permanent secretary at the business department was not even aware the exercise had taken place. The planners fretted about how the public would react to mass burials and soldiers on the streets. The resulting report stayed secret. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former aide, told mps last month that when a pandemic actually struck, Whitehall froze.</p><p>Mr Johnson now wants to build a more muscular state, which intervenes in the market, and tells judges and museum curators what’s what. He wants it to be harder, too: less permeable to hostile states and readier for emergencies. Successive governments have trimmed fat from public services, and chased foreign investment. Mr Johnson is twisting the dials back, from openness to guardedness, and from efficiency to resilience. Defence of the realm is the spirit of the age (see chart). Think-tanks that churned out papers on slimming the state under David Cameron, prime minister from 2010 to 2016, now bristle with ideas for how to toughen it up.</p><p>Covid-19 is one factor; concerns over China another. Brexit has shaken old certainties. Ministers are spooked by French sabre-rattling over electricity supplies in fishing negotiations. “For a long time we thought it was the ‘end of history’,” says Alan Mendoza of the Henry Jackson Society, a security-policy think-tank attuned to the government’s thinking. “We didn’t realise the system was being challenged on such a dramatic scale by others.”</p><p>Risk will be weighed differently. Since its creation in 2001, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, Britain’s emergency-planning unit, has focused on likely emergencies, such as terrorist attacks and flooding. In future, it will prepare more for the improbable yet catastrophic, such as nuclear accidents, and crises unfolding simultaneously. Ministers plan a whizzy “situation centre”, bristling with data feeds.</p><p>Health policy will look more like counter-terrorism. England’s sluggish public-health agency has been broken up and replaced by a new body focused on epidemics and other emergencies. The new Joint Biosecurity Centre, which scans for outbreaks, has been built by securocrats and is modelled on Britain’s terrorism-analysis centre. The government wants ppe to be made in Britain, breaking its reliance on China. A new state vaccine factory is due to open in the autumn.</p><p>Britons, it turned out, didn’t panic, and will be expected to continue to do their bit. The “integrated review” of Britain’s defence and foreign policy published in March advocated a Scandinavian-style “whole-of-society” posture. Penny Mordaunt, a minister responsible for civil contingencies and co-author of “Greater: Britain after the storm”, wants the state to harness those who volunteered to battle coronavirus, directing them towards “national missions”, such as elderly care. Ministers plan to overhaul military reserves, and create a new cadre of civilian reservists, such as retired doctors and civil servants, who can be mobilised in crises. It is a radical shift, says Elisabeth Braw of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, from the prevailing idea of government as “an umbrella that spreads across society, so the rest of us don’t have to do anything”.</p><p>Britain can only continue to be open, officials argue, if it is more secure against hostile states. A toughened foreign-investment screening law came into force in April. Ministers plan powers to block stock-exchange listings on national-security grounds, and to shield university research from espionage. The Home Office intends to modernise the Official Secrets Act, and to adopt an American-style register of lobbyists and ad men acting for foreign interests. Last year the government acknowledged the existence of jstat, a Whitehall body monitoring hostile states.</p><p>Most of these grand plans still have to be implemented, and the culture of Whitehall does not encourage crisis planning. Ministers churn through departments. The government has never held so much data, yet ministers say they feel in the dark about threats. Ms Mordaunt thinks they need mandatory crisis-training, and Whitehall rigorous and regular exercises.</p><p>At the moment, risks are divvied up among departments, and those that are not in charge often do little—thus the Department for Education had no plans for home schooling when the pandemic hit. Plans are not scrutinised by mps, or external watchdogs. The answer, says Sir David Lidington, a former cabinet office minister, is greater pressure from the prime minister, and binding targets for improving resilience. “If you don’t get a clear direction from the most senior political level, inertia creeps in,” he says.</p><p>A more resilient state will be expensive, at a time when money will be tight. The trajectory for the public finances is uncertain, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has already pencilled in further cuts to all departments other than health, schooling and defence. Mr Johnson has other priorities, including busting a backlog in courts and hospitals, and “levelling up” poor towns. Greater restrictions on foreign investment will mean lower tax revenues, and paying more for infrastructure.</p><p>Mr Cameron’s years of austerity left public services less able to handle covid-19. ppe stockpiles dwindled and municipal emergency-planning budgets were cut by 35% in a decade. Britain has fewer hospital beds than France and Germany per person. Ministers face difficult choices, say officials, over whether to direct spending to new projects or to put “contingent capability” (ie, slack) back into the system. That sort of capability was once hard to justify, but crisis has revived an old idea of the state; one that fears the worst, and attends to the just-in-case. </p><p><a id="rishi-sunak-is-worried-about-rising-interest-rates-he-should-relax"></a></p><h1 id="Rishi-Sunak-is-worried-about-rising-interest-rates-He-should-relax"><a href="#Rishi-Sunak-is-worried-about-rising-interest-rates-He-should-relax" class="headerlink" title="Rishi Sunak is worried about rising interest rates.

He should relax</h1><p>British debts are unusually mature</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Pandemics are an expensive business for governments. In the past year the British state’s borrowing came to more than 14% of gdp, the highest figure in over seven decades. All that extra borrowing helped push the ratio of government debt to gdp from around 80% to nearly 100%.</p><p>For the moment this is proving less costly than expected. Debt may have risen but interest costs have fallen. In the financial year to March, interest payments amounted to 1.1% of gdp, down from 1.7% the year before. But that could change. Like a homeowner with a large mortgage nervously eyeing an interest-rate calculator, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is worried about what will happen if it does.</p><p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, a fiscal watchdog, has helpfully done the sums for Mr Sunak. He has taken to peppering his speeches with a warning that if interest rates and inflation were both to rise by one percentage point then the exchequer’s interest bills would increase by £25bn ($35bn), an amount equivalent to the Department for Transport’s annual budget. Underpinning the Treasury’s worry is a fear that quantitative easing has had a paradoxical impact on public finances: helping to contain borrowing costs for now, but increasing the government’s exposure to short-term interest rates.</p><p>Since 2009 the Bank of England’s quantitative-easing programme, through which it electronically creates reserves to purchase bonds, has made it a big player in the government-debt markets. In April the bank became the largest holder of British government gilts, with around a third of the outstanding stock now sitting on its balance-sheet.</p><p>One advantage of quantitative easing for the government is that debt held by the bank is cheaper to service. It only has to pay the rate of interest charged on reserves at the Bank of England, which is 0.1%, rather than higher rates on the market. But there is a potential downside. Whereas a rise in Bank Rate would once have taken years to feed through to government-borrowing costs, because much of the debt would have been issued when rates were lower, nowadays its impact would be felt straight away.</p><p>The Treasury should nevertheless relax a little. Over the past decades, and especially since 2010, the Debt Management Office, which issues Britain’s government debt, has worked to lengthen the maturity profile of that borrowing, insulating the government from short-term rate rises. Indeed, Britain has the longest average maturity of any advanced economy. On May 27th Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank of England’s monetary-policy committee, pointed out that even if one accounts for the impact of quantitative easing by assigning a maturity of zero to all debt held by the bank, Britain still compares favourably with its peers (see chart).</p><p>A scenario in which interest rates and inflation rise would see the cost of government borrowing increase. But such a scenario would almost certainly include healthier tax receipts, since rising interest rates normally follow economic growth. All of this means that Britain’s public finances are more sustainable than the usual headline measures suggest. Mr Sunak has no need to panic. </p><p><a id="england%E2%80%99s-school-catch-up-tsar-resigns-in-protest"></a></p><h1 id="England’s-school-catch-up-tsar-resigns-in-protest"><a href="#England’s-school-catch-up-tsar-resigns-in-protest" class="headerlink" title="England’s school catch-up tsar resigns in protest"></a>England’s school catch-up tsar resigns in protest</h1><p>He says the government is failing to pull out the stops</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In february the government appointed Sir Kevan Collins, a former teacher, council boss and head of an education charity, to advise it on how to help children catch up on learning lost as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, said he was “absolutely determined” no child would be held back by the crisis. Just four months later, on June 2nd, Sir Kevan resigned as “education-recovery commissioner” because of a lack of ministerial determination.</p><p>He stepped down hours after the government announced details of its plans, which included an additional £1.4bn ($2bn) on top of the £1.7bn already set aside for school catch-up programmes. Most of the new money will boost efforts to provide struggling pupils with tutors. Schools will also be able to use some of it to pay for extra instruction from existing teachers and for staff to go on training courses. The government says its investment will allow England’s pupils to share an additional 100m hours of tutoring over the next three years, mostly bundled into courses lasting 15 hours each.</p><p>Although the announcement almost doubles the government’s spending on catch-up, it was nonetheless a shadow of the grand recovery plan that teachers, parents and education wonks had expected. Hopes had been raised by the appointment of Sir Kevan, who is widely respected. On June 1st the Times newspaper reported that he was trying to convince the government to support a package of measures that might cost around £15bn over three years. As well as more tutoring, his proposals reportedly included providing all pupils with an extra 100 hours of schooling a year, an amount equivalent to adding 30 minutes to every school day.</p><p>According to the Education Policy Institute (epi), a think-tank, the latest spending commitment means the government has stumped up around £310 for every schoolchild. By contrast, American lawmakers have provided £1,600 per pupil. The Netherlands has provided £2,500. An official study published in February found primary-school children in England had fallen two-to-three months behind in reading and maths. The epi guesses that as a result of additional school closures they may now have fallen back another month or so. The think-tank notes that during a typical year the government spends £16bn providing education for four months, roughly the amount Sir Kevan had sought to extract from ministers.</p><p>Boris Johnson has denied the government is being miserly. He said that prioritising spending on tutoring is the best way of reaching pupils who most need help, and that more money for schools is “coming down the track”. Gavin Williamson, the secretary of state for education, said the government is still looking into the idea of longer school days and that it would make a decision later in the year. In his letter of resignation, Sir Kevan bemoaned the government’s “incremental approach to recovery”. The longer struggling pupils wait for assistance, the more likely they are to continue falling behind. </p><p><a id="london-is-starting-to-build-more-council-homes"></a></p><h1 id="London-is-starting-to-build-more-council-homes"><a href="#London-is-starting-to-build-more-council-homes" class="headerlink" title="London is starting to build more council homes"></a>London is starting to build more council homes</h1><p>Overcoming nimbys and space constraints to do so</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>To the untrained eye, the small football pitch and bumpy grass mounds between two post-war council flat blocks in Bells Garden estate do not look like much. To Lewis Schaffer, a professional comic from New York who lives nearby, they are the front line in a battle with Southwark council. If the council gets its way three new blocks will soon fill the space. Mr Schaffer sees this as the height of stupidity. “You wouldn’t build on Central Park, would you?”</p><p>London’s councils were once big housebuilders, building the majority of new homes in the capital in the 1960s and 1970s. Sadiq Khan, the mayor, wants a return to past glories. He promises 10,000 new council homes by 2023, funded by a £1bn ($1.4bn) investment pot. Things are heading in the right direction. Last year councils started on 3,156 residences, up from 454 in 2015. They are building at their fastest rate since the early 1980s.</p><p>To do so, they have to overcome two obstacles. One is a lack of land. Some 85% of the capital is built on and the remaining slivers are mostly parkland or protected by the “green belt”. Thus councils are left with little option other than to slot houses on their own land. The low-hanging fruit is unused bits of existing estates, says Tom Copley, the deputy mayor for housing.</p><p>Such an approach requires little demolition of existing homes but NIMBYs, the second obstacle, still object. In Southwark the waiting list for council homes stands at 15,000. Infill developments are proposed on some 28 post-war estates, replacing parks, garages and ballcourts with new flats, as part of plans to build just 11,000 new homes by 2043. But even this is proving heavy going.</p><p>These post-war estates were built to satisfy an ambitious new vision of working-class life. Developers bulldozed slums, replacing them with (often prefabricated) “streets in the sky”. Communal gardens meant residents could mingle and relax. Bells Garden might look shabby but its residents’ continued use of communal spaces lives up to these ideals (even if their relaxation comes tinged with a noticeable whiff of cannabis).</p><p>Sacrificing such small luxuries has driven protests. In Southwark locals have held rallies, fixed banners to ballcourts and raised funds for legal advice. A plan to build nine flats in Nunhead was shelved in March. Southwark council’s housing chief was forced to resign after he was found to be running an anonymous Twitter account called @SouthwarkYIMBY, which took pleasure in skewering the campaigners.</p><p>But not all infill meets opposition. By removing concrete dead space, one project in Islington was able to create gardens for local residents, ensuring their support. Alice Brownfield of Peter Barber Architects pulled off a similar trick in Camden by stitching 15 smart new brick homes into the existing estate. Gardens and extensions do, however, reduce the number of new residences.</p><p>In Southwark Mr Schaffer remains hopeful of victory, and in the justness of his cause. “We shouldn’t be made to feel resentful and selfish for caring about our homes,” he says. But Southwark’s rebellions have not deterred other councils from building. On May 19th next-door Lewisham announced plans to build on nine estates. NIMBYs have long had a hold on the capital. It is now loosening.</p><p><a id="boris-johnson%E2%80%99s-government-wants-more-patriotic-cultural-institutions"></a></p><h1 id="Boris-Johnson’s-government-wants-more-patriotic-cultural-institutions"><a href="#Boris-Johnson’s-government-wants-more-patriotic-cultural-institutions" class="headerlink" title="Boris Johnson’s government wants more patriotic cultural institutions"></a>Boris Johnson’s government wants more patriotic cultural institutions</h1><p>Grandees are appalled at ministerial interference</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Days before he retired at the end of 2015, Neil MacGregor addressed colleagues and friends at the British Museum. As they raised their glasses, he quoted T.S. Eliot: “For last year’s words belong to last year’s language. And next year’s words await another voice.” A few years on, however, the commanding voice in museumland is not his successor as director of the British Museum, nor is it another grandee. It is the government.</p><p>In February the chairman of the Royal Museums Greenwich, a devoted Tory, resigned after ministers blocked the reappointment of a trustee, an academic who reportedly advocated “decolonising” the history curriculum and had liked Labour Party content on Twitter. In March a trustee of the Science Museum withdrew her application for a second term after she was asked to “explicitly express support” for the government’s policy on the removal of contentious historical objects. “Today it is contested heritage. Tomorrow it may be another issue,” she wrote.</p><p>The interference is part of an effort by ministers to reshape British institutions to the tastes of the new Tory electorate—patriotic and more working-class than before—by shifting power from the country’s cultural elite. After a year in which commercial revenue has crashed, museums are vulnerable to being leant on (even before the covid-19 pandemic, they depended on the state for more than half their income). And Boris Johnson is clear about his preferences. He has lambasted Labour for “spending most of their time wondering which public statues to tear down or whether ‘Hereward the Wake’ should now be known as ‘Hereward the Woke’.”</p><p>This desire to reshape cultural institutions is not entirely new. After David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, the Conservative-led government wanted to root out the “Labour luvvies” it felt to have infiltrated the boards of Britain’s cultural institutions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Most trustees serve two terms of four years, which means that almost all existing ones have been approved by a Tory government. Mr Johnson’s government is demonstrating a greater willingness to actually intervene in the process.</p><p>Museum leaders have been informed of new expectations. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, privately rebuked Mr MacGregor’s successor, Hartwig Fischer, for moving a terracotta bust of the British Museum’s founder, Sir Hans Sloane, from a pedestal to a nearby cabinet. (As well as being an energetic collector, Sloane was a slave owner.) Mr Dowden went on to argue that: “The people who run [heritage organisations] need the courage to stand up to the political fads and noisy movements of the moment.”</p><p>He has also written to museum leaders to tell them that they should notify the government of any planned changes or public statements regarding controversial bits of history. Failure to comply could put funding at risk, the letter explained. One former museum director called the move “unprecedented”, saying “in terms of direct engagement of a government with the content of a museum, it marked an extraordinary constitutional step”.</p><p>Under the British trustee system, national museums are answerable to Parliament, rather than government ministers (as they are in France, for example). Yet at the first meeting of the newly formed government Heritage Advisory Board, in mid-May, Mr Dowden argued that museums should be bound by guidelines the government is drawing up which say to “retain and explain” controversial objects rather than removing them. The board includes Trevor Phillips, a broadcaster, and Robert Tombs, a Cambridge historian, both of whom have written in defence of controversial statues. It does not contain any museum directors.</p><p>European museums are heading in a different direction. On May 18th the Dutch king opened an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum examining how the country benefited from slave labour. Germany has agreed to return hundreds of objects that were stolen during the colonisation of Nigeria. Neither would now happen in Britain, a museum director says. The difference does not reflect public opinion. According to YouGov, a pollster, just one in three Britons believe the empire is something of which to be proud, compared with one in two Dutch.</p><p>Museum executives see the government’s moves as a breach of their historic independence, which, in the case of the British Museum, is enshrined in a parliamentary act from 1753. Twenty years ago Labour made free entry to museums a key government policy, but interference on questions of governance and programming is new. Insiders see the government’s moves as a breach of the arms-length relationship between museums and ministers that has lasted for decades. For the government to flex its muscles in this way is, a former director reckons, a “clear sign that this is about controlling and neutralising sources of opposition of all sorts.”</p><p>Historic opportunities<br>Along with the Royal Museums Greenwich, the National Gallery will soon start to search for a new chair, following the sudden resignation of Tony Hall on May 22nd after he was revealed to have ineffectively investigated journalistic malpractice at the bbc. Sir Richard Lambert is due to step down as chair of the British Museum next February. Many in the museum world will be watching carefully to see exactly how, rather than whether, the government will try to interfere. </p><p><a id="a-parallel-society-is-developing-in-parts-of-muslim-britain"></a></p><h1 id="A-parallel-society-is-developing-in-parts-of-Muslim-Britain"><a href="#A-parallel-society-is-developing-in-parts-of-Muslim-Britain" class="headerlink" title="A parallel society is developing in parts of Muslim Britain"></a>A parallel society is developing in parts of Muslim Britain</h1><p>As a new book by Ed Husain explains</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Britain has a glorious tradition of writers getting on their bikes, real or metaphorical, and pedalling off to discover the country. Two of the best examples of the genre were published during the Great Depression, J.B. Priestley’s “English Journey” (1934) and George Orwell’s “The Road to Wigan Pier” (1937). Bill Bryson had such a hit with “Notes from a Small Island” (1995), selling more than 2m copies, that he decided to repeat the exercise with “The Road to Little Dribbling” 20 years later.</p><p>Ed Husain’s new book, “Among the Mosques”, is a fascinating addition to this tradition, taking readers inside religious institutions that most non-Muslims only experience as domes on the horizon. The country’s first two mosques were founded in Liverpool in 1887, in a terraced house, and in Woking in 1889, on a grander scale. There are now almost 2,000 serving a Muslim population of more than 3m. Some heavily Muslim areas such as Blackburn’s Bastwell district have several in the same street. But what goes on inside? And what is their relationship with wider society?</p><p>Mr Husain is the ideal man to answer these questions. The son of an Indian father and a mother who migrated from what is today Bangladesh, he won a prize for reciting the Koran as a child and spent much of his 20s in the Middle East perfecting his Arabic. He has written two books on Islam and has a broad intellectual hinterland. He wrote a phd thesis under the supervision of the conservative British philosopher, Roger Scruton, and has worked for a number of think-tanks including the Council on Foreign Relations in America.</p><p>Mr Husain discovered much to be pleased about. Britain has absorbed a big Muslim population better than its ancient foe, France. On May 6th London re-elected its first Muslim mayor, Labour’s Sadiq Khan. Several young politicians such as Naz Shah, mp for Bradford West, represent the modern face of the religion.</p><p>There is also a darker story. The British establishment that presided over the immigration which followed the second world war expected Islamic migrants to melt into wider society and relax their religious views. But in parts of the country Muslim communities are distancing themselves from wider British society and adopting stricter versions of their faith.</p><p>This is particularly true in the old mill towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire, which now contain parallel societies, where the faithful can live their day-to-day lives without mixing. Mosques run schools and pronounce on Islamic law. Restaurants offer gender segregation under the polite name of “family seating”.</p><p>These societies are dominated by a clerical class that extends its influence into secular society by, for example, endorsing candidates for Parliament. Mr Husain visited mosque after mosque that taught a highly literal interpretation of Islam, sometimes clinging to arguments that are being dropped in the Middle East. He saw shops displaying books that advocate stoning gays or keeping wives in purdah or waging jihad. Sayyid Qutb, Osama bin Laden’s favourite philosopher, appeared often.</p><p>Many of these clerics belong to religious groupings with roots far from these shores. Saudi Wahhabis pour money into British mosques and offer all-expenses-paid scholarships to young British Muslims. More surprising is the importance of the Deobandis. Mr Husain claims more than half of the country’s mosques now belong to the movement, which began in India and seeks to rebuild the caliphate from the ground up, convert by convert. Dewsbury, a historic market town in Yorkshire, is the European capital of the largest Muslim organisation in the world, the Tableeghi Jamaat, the movement’s evangelical arm.</p><p>Why does this matter? Religious minorities have always clung together, the better to preserve their faith. Look at the Quakers during the Industrial Revolution or Orthodox Jews in Manchester or London today. Isn’t “a parallel society” just a derogatory name for a flourishing subculture? And isn’t the Catholic church also an example of foreign influence? It is no business of the state to make windows into people’s souls.</p><p>There are nevertheless good reasons to be worried. One is the paradox of toleration. There are limits to how much liberal societies can tolerate people who call for gays to be stoned or who denounce Ms Shah as “a dog” because she fails to wear a hijab. The radicalised version of Islam being preached by clerics not only promotes intolerance but also fosters extremism.</p><p>A second is the paradox of diversity. The welfare state that liberals hold dear depends for its legitimacy on people feeling that they have a common identity. Robert Putnam, a Harvard sociologist, has demonstrated that support for the provision of public goods falls sharply if people think that the recipients are strikingly different from them. It is hard to be more strikingly different than the parallel communities of Dewsbury and Bradford.</p><p>State failure<br>The third is more practical. Britain is witnessing a struggle for the soul of Islam. But the state has repeatedly acted as if it is on the side of the forces of reaction rather than those of enlightenment. It has kowtowed to self-proclaimed community leaders, mistaking hardline beliefs for “authenticity”. It has tolerated schools such as Darul Uloom, in Rochdale, that combines gcse instruction with requiring students to memorise the Hadiths, including ones about beating wives and stoning homosexuals. And it has failed to make a compelling case for Britishness. Mr Husain points out that many Muslim children get a warts-and-all account of British history from their schools, while hearing constant praise for Turkey and Saudi Arabia in their madrassas. The trauma of Brexit has created a palpable desire to cure many of the social and geographic divisions that threaten to divide the country into warring tribes. Mr Husain makes a compelling case that that quest should not ignore the world of the mosque. </p><p><a id="international---a-backlash-against-gender-ideology-is-starting-in-universities"></a></p><h1 id="International-—A-backlash-against-gender-ideology-is-starting-in-universities"><a href="#International-—A-backlash-against-gender-ideology-is-starting-in-universities" class="headerlink" title="(International)—A backlash against gender ideology is starting in universities"></a>(International)—A backlash against gender ideology is starting in universities</h1><p>Academics are speaking up against the stifling of debate</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Hours before Jo Phoenix, a professor of criminology at Britain’s Open University, was due to give a talk at Essex University in the east of England about placing transgender women in women’s prisons, students threatened to barricade the hall. They complained that Ms Phoenix was a “transphobe” likely to engage in “hate speech”. A flyer with an image of a gun and text reading “shut the fuck up, terf” (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, a slur) was circulating. The university told Ms Phoenix it was postponing the event. Then the sociology department asked her for a copy of her talk. Days later it told her it had voted to rescind its invitation, and would issue no more. Ms Phoenix says she was “absolutely furious and deeply upset” about both the damage to her reputation and to academic freedom.</p><p>Essex University’s vice-chancellor asked Akua Reindorf, a lawyer who specialises in employment and discrimination law, to investigate. Eighteen months later, in mid-May, the university published Ms Reindorf’s report on its website. It said Essex had infringed Ms Phoenix’s right to freedom of expression and that its decision to “exclude and blacklist” her was also unlawful. It advised the university to apologise to Ms Phoenix and to Rosa Freedman, a professor of law at Reading University whom it had excluded from an event during Holocaust Memorial Week “because of her views on gender identity”. (Essex in the end allowed Ms Freedman to attend.)</p><p>Ms Reindorf’s report marks a challenge to the transgender dogma that originated on American campuses and has spread to universities around the English-speaking world. Its proponents hold that gender identity—the feeling that one is a man or a woman—is as important as biological sex and that trans people should in all circumstances be regarded as the gender with which they identify. This has increasingly influenced policy-makers: several places allow trans women into spaces that were once reserved for females, from sports teams to prisons and shelters for victims of domestic violence.</p><p>The opposing viewpoint, which is often described as “gender-critical”, might once have been considered mainstream. It argues that, since biological sex is unchangeable, even with hormones, surgery or any other form of treatment, the conviction that one has been born in the wrong body should not be dispositive. Gender critics argue that biological differences between the sexes make the continued provision of female-only spaces necessary. Trans activists say that trans women should have access to those places, too. “The emphasis that so-called gender-critical women place on what they describe as threats to women ignores the fact that trans women are overwhelmingly those who are threatened in single-sex spaces,” says Lisa Miracchi, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has signed open letters disapproving of gender-critical feminists.</p><p>The arguments the two sides put forward, in other words, are complex and debatable. But many trans activists think that any disagreement is tantamount to hate speech and try to suppress it. Some universities with policies that reflect the belief that trans women are women have acted on complaints about people who do nothing more than express a contrary view. In May, after students at Abertay University in Dundee reported that a student had said at a seminar that women have vaginas and men are stronger, the university launched an investigation.</p><p>In some cases, academics who have objected to “gender ideology”—the view that gender identity should trump biology—have been removed from professional posts. In April Callie Burt, an associate professor at Georgia State University, was fired from the editorial board of Feminist Criminology. She was told her presence might deter others from submitting manuscripts. The problem appears to have been her criticism of the conflation of sex and gender identity in proposed anti-discrimination legislation. Last June Kathleen Lowrey, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, was removed as the chair of an undergraduate programme after students complained they felt unsafe. She says she reckons gender-critical posters on her office door were to blame.</p><p>Yet the most worrying effect is likely to be invisible. An unknown number of university employees avoid expressing their opinion for fear it will damage their career or turn them into pariahs. The report about Essex says witnesses described a “culture of fear” among those with gender-critical views. This is unlikely to be limited to one university. The report also argues that expressing the view that trans women are not women is not hate speech and is not illegal under British law, whatever university policies might suggest.</p><p>The fight back<br>The report is likely to embolden gender-critical academics in Britain, at least, where they are already more outspoken. There are signs that a backlash to gender ideology is building elsewhere, too. In February, when Donna Hughes, a professor of women’s studies at Rhode Island University, published an article critical of gender ideology, petitions sprouted calling for her to be fired. Her university denounced her and warned that the right to free speech was “not boundless”. Ms Hughes, who is a co-founder of the Academic Freedom Alliance (afa), which was launched in March, says her university encouraged students to file complaints. She hired an “aggressive” lawyer. In May the afa announced the university had dropped its investigations into Ms Hughes and affirmed her right to speak.</p><p>Ms Hughes’s example is striking because in America, where concerns about free speech in universities tend to focus on racial sensitivities, gender-critical views are rarely expressed publicly. This is partly because there is no federal legislation that specifically protects trans (or gay) people from discrimination, which lends a particular urgency to lgbt activism. Jami Taylor, a professor of political science at the University of Toledo and a trans woman, says she has experienced “transgender-related bias” throughout her career, from being called “it” by students and a colleague to being guided to the men’s bathroom.</p><p>America’s political polarisation makes it harder yet to debate such topics. Trans activists often portray gender criticism as a far-right cause. Though it is becoming that, too, it is a topic on which leftist feminists and social conservatives find agreement. In Britain most outspoken gender-critical academics are left-leaning, atheist feminists. Some in America are, too.</p><p>Their chief concern is the preservation of female-only spaces. In February Holly Lawford-Smith, a professor of philosophy at the University of Melbourne, launched a website (noconflicttheysaid.org) which invited women to describe their experiences of sharing female-only spaces with trans women. It is not a research project and its reports are unverified. Most describe a feeling of discomfort rather than any form of physical assault. Soon afterwards, around 100 of her colleagues signed an open letter claiming the website promoted “harmful ideology”. It called for “swift and decisive action by the university”. Ms Lawford-Smith kept her job, but there have been at least two marches at the university decrying that. “I think people quite enjoy having a nemesis on campus,” she says.</p><p>How did an ideology that brooks no dissent become so entrenched in institutions supposedly dedicated to fostering independent thinking? Pressure groups have played a big part. In Britain most universities and many public-sector bodies have joined the Stonewall Diversity Champions scheme, which means they have drawn up policies that reflect the group’s position on trans identity. The report about Essex said the university’s policy “states the law as Stonewall would prefer it to be, rather than the law as it is”, and could cause the university to break the law by indirectly discriminating against women. Itrecommended that Essex reconsider its relationship with Stonewall. Several bodies, including the government’s equality watchdog, have since left the Champions scheme.</p><p>The influence of pressure groups exemplifies the other big reason trans ideology has gained a foothold in academia: its elision with the rights of gay people. Many organisations established to defend gay rights have morphed into trans-rights groups. Tamsin Blaxter, a research fellow at Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge and a trans woman, says that academia has become a lot more welcoming to trans people, thanks largely to Stonewall. But some gay people disagree with its new focus. In 2019 some supporters split from the group, in part owing to concerns that its stance encourages gay people to redefine themselves as trans (and straight), to form the lgb Alliance. Similar groups have sprung up around the world.</p><p>Students increasingly express gender-critical views. This year a group of feminist students in Cambridge ran a “replatforming” event for gender-critical scholars who had been excluded from academic events (Ms Phoenix was among the speakers). Sophie Watson, one of the organisers, says she has lost friends over the issue. “There’s so much fear over using the wrong language—to disagree with the line that trans women are women is really considered hateful,” she says.</p><p>Campus revolt<br>Gender-critical academics hope that as more of them speak out, others who share their concerns but were afraid to express them will feel emboldened. When Kathleen Stock, a professor of philosophy at Sussex University and one of Britain’s most prominent gender-critical academics, was given a government award for services to education last December, hundreds of academics from around the world signed an open letter denouncing her. More than 400 signed a counter letter in her defence. But many people, she says, prefer to express their support privately.</p><p>Universities will no doubt watch how the debate evolves outside academia, especially in the courts. The dangers of eroding free speech are becoming increasingly apparent as judges rule on matters from the medical treatment of trans-identifying children to people who have been sacked after being accused of transphobia. If Maya Forstater, a British researcher who lost her job because of her gender-critical views, wins her appeal against the ruling of an employment tribunal that this was lawful, universities may become quicker to defend their gender-critical employees.</p><p>Regulation may also play a part. In February the British government announced proposals to strengthen academic freedom at universities, including the appointment of a free-speech champion. Some (though not all) gender-critical academics welcome the idea. In America lawsuits invoking free speech may make a difference. But it would be better if universities, which owe their success to a tradition of dissent and debate, did in fact defend it. </p><p><a id="business---streaming-and-covid-19-have-entrenched-anime%E2%80%99s-global-popularity"></a></p><h1 id="Business-—Streaming-and-covid-19-have-entrenched-anime’s-global-popularity"><a href="#Business-—Streaming-and-covid-19-have-entrenched-anime’s-global-popularity" class="headerlink" title="(Business)—Streaming and covid-19 have entrenched anime’s global popularity"></a>(Business)—Streaming and covid-19 have entrenched anime’s global popularity</h1><p>Can the boom for Japanese cartoons last?</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>At first critics doubted that “Demon Slayer: Mugen Train”, which hit American cinemas in April, could replicate the success it achieved in its Japanese home market. The animated feature is set in early-20th-century Japan, an unrelatable era for non-Japanese viewers. Defying the odds, the film raked in $19.5m during its opening weekend, breaking America’s box-office record for a foreign-language debut.</p><p>For most of its history “anime” was little-known outside Japan. “Astro Boy”, a tv series from 1963 that sparked the first anime boom, and subsequent hits like “Doraemon” and “Gundam”, were watched mostly by otaku (geeks). Nerdy connotations limited their appeal at home. Titles that made it to the West from the 1970s also catered to niche audiences.</p><p>Now, gushes Muto Takashi, who runs Dentsu Japanimation Studio, “anime is no longer a subculture; it is a major culture.” In 2019 anime-related revenues from tv, streaming and gaming rights, live entertainment, cinema tickets and merchandise sales hit ¥2.5trn ($24bn). Just under half came from abroad, where the anime market has almost quintupled in size over the past decade. Figures for the pandemic year are scarce but are almost certainly higher. Netflix says that over 100m households around the world streamed at least one of its anime titles in 2020, 50% more than the year before. These featured in the streaming service’s daily top-ten list in nearly 100 countries last year.</p><p>Netflix and its rivals, such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, have exposed the global audience to an extensive library of Japanese anime. The pandemic, which put many live-action shoots on ice, further increased the appeal of anime to streamers. Anime films are also relatively cheap to make. Sudo Tadashi, an anime critic, estimates that an anime show on Netflix costs around ¥30m-50m ($275,000-459,000) per episode to make—a pittance next to the $13m reported for “The Crown”.</p><p>Netflix has acquired the rights to distribute 21 films produced by the renowned Studio Ghibli to about 190 countries (excluding America, Canada and, ironically, Japan). It is also creating its own animated content. In March the company said it would launch 40 new anime titles this year, nearly double the number released in 2020. It has also signed production agreements with nine anime studios. Last year Sony, an electronics group with a big entertainment arm, offered to pay $1.2bn for Crunchyroll, which began life peddling pirated anime content before going legal in 2009 and being bought in 2018 by at&amp;t, an American telecoms giant. Crunchyroll, which now boasts 100m registered anime aficionados around the world, is a rare example of a specialised David holding its own in a world dominated by generalist Goliaths like Netflix and Disney.</p><p>An obstacle to further growth may be flesh and blood. “The industry has struggled to nurture animators,” says Iwaki Ayaka of the Tokyo-based wit Studio. The dwindling domestic talent pool could have trouble meeting rising demand. Good news for the animators, whose historically miserly wages may edge up. For anime fans around the world, not so much. </p><p><a id="how-to-be-the-next-tesla"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-be-the-next-Tesla"><a href="#How-to-be-the-next-Tesla" class="headerlink" title="How to be the next Tesla"></a>How to be the next Tesla</h1><p>A traffic jam of upstarts is vying to follow in Elon Musk’s tyre tracks. Does any stand a chance?</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Carmaking is littered with defunct marques, from Diatto and Hupmobile to Mercer and Whitlock. America spawned around 250 firms by the 1910s. As the 20th century wound to a close it had three that mattered: Ford, General Motors (gm) and Chrysler. In the past few years an electric version of the early American automobile boom is unfolding on a global scale.</p><p>Chinese startups like Aiways, Li Auto, Nio, wm Motor and Xpeng are already making electric vehicles (evs) in their thousands. In Europe, Croatia’s Rimac and Spain’s Hispano Suiza are building hypercars, while Britain’s Arrival is manufacturing electric vans. American companies such as Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown, Lucid and Rivian hope to start full-scale production soon. Foxconn, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer better known for making Apple’s iPhones, may soon also be assembling electric cars for others. As for Apple, its next gadget could be an iCar.</p><p>Most of the insurgents are loss-making. Some have yet to earn any revenue. But all see a chance to grab a slice of an industry that has turned decisively in the direction of battery power (see chart 1). Everyone wants to be the next Tesla, which has successfully used batteries and clever software to take on the internal combustion engine. In the process Elon Musk’s firm has become the world’s most valuable car company, worth more than the next three biggest carmakers combined.</p><p>Tesla’s $600bn valuation serves as a “torch at the front”, says Engelbert Wimmer of e&amp;Co, a consultancy. Now investors are looking for the next beacon. Nio listed in New York in 2018. Xpeng and Li followed suit last year. All are worth as much or more than many established carmakers. Arrival and several of the American firms have used mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or spacs, as a shortcut to public markets—and to valuations in the billions. Patrick von Herz of Lincoln International, an investment bank, calls it a “global feeding frenzy”. He Xiaopeng, Xpeng’s boss, has said he expects the market to swell to 300 or so firms before settling at around ten. How do the challengers avoid the fate of the forgotten?</p><p>The basic blueprint for survival involves three elements. The upstarts must first find a starting niche from which they can expand. They then need actually to produce cars at scale. Finally, they have to create a sales-and-distribution network. Most will fail at one or more of these steps. Ironically, those with the best odds of emulating Tesla’s success may be the ones that look least like it.</p><p>Start with picking your battlefield. That could be geographic. Philippe Houchois of Jefferies, another investment bank, reckons that the next Tesla will come from China. Consumers hungry for new tech and a government keen to support electrification have given China’s insurgents a head-start. Nio, the largest of the lot, made 44,000 cars in 2020. It is valued at $69bn. The market capitalisations of Xpeng and Li, respectively $28bn and $22bn, are also juicy. Rich access to capital helps fund expansion at home and abroad. Xpeng has already started selling cars in Norway, home to Europe’s most enthusiastic ev buyers. Nio is about to join it.</p><p>Even more important than geography is choosing the right market segment. Tesla was not the first to make evs but it was the first to make big and pricey premium ones where the high cost of the battery could be absorbed. Many new firms are also aiming at premium suvs and saloons where profit margins are fattest. But competition is hotting up from established carmakers such as Volkswagen’s Audi and Porsche brands, as well as Mercedes. In April Geely, a Chinese firm with global ambitions, launched a premium electric marque called Zeekr. The mass market, meanwhile, is likewise busy, with gm and Ford the latest to announce a big electric push.</p><p>Other segments may therefore be a better bet. One is light commercial vehicles, demand for which has been boosted by the pandemic e-commerce boom. Alastair Hayfield of Interact Analysis, a consultancy, sees “no Tesla yet” for delivery vans. Carmakers are merely popping ev power trains into existing products—an unhappy compromise that affects performance. That leaves opportunities for firms like Arrival and Rivian. Another potentially lucrative niche is the hypercar. Wealthy petrol-heads seem willing to fork out $2m or so to add to their stables. Rimac and Pininfarina of Italy also see these cars as test-beds for ev technology to sell to other car firms. China’s Silk ev considers its Hongqi s9 hybrid as a gateway to the mass market.</p><p>Identifying the right segment may not be enough, however. Brian Gu, president of Xpeng, admits that the new firms must offer something truly different. For years the industry’s technologically stodgier incumbents “didn’t realise it was a tech race”, says Peter Rawlinson, who runs Lucid. As cars become more like personal electronic devices, being tech firms first and carmakers second may confer an advantage. Foxconn’s boss, Young Liu, has argued that the driving experience of the future will be “software-driven and software-defined”.</p><p>Novel intellectual property is a “good visiting card” for investors, says Pedro Pacheco of Gartner, a consultancy. But it is not enough to stick big touchscreens onto a standard electric power train, as many of the Chinese Tesla copycats are doing. The over-the-air software updates, proprietary charging networks and online direct sales pioneered by the American firm are now seen as table stakes.</p><p>So the newcomers are trying to stamp their own technological mark on the industry. Lucid’s techies have extracted range of up to 517 miles (832km) from its batteries. Nio offers a three-minute battery-swap service, to reassure Chinese buyers without access to home charging. Xpeng claims that its voice-activation system is the best in the business. Fisker and Canoo offer subscriptions that give motorists access to car use rather than ownership.</p><p>Ultimately, buyers will decide which of these are desirable features and which are gimmicks. But not before the new models are produced and sold. Making a few thousand cars a year is hard enough (though losing money doing so is easy). Actually selling hundreds of thousands at a profit is another matter entirely. “Production hell” nearly sent Tesla under. A lead on flashy software must be backed up with giant presses, paint shops and assembly lines. As such, manufacturing an ev is in many ways not much different to making a petrol car, according to Bernstein, a broker—and no less expensive. A new purpose-built car factory that can churn out 100,000 or so vehicles a year costs at least $1bn.</p><p>To get around this problem some of the challengers are instead repurposing existing factories, as Tesla did by acquiring a disused one in Fremont, California, for a song. Rivian has moved into an old Mitsubishi factory in Illinois. Other newcomers are teaming up with the old guard, with experience of maintaining long and complex supply chains. Baidu has entered into a partnership with Geely and Huawei with its domestic rivals, baic, Changan and gac. Fisker and Nio are taking an asset-light route by using contract manufacturers of the sort used by big carmakers to make small runs of cars or those with finicky features such as folding roofs.</p><p>Arrival’s approach may be the most innovative. Where Tesla and others are going “giga”, the British firm says “micro”. Commercial vehicles do not require the styling or customisation of passenger cars, so it is eschewing production lines for “cell” assembly of composite panels. This can be done in small industrial units that cost just $40m-50m to buy and retool. These can produce 10,000 vehicles a year close to markets, adding scale with less risk.</p><p>The final hurdle is flogging the vehicles to consumers. The new ev-makers are mostly dispensing with traditional dealer networks in favour of Tesla’s model of online sales backed up with shops to show off their wares. That still leaves the challenge of creating a servicing network if anything goes wrong. Such networks, which car buyers have come to expect, can be as expensive and tricky to scale up as manufacturing is. Mr Pacheco of Gartner notes that even Tesla’s is still a work in progress. In America the big three Detroit carmakers have nearly 10,000 dealerships that will service cars; Tesla has around 135.</p><p>Many new firms won’t get that far. Several have already suffered setbacks. Dyson, a British firm better known for vacuum-cleaners, sank £500m ($640m) into an ev effort only to conclude in 2019 that it would never make money. The same year Nio teetered on the brink of bankruptcy until the local government in its home city of Hefei bailed it out. A bloodbath awaits China’s myriad smaller ev firms as they run out of ideas and money. Fisker is a reborn version of a firm that went bankrupt in 2013.</p><p>Attention, vehicles reversing<br>As the complicated reality of carmaking sets in, the hype is wearing off among investors (see chart 2). Lordstown’s value has fallen by 65% since peaking in February, after it lowered forecast production for its pickup truck and said it needed fresh funds. Canoo’s shares are worth less than half what they were when it went public in December, owing to growing doubts about its business plan.</p><p>In short, notes Aakash Arora of bcg, a consultancy, the new firms need to establish brands. So far, he says, only Tesla has done so. It can take years to gain a reputation for reliable products, while capital burns like petrol put to a spark. A new entrant needs a trusted name, deep pockets and a proven ability to come up with clever tech. One company that has all those in spades is Apple. The iPhone-maker has been working on an ev for several years. The latest chatter is that it will have one in production by the middle of the decade. Some of its potential competitors will by then be well on the way to oblivion.</p><p><a id="why-the-bullshit-jobs-thesis-may-be-well-bullshit"></a></p><h1 id="Why-the-bullshit-jobs-thesis-may-be-well-bullshit"><a href="#Why-the-bullshit-jobs-thesis-may-be-well-bullshit" class="headerlink" title="Why the bullshit-jobs thesis may be, well, bullshit"></a>Why the bullshit-jobs thesis may be, well, bullshit</h1><p>David Graeber’s theory isn’t borne out by the evidence</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Most people feel, from time to time, that their work is meaningless. David Graeber, the late anthropologist, built an elaborate thesis out of this insight. He argued in a book in 2018 that society has been deliberately creating more and more “bullshit jobs” in professions such as financial services to fill the time of educated workers who need the money to pay off student debts but who suffer from depression because of their work. His thesis has been cited more than 800 times by academics, according to Google Scholar, and often repeated in the media.</p><p>When the book came out, this columnist was unimpressed, arguing that the thesis was a partial reworking of the insights of C. Northcote Parkinson, who argued that bureaucracy has an innate tendency to expand and make work for itself. Three academics—Magdalena Soffia, Alex Wood and Brendan Burchell—have undertaken a systematic analysis* of the claims behind Mr Graeber’s work and found that the data often show the exact opposite of what he predicted. The bullshit-jobs thesis, in other words, is largely bullshit.</p><p>In his book, Mr Graeber relied heavily on surveys of British and Dutch workers that asked participants whether their job made a meaningful contribution to the world. This seems a high bar to clear; it is unsurprising that 37-40% of respondents thought their job didn’t qualify. By contrast, the academics used the European Working Conditions Surveys, which by 2015 had talked to 44,000 workers across 35 countries. They focused on those respondents who thought that the statement “I have the feeling of doing useful work” applied to them “rarely” or “never”.</p><p>In contrast to the high share of bullshit jobs reported by Mr Graeber, in 2015 only 4.8% of respondents in the eu felt their work was useless. And this proportion had fallen, not risen, in recent years, from 5.5% in 2010 and 7.8% in 2005.</p><p>Furthermore, those who work in clerical and administrative jobs are far less likely to view their jobs as useless than those who are employed in roles that Mr Graeber regarded as essential, such as refuse collection and cleaning. Indeed, the researchers found an inverse relationship between education and the feeling of usefulness. Less educated workers were likelier to feel that their jobs were useless. And student debt does not appear to be a factor. In Britain, where its level is the highest in Europe, non-graduates under 29 were twice as likely to feel useless as their indebted graduate peers.</p><p>So what is really going on? Part of the problem, surely, is the prejudice felt by academics like Mr Graeber towards those who work in finance or other capitalist occupations, and a resentment that such people earn so much more than those who work in the caring professions or manual labour. To be fair, Bartleby has met many a financier and businessman who is prejudiced in the other direction—believing that academics and those in other “dilettante” jobs (like journalism) are living off the wealth that capitalists generate. Another factor is the human tendency to adopt the culture of their profession; those who sell assault rifles or homeopathic medicines eventually come to believe they are doing good work.</p><p>But part of Mr Graeber’s thesis turns out to be correct. Employees who think their work is useless tend to feel anxious and depressed. The reason, the academics suggest, is linked to the Marxist idea of “alienation”, which described what artisans felt in the 19th century when they stopped working for themselves and were dragooned into factories.</p><p>Alienation depends on how the workers are treated by those in charge. “If managers are respectful, supportive and listen to workers, and if workers have the opportunities for participation, to use their own ideas and have time to do a good job, they are less likely to feel that their work is useless,” the researchers write. Workers are likelier to feel useless when they lack the chance to use their skills or display autonomy. This problem more often bedevils those in low-paid work than graduates in the professions.</p><p>In essence, this is a restatement of the old adage that “people don’t leave bad jobs, they leave bad managers.” It is a backhanded compliment to managers that less than 5% of workers feel their efforts are useless. You need not envision an elaborate conspiracy to explain why people occasionally find their jobs boring or dispiriting. That’s life.</p><p><a id="america-both-helps-and-hinders-china%E2%80%99s-military-industrial-complex"></a></p><h1 id="America-both-helps-and-hinders-China’s-military-industrial-complex"><a href="#America-both-helps-and-hinders-China’s-military-industrial-complex" class="headerlink" title="America both helps and hinders China’s military-industrial complex"></a>America both helps and hinders China’s military-industrial complex</h1><p>Domestic demand for weapons is up. But American sanctions may hobble Chinese armsmakers’ tech ambitions</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Jianghang aircraft equipment has struggled to tantalise investors with the fuel systems and detachable petrol tanks it builds for Chinese warplanes. The company, controlled by Aviation Industry Corporation of China (avic), the country’s biggest aerospace-and-defence conglomerate, had witnessed its share price slump by 50% since it went public in Shanghai last year. But in the first three months of the year demand for its wares has soared. On May 28th Jianghang said that net profit for the period nearly doubled, year on year. Trading in its shares subsequently had to be halted after their price rose by 10%, the maximum permitted one-day swing.</p><p>Jianghang is just one of dozens of military-linked companies on a high. Most are not publicly traded and disclose little financial information. State-owned builders of navy vessels have flotillas of listed subsidiaries. avic, the main group behind China’s fighter-jet programme with more than 1trn yuan ($157bn) in total assets, has 24 publicly traded divisions. To get a sense of the industry analysts track dozens of small military stocks. Citic Securities, an investment bank, covers 58. Everbright, a state-owned broker, follows 115.</p><p>The total weapons sales of China’s four biggest firms that make them—of which avic is the largest—have been flat at just over $50bn since at least 2015, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (sipri), a think-tank, even as those of foreign rivals have grown. But if the listed divisions are a guide, things may be looking up for the sector.</p><p>The combined operating income of firms followed by Everbright rose by 11% last year, to 475bn yuan. Citic reckons that net profits for the industry’s listed contingent grew by about 50% in 2020. As China’s economy boomed in the first quarter, especially compared with last year’s harsh covid-19 lockdowns, only agribusiness and miners of non-ferrous metals notched up faster year-on-year revenue growth than China’s military-industrial complex.</p><p>The main reason for this armsmaking bonanza is China’s increasingly chilly relationship with America. One note to investors from Huaxi Securities, a broker, was embellished with an image of two fists, draped in opposing American and Chinese flags, flying towards each other. America’s attempts to “lock China out of technological advancement”, Huaxi analysts say, is spurring new growth. Citic talks of “a period of volatility not experienced in 100 years” and predicts “a rare period of rapid development” in China’s military-industrial enterprise as a result. sipri noted in December that Chinese arms groups were benefiting from a programme aimed at modernising its armed forces.</p><p>The domestic market is becoming increasingly important for Chinese weapons companies. According to sipri, China’s arms exports declined by 8% between 2016 and 2020. At the same time, those of America, France and Germany grew. Chinese drones may be cheaper than Western ones but they are also seen as less capable.</p><p>Fusion firepower<br>In an effort to change that state of affairs, and bolster domestic armsmakers in the process, Chinese officials talk up “military-civilian fusion”. This long-standing project aims to bring cutting-edge civilian technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors into military supply chains, in keeping with the Communist Party slogan that “civilians and troops are members of the same household.” The idea’s manifestations include Hikvision, a state-owned maker of surveillance kit, which made 2.2bn yuan in net profit in the first quarter, up by 45% from a year earlier.</p><p>Ironic, then, that the same Sino-American tensions that are boosting Chinese armsmakers may end up undermining this strategy. The idea of civilian-military fusion spooked Donald Trump’s administration and prompted it to bar American firms from supplying companies like Huawei, a giant maker of telecoms gear that is perceived as being close to the People’s Liberation Army (pla). The result has been disastrous for Huawei. Its revenues fell for the second consecutive quarter earlier this year. It is struggling to procure chips and more Western countries are shunning its 5g mobile networks.</p><p>Blacklisting by America may also deprive some defence-adjacent Chinese firms of a source of capital. Foreign ownership of military-linked stocks was thought to be low. It may soon be non-existent. Since January American investors have been barred from owning shares in China Spacesat, a state-owned Fortune 500 firm that helps run the country’s space programme. The same month Fidelity Investments, an American asset manager, confirmed to its clients that it would sell some securities as a result of sanctions.</p><p>Mr Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, shows little intention of easing the restrictions. On June 3rd he tightened some of them once again on firms with ties to surveillance and defence groups. A recent paper from the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank, noted that the Chinese leadership’s continued obsession with military-civil fusion reflects concerns that reforms to bring it about “have not progressed rapidly enough”. American military strategists would love it if China’s efforts to speed things along had the opposite effect. </p><p><a id="the-big-pharma-firm-that-saw-the-future"></a></p><h1 id="The-big-pharma-firm-that-saw-the-future"><a href="#The-big-pharma-firm-that-saw-the-future" class="headerlink" title="The big-pharma firm that saw the future"></a>The big-pharma firm that saw the future</h1><p>Long ago Roche bet on personalised health care. Now its time has come</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Roche is a strange entity. The Swiss giant is the world’s second-biggest drugmaker and one of big pharma’s most profitable firms. But its largest shareholding group, mostly descended from Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, who founded the company in 1896, is led by André Hoffmann, a nature lover and sustainability advocate who believes that the purpose of business is not mainly to make money. Even its bosses are discouraged from making a quick franc. Severin Schwan, an Austrian who has led the company since 2008, is only Roche’s seventh ceo in 125 years. Much of his pay is tied up in company stock for ten years, giving him, as he puts it, “literally a vested interest” in its long-term future.</p><p>Another thing sets Roche apart from the crowd. For two decades it has nurtured an unflashy diagnostics division alongside its mainstay of drug production, in an effort to create more personalised health care. This unit, which accounts for almost a quarter of sales, has generated lower margins than pharmaceuticals, and puts off the sort of investors who yearn only for blockbuster medicines. Had it not been for the Hoffmanns’ patience, some suspect, activists would have forced Roche to sell it or spin it off long ago.</p><p>And yet in the past year or so the ability to diagnose a disease in its early stages has fully come into its own. The division has helped the company through the covid-19 pandemic. Roche was not one of the star vaccine producers, but its workaday pcr and antigen tests bolstered profits despite a slowdown in cancer treatments, its biggest business. Moreover, advances in gene sequencing and other techniques from molecular biology helped identify sars-cov-2, the covid-19 virus, as well as ways to fight it. That has highlighted the value of combining biotechnology and diagnostics. These are both fields in which Roche excels.</p><p>Far from shedding diagnostics, Roche is now doubling down on it, expanding into digitisation and advanced data analytics to create individually tailored cancer treatments. This is, says Tim Haines, boss of Abingworth, a biotech venture-capital firm, “the golden age of diagnostics”. Bets placed years ago are making the stodgy-sounding, Basel-based company look prescient.</p><p>Mr Schwan, whose background is in diagnostics, can barely contain his excitement. After a long conversation with The Economist, he came back for more a day later. As he explains, cancer is a panoply of diseases based on individual mutations. Diagnostics identifies genetic and other differences between patients, leading to the creation of more personalised treatments. The tailor-made market, by definition, is smaller than the one for blockbuster drugs, but if patients respond better to treatment, the value of drugs can be proportionally higher. Sifting through oceans of genomic data can produce yet more precision.</p><p>Accumulating reams of information on patients has long sat awkwardly with concerns about medical privacy. Less so now, Mr Schwan believes. He says the pandemic has helped change the mood in two ways. First, the use of data-crunching to speed up the fight against covid-19 has made health authorities, hospitals and doctors more amenable to the idea of sharing medical records—provided the information is anonymised. This is, after all, biotech, not big tech. “We are not in the advertising business,” he says. Second, regulators have shown what he describes as an “incredible” willingness to speed up drug approval by gaining access to clinical-trial data in real time. “Why should we not do the same for life-saving cancer medicines?”</p><p>Roche, which has recently fallen behind Merck, an oncology rival, in immunotherapy treatments, has been eagerly waiting for this digital tide to turn. Two American acquisitions in 2018 could prove particularly fruitful. One is Foundation Medicine, a gene-sequencing company that can identify cancers from dna in blood samples, instead of from tumour biopsies. The other is Flatiron Health, a specialist in cancer-related health records that generates data on patients from the real world, supplementing clinical trials. Both produce what Roche calls insights on cancer. Like its diagnostics business, not only do they help it further its own drug development; they also sell services to rivals, making them businesses in their own right. They are not yet profitable, but one day, Mr Schwan says, the “insights” business could be a third pillar for Roche—as big, if not bigger, than diagnostics and pharma.</p><p>There are potential pitfalls. Biology is as messy and unpredictable as nature itself. Data analytics may not be as useful in biotech as in other industries. Roche will not have the field to itself. Silicon Valley tech giants are already muscling in. And Europe, where Roche is based, has long been squeamish about data-gathering and privacy. If that continues to apply to medicine, it will hobble the region’s health-care industry.</p><p>That said, Roche has a record of pulling off the unexpected. Stefan Schneider of Vontobel, a Swiss investment firm, notes that it has accomplished the rare feat of keeping profits ticking over even as patents on its three biggest cancer drugs, which had peak annual revenues of $21bn, have expired. Its immunotherapy drug, Tecentriq, has recently shown promising results in early-stage lung-cancer care, which may be a big breakthrough. And it has mastered the art of buying trendy biotech firms without spoiling their innovative fizz.</p><p>Black Schwan<br>Indeed, its success vindicates long-term thinking and shows that shareholders’ focus on notions like sustainability can co-exist with commercial success. For all the Hoffmann family’s influence, Mr Schwan is no softy. He defends high drug prices in America. He believes in strong intellectual-property protection. When America’s government this year threw its support behind patent waivers for covid-19 vaccines, he compared it to communist East Germany’s nationalisation of drugmakers. Roche may be unusual. As one of Europe’s few world-class megafirms, it is ballsy, too. </p>]]></content>

Yet when “Joseon Exorcist’‘ hit South Korean screens earlier this year, it provoked apoplexy on social media. The show was historically inaccurate, fumed pedants. Not because it showed ancient Korean royals battling the undead, but because it showed them enjoying Chinese snacks, such as mooncakes and preserved eggs. Companies pulled their advertising. The show was taken off the air after just two episodes.</p><p>The incident is just one in a series of recent rows. In the past few months South Koreans have repeatedly taken to social media to rail against the “excessive” presence of Chinese brands on domestic television, forcing actors and broadcasters to apologise. They are even more outraged when Chinese state media, diplomats and social-media users suggest that important parts of Korea’s cultural heritage such as kimchi (fermented cabbage), samgyetang (chicken soup with ginseng) or hanbok (a traditional form of dress) are in fact Chinese. In April nearly 700,000 Koreans signed a petition asking the government not to “give our land to China” by permitting a China-themed cultural park and hotel in the north-eastern province of Gangwon. In response, the (Korean) developers called off the project.</p><p>These arguments are the latest version of an old clash of competing nationalisms. South Koreans are painfully aware of their country’s history as a tributary to Chinese empires, and of how Chinese troops slaughtered South Koreans during the Korean war to save the despotic regime in the North. They are proud of their country’s modernity, wealth and democracy. Many look down on China as poor, autocratic and altogether less sophisticated, while also resenting how important its vast markets are to South Korea’s own economic success. By contrast, Chinese sometimes view South Korea as a haughty minnow that derives its culture from its bigger neighbour, and that must occasionally be put in its place. “Koreans believe our culture is unique and was never dependent on China, whereas China thinks Korea only has a culture thanks to China,” says Lee Moon-ki of Sejong University in Seoul.</p><p>The tensions arising from such different interpretations of history—and the thin-skinned reactions to them—have surfaced periodically, ever since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992. A Chinese memorial to soldiers who died in the Korean war was the source of a big row in the 1990s. Ten years later there was another noisy quarrel over Chinese research into an ancient kingdom that once straddled what is now the border between China and North Korea. South Koreans saw it as an effort to reframe the history of their peninsula. The two countries appear to be sliding into another prolonged bout of mudslinging, this time intensified by social media.</p><p>South Koreans blame the bad blood on increasingly assertive nationalism in China. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, “keeps talking about the Chinese Dream, about rediscovering past glories after 100 years of pain,” says Mr Lee. Nationalist rhetoric from officials encourages ordinary Chinese to echo inflammatory claims, such as that China invented kimchi, reckons Min Kwi-sik of Hanyang University in Seoul. The combination of official needling and provocations by ordinary people riles Koreans. “It’s a sense of: they used to take our land, now they take our kimchi,” he says. And the viral, engagement-driven mechanism of social media tends to amplify the loudest, angriest voices, even if they belong to only a small minority. “The internet is a great place to spread conflict and bury solutions,” says Mr Min.</p><p>Still, the social-media spats reflect a deepening dislike of China. In two separate opinion polls conducted this spring, Koreans were about as favourably inclined towards China as to North Korea (with which they are technically still at war) and only barely more so than towards Japan, Korea’s former colonial oppressor. Opinions of China were better as recently as 2019, suggesting that the pandemic may have coloured views. But the real turning-point, says Kim Ji-yoon, an analyst in Seoul who specialises in polling, was an economic boycott launched by China in 2017 in response to South Korea’s deployment of an American missile-defence system known as thaad. Shin Gi-wook of Stanford University agrees: “It was a bit of a rude awakening, alerting South Korea to the fact that China was an aggressive power.”</p><p>Young people take a particularly dim view of China, especially when compared with other neighbours and America. “I know that eating mala soup or going to shops run by Chinese-Koreans will benefit the Chinese Communist Party eventually,” says Kim Woo-jin, a 25-year-old from Seoul. Ms Kim, the polling analyst, is not surprised. Young people “don’t know as much about China as about, say, America, so they make fewer distinctions between the country, the people and the government,” she says.</p><p>The discontent is, for now, limited to the low-stakes cultural realms of food and television. Popular views of China have little bearing on the South Korean government’s carefully calibrated diplomacy, casting China as an important strategic partner while stressing the centrality of the security alliance with America. Even Chinese officials have made the occasional conciliatory noise about the origins of kimchi. Chinese shop-owners and restaurateurs in Seoul report no signs of a boycott like the one that hit Japanese brands and noodle joints during a spat two years ago.</p><p>However, during a meeting with President Joe Biden in Washington on May 21st, Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, was unusually explicit in his commitment to an American agenda aimed at containing Chinese influence. It is in everyone’s interest to keep the kimchi wars cold.</p><p><a id="india-plans-to-remake-lakshadweep-for-tourism"></a></p><h1 id="India-plans-to-remake-Lakshadweep-for-tourism"><a href="#India-plans-to-remake-Lakshadweep-for-tourism" class="headerlink" title="India plans to remake Lakshadweep for tourism"></a>India plans to remake Lakshadweep for tourism</h1><p>Whether locals want it or not</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The brochure writes itself: a scattering of coral ringlets, each encircling its own turquoise lagoon within the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep is India at its most alluring. These 36 islands, together totalling just 32 square kilometres of land, are peopled by a matrilineal, mostly Muslim society where families make their living through seafaring and coconut harvests.</p><p>In the past fortnight this drop in the Indian bucket, just 70,000 people among 1.4bn, has come to exemplify a sort of controversy that is becoming incessant. The national government of Narendra Modi and his Hindu-first Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp) is flexing little-tested executive muscles to push through a package of reforms for the far-off islands. They would open up the archipelago to development, of tourism in particular. Locals are dismayed.</p><p>In theory “union territories” such as Lakshadweep are protected from some of the vagaries of electoral politics, since they are not part of any state. But that leaves the central government with sweeping power over them, which it increasingly employs, as Delhi and Jammu &amp; Kashmir have lately discovered. Lakshadweep has an administrator—in effect, picked by the prime minister—who may rule without regard for local opinion. These days, that is just what he is doing.</p><p>Before the latest administrator, Praful K. Patel, arrived in December, the job had been held by career bureaucrats. Mr Patel is a politician, a bjp man from Mr Modi’s home state, Gujarat, where he was home minister. As administrator of Daman, a former Portuguese enclave north of Mumbai, he enraged tribal fishermen by demolishing 90 homes along a stretch of beach seized for development. Lakshadweep is even riper for such schemes.</p><p>Earlier this year Mr Patel published a slew of far-reaching draft laws that would give the administrator the right to acquire any land for “a public purpose”. Other changes are striking given that 97% of the people of Lakshadweep are Muslim. Mr Patel would ban the sale of beef and expand liquor permits, the better to attract tourists from the rest of India. A Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, modelled after a similar law in Gujarat, would allow locals to be jailed without a hearing for up to a year—supposedly necessary because smugglers have been caught in Lakshadweep’s waters. Sundry rules would displace a traditional port, replace local dairy with imports (from Gujarat) and disqualify politicians with more than two children from contesting local elections.</p><p>Some of the proposed changes are worthy of debate. Many in Lakshadweep are interested in fostering tourism. Few, however, seem to like Mr Patel’s plans to do so. Lakshadweep’s sole member of parliament, Mohammed Faizal, says that the most incendiary proposals, concerning liquor and beef, are diversions. Seizing land is the power the government really intends to exercise, he reckons.</p><p>On mainland India, the debate about Lakshadweep has tended to skirt the question of locals’ wishes. A spokeswoman for the bjp explained how, “with proper planning, Lakshadweep can thrive and become the jewel in India’s crown!” This is odd language to hear 74 years after India extricated itself from another country’s crown. </p><p><a id="india%E2%80%99s-government-goes-after-twitter-and-its-ilk"></a></p><h1 id="India’s-government-goes-after-Twitter-and-its-ilk"><a href="#India’s-government-goes-after-Twitter-and-its-ilk" class="headerlink" title="India’s government goes after Twitter and its ilk"></a>India’s government goes after Twitter and its ilk</h1><p>But it is unclear whether it is protecting citizens or its own interests</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>With his 68.7m Twitter followers Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, nestles comfortably between the American celebrities Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian in rankings of popularity on the service. This is not by accident. Mr Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party (bjp) have been early and avid exploiters of social media. Whether to lure new members to join the 180m who already make it the world’s biggest political party, to hustle donations or amplify attacks on its critics, the bjp has relied on internet platforms to reshape India’s politics.</p><p>But with Mr Modi’s popularity tumbling in recent months, his government is turning against these useful messengers. At the end of May it began enforcing new rules that, among other things, make internet-based conduits of information, such as Twitter and Facebook, legally liable for any content that they carry, oblige them to respond promptly to official demands to block sites the government deems bad, and will force messaging services, such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, to break the encryption that guarantees privacy to their users. The rules also extend government oversight of digital news platforms and streaming services, such as Netflix.</p><p>A first shot across the bows came on May 24th, when police arrived in force at Twitter’s offices in Delhi and Gurgaon, a satellite city, to serve a legal notice regarding the firm’s decision to mark some posts as “manipulated media”—part of Twitter’s global efforts to identify blatant misinformation. The labels were added in response to investigations that showed bjp officials to be the source of tweets about a so-called media “toolkit” laying out how to attack the government’s handling of the pandemic. The offending tweets alleged that the “toolkit” (which was later exposed as fake) had been created by the rival Congress party. But rather than investigate the political smear campaign, the government demanded that Twitter remove its tags.</p><p>Twitter’s response, proclaiming its commitment to free speech within ethical bounds, and expressing concern for the safety of its employees, seems to have enraged the government further. The ministry of information technology accused the American firm of attempting to “dictate terms to the world’s largest democracy”. It said that Twitter routinely turned a blind eye to content hostile to India, such as use of the term “Indian variant” to describe a nasty mutation of the coronavirus. The onus to protect Indians’ freedoms lies with their elected government, not foreign tech firms, thundered Bhupender Yadav, a top bjp official, in an opinion column.</p><p>Mr Yadav has a point. No country has yet satisfactorily answered the question of how to regulate online content. It makes sense, at a minimum, for big multinationals to face some degree of local scrutiny and accountability. Yet India’s tangle of laws and slow and capricious courts make the task of moderation infinitely complicated. In the absence of universal rules and standards, or of handing Chinese-style censorship powers to a single agency, it must rely largely on trust.</p><p>The trouble is that while India’s new rules make it clear that the government no longer trusts internet firms to police themselves, its own behaviour brings into question whether ordinary Indian citizens can trust their government to protect their freedoms. With dismaying frequency Mr Modi’s men have used the institutions they control to target and punish not people who represent any clear threat to India, but rather the bjp’s own critics and opponents.</p><p>Companies affected by the new rules are trying various tactics. Google is seeking exemption on grounds that it acts more like a utility than a content manager. Twitter has partly complied, by appointing an interim “grievance officer” to address complaints. Other firms, including WhatsApp, have sent in the lawyers: at least seven lawsuits are currently being heard in Indian courts. But don’t hold your breath. Judges know that those who give rulings favourable to Mr Modi seem mysteriously to be rewarded with plump post-retirement sinecures. The internet is a marvel, but older ways of communicating still work, too.</p><p><a id="indonesia-adds-another-weapon-to-its-speech-suppressing-arsenal"></a></p><h1 id="Indonesia-adds-another-weapon-to-its-speech-suppressing-arsenal"><a href="#Indonesia-adds-another-weapon-to-its-speech-suppressing-arsenal" class="headerlink" title="Indonesia adds another weapon to its speech-suppressing arsenal"></a>Indonesia adds another weapon to its speech-suppressing arsenal</h1><p>A worrying new internet law from South-East Asia’s biggest democracy</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>After a slow start, citizens of South-East Asian countries have in recent years taken to the internet with gusto, using it, like their counterparts everywhere else, to shop, to chat with their friends, to watch movies and to listen to music—and to criticise their governments. And as in many parts of the world, governments have found that they do not much like that last feature of this whole internet thing.</p><p>In response, many simply charge troublesome individuals using laws against age-old offences like treason, blasphemy and sedition. More thorough legislatures, such as Singapore’s, have passed new laws prohibiting “fake news”. Some governments are even more heavy-handed. Myanmar has lately been choking off access to the internet. Cambodia plans to set up a government-controlled “gateway” through which all internet traffic must pass, the better to inspect it for wrongthink. They are in the vanguard. Asian countries are “leading the way on digital censorship”, says Linda Lakhdhir of Human Rights Watch, a pressure group.</p><p>As South-East Asia’s most robust democracy, Indonesia might have been expected to buck this trend. But under President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, who has been in power since 2014, many senior officials have succumbed to what Ben Bland, the president’s biographer, calls “knee-jerk authoritarianism”. A law passed in 2008, ostensibly to protect digital consumers, is commonly used to silence critics of the government. In 2019 authorities throttled the internet in Jakarta in response to riots ginned up by a defeated presidential candidate, and in Papua, a region racked by separatism, when violent protests broke out there. The government is also fond of trying to scrub the internet clean of content it dislikes. The communications ministry frequently orders internet service providers to block websites it deems false or indecent.</p><p>The latest weapon in Indonesia’s speech-suppressing arsenal is Ministerial Regulation no. 5 ( mr5), a new decree that requires internet platforms to remove prohibited content, defined as anything that violates Indonesian law, incites unrest or disturbs public order, within as little as four hours. The government says it is intended to “preserve and protect the country”. Many suspect it is designed chiefly to preserve and protect the government.</p><p>The law requires “private-sector electronic-service operators”, such as social-media platforms, search engines and financial, cloud-computing and data-processing services, to register with the government and to provide sensitive information. When the communications ministry issues a take-down notice, firms must comply within 24 hours—or four hours in the case of child pornography, material promoting terrorism or “content which disturbs society”. Penalties for firms which fail to comply include large fines and having their services blocked.</p><p>Critics say the law is vague and poorly worded, making it ripe for misuse. Online journalism websites, for example, could count as “private-sector electronic-system operators”. “Prohibited content” could include anything that would provide access to such content. Merely using a virtual private network—to log into an secure work network, for example—might become illegal.</p><p>Another concern is the requirement that companies provide law-enforcement agencies with “direct access” to their systems and data. What precisely that means is unclear, but it would expose platforms to all sorts of legal and business risks, according to the Asia Internet Coalition, which represents big international tech companies. It would also raise serious privacy concerns. The government insists that it respects the right to privacy and freedom of expression. Indeed it has postponed by six months the original deadline of June 2nd for companies to register. Citizens, firms and its less democratic neighbours will be watching to see which way it goes. </p><p><a id="the-impulse-behind-japan%E2%80%99s-decision-to-go-on-with-the-olympic-games"></a></p><h1 id="The-impulse-behind-Japan’s-decision-to-go-on-with-the-Olympic-games"><a href="#The-impulse-behind-Japan’s-decision-to-go-on-with-the-Olympic-games" class="headerlink" title="The impulse behind Japan’s decision to go on with the Olympic games"></a>The impulse behind Japan’s decision to go on with the Olympic games</h1><p>Nationalism explains what rationality cannot</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Fewer than 50 days remain before the apparently unstoppable opening of the 2020 summer Olympic games in Tokyo. The pandemic led to their postponement last year. Today the clock is ticking down against a backdrop of resurgent infections of covid-19 in Japan, a state of emergency in Tokyo and nine other prefectures, hospitals filling up and widespread opposition to the games from the public, businessfolk and medical experts.</p><p>All this counts for little in the eyes of the government and the International Olympic Committee ( ioc). The games are a go “barring Armageddon”, as one ioc member unhelpfully put it. Yet Armageddon is the real fear. The pace of vaccination in Japan has been snail-slow. Many foreign athletes will arrive unjabbed. The games risk going down in history as a massive superspreader event.</p><p>One reason for Japan’s obduracy lies in its contractual obligations to the ioc. Another is the personal concern of the prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, not to lose face—and possibly support within the ruling party. But the establishment’s sense of the Olympic games as serving a patriotic purpose should not be underestimated. Tokyo’s Olympics were intended to banish a sense of being overtaken—“Japan passing”, in the anglicised phrase—by a rising China and others following years of stagnation and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Bad enough was 2020 passing. The games’ total abandonment, in the herd thinking of the establishment, does not count as a blow for common sense. Rather, it could shatter the very notion that, as Mr Suga’s predecessor put it, “Japan is back.”</p><p>The country has been somewhere near here before. In the 1930s Japan lobbied hard to host the 1940 Olympic games in Tokyo. It was to be Japan’s moment to establish itself as a first-rate power. But like the pandemic today, war—Japan’s own invasion of China in 1937 and a looming global conflict—overshadowed everything. The games were cancelled.</p><p>Japan’s military adventurism contributed to the cancellation. Yet seeking to put a gloss on things, Kido Koichi, an adviser to Emperor Hirohito, declared that when peace reigned again, Tokyo would be ready to host the games and show the people of the world “the true Japanese spirit”. After the war, Kido was condemned as a war criminal, but Tokyo was true to his word. In 1964 it put on a splendid games, which served as a modern, democratic coming-out party for Japan.</p><p>Ever since, Asia’s hostings of the summer games have carried a broader significance for the host nation and even its neighbours. The 1988 games in Seoul, the South Korean capital, were a catalyst for democracy, helping to end decades of authoritarian rule. China’s communist leaders represented the Beijing games in 2008 as a return to historical greatness. In 2022 Beijing hosts the winter Olympics, as the Japanese government is all too aware. As Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo points out, not holding the games would hand a propaganda coup to China.</p><p>Yet such grand narratives, coupled with the region’s brittle nationalisms, can rub up against each other. Some South Koreans, led by two former prime ministers, are calling for their country to boycott the Tokyo games. At issue is a speck that appears on the official online map of Japan’s Olympic torch relay. It represents the rocky islets of Dokdo, controlled by South Korea but claimed by Japan, which calls them Takeshima. This week South Korea “strongly” urged Japan to amend the map.</p><p>Japan’s Olympic organisers appear to have tweaked the Dokdo dot to make it harder to spot. You now have to zoom in to see it. It has also been shaded, implying territorial ambiguity.</p><p>Yet regardless of how the dot got onto the Olympic map, or of the modifications made to it, Alexis Dudden of the University of Connecticut argues that it serves as “the ultimate dog whistle” to revanchist Japanese, many in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, who think that nothing their country did during its militarist phase, including the occupation of Korea, warrants an apology. Whoever put in the dot knew it would get a rise out of easy-to-offend South Koreans. Again, Ms Dudden concludes, Japan’s far right shores up an unhealthy form of Japanese nationalism that is of no help in improving the rocky relationship between the two countries. And that is to say nothing about the want of sportsmanship in Japan’s riling its neighbour. But then nobody ever said the games are only about sport.</p><p><a id="china---china-rapidly-shifts-from-a-two-child-to-a-three-child-policy"></a></p><h1 id="China-—China-rapidly-shifts-from-a-two-child-to-a-three-child-policy"><a href="#China-—China-rapidly-shifts-from-a-two-child-to-a-three-child-policy" class="headerlink" title="(China)—China rapidly shifts from a two-child to a three-child policy"></a>(China)—China rapidly shifts from a two-child to a three-child policy</h1><p>But women’s fertility is still very much the ruling party’s business</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>For a generation, China’s government had ordained that “one child is enough” for married couples. Then, in 2016, it allowed them to have a second. On May 31st the ruling Politburo declared that a further relaxation of birth-control regulations would help China to achieve its goal of “coping” with a rapidly ageing population—a pressing task. It called for a three-child policy. Some parents will respond with glee, but most will shrug.</p><p>The government’s previous fears of galloping population growth now seem quaint. At 1.3, China’s fertility rate (the number of children an average woman is likely to have during her lifetime) is among the lowest in the world. Data from the latest decennial census, released on May 11th, showed that only 12m babies were born last year, a drop of almost 20% from 2019. It was China’s lowest population growth since the 1960s, when the country was reeling from a famine. The population now looks likely to peak in the next few years—almost a decade sooner than experts at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had, until recently, predicted.</p><p>No indication was given of when the three-child policy will take effect. But it will not end young people’s growing disdain for baby-making. Reactions online—which on many topics tend to side with the Communist Party—brimmed with scepticism. “Do they not yet know that most young people are exhausted just supporting themselves?” said one netizen on Weibo, a Twitter-like site. “This policy is totally out of touch with the people,” wrote another. An online poll by Xinhua, a state news agency, asked whether people would consider having three children. Just 5% of respondents said they would. Most others said it was “out of the question”. At least 31,000 took part in the survey before it was hastily taken down. Netizens gave a new twist to a common idiom, minbuliaosheng, which means “people have no means of livelihood”. They used it to suggest that couples “cannot even speak of giving birth” (the characters are the same).</p><p>For parents who do wish to have a third child, the change of policy will be a relief. Illicit births can incur a large fine or, in the case of civil servants, result in dismissal. Some women are put under pressure—illegally—by zealous local officials to undergo abortions if giving birth would cause a quota to be exceeded. With the three-child policy, the government is sending a signal that it is “moving very decisively to a pro-fertility policy”, says James Liang of Peking University. Mr Liang predicts that limits will “very soon” be scrapped altogether.</p><p>That would be a huge blessing for those who crave large families. But any impact on the overall birth rate is unlikely to be a lasting one. When China loosened its one-child policy, it hoped for a baby boom. After a brief initial uptick, however, births drifted downwards again. The fertility rate edged up slightly (see chart 1). Mr Liang estimates that the three-child policy could boost the fertility rate to about 1.4, still well below the level of 2.1 which is required for a population to replace itself.</p><p>Encouraged by decades of indoctrination, Chinese parents often feel—in cities as well as in villages—that a family’s resources are best devoted to one child. The high cost of housing and education, the burden of caring for elderly parents, as well as crushingly long work hours also deter young couples from having more babies, or from reproducing at all. As more women pursue careers, many are delaying marriage and motherhood.</p><p>The Politburo said it would provide better child-care facilities, improve state-funded provisions for looking after the elderly, expand maternity benefits and lower the cost of education. It also promised to “protect the rights of women in employment”. It has been doing a poor job of it. In 2019 the government vowed to make more firms comply with existing anti-discrimination laws. These ban employers from asking women about their child-rearing plans in job interviews and from stating a preference for male applicants when recruiting. Offenders can be fined up to 50,000 yuan ($7,800). In practice, they are rarely punished. In a survey released in November by Boss Zhipin, a recruitment website, more than one in three women said that managers had immediately begun looking for someone to replace them permanently after learning they were pregnant. Some firms illegally force female recruits to sign contracts promising not to have children for several years.</p><p>An image circulated by Xinhua of a poster promoting the three-child policy features two girls and a boy, probably to suggest that girls are good: a cultural preference for boys has encouraged sex-selective abortions and contributed to a highly unbalanced sex ratio. But some female netizens have noticed an irony. Lu Pin, a feminist who has been living in America since the arrest of fellow campaigners in 2015, wrote that by promoting larger families, the state was, in effect, trying to “exploit the unpaid labour of women”. The government has made no effort to encourage men to spend more time with their children.</p><p>The Communist Party is in denial. It does not admit that its coercive efforts have been misguided since the one-child policy was launched in 1979. Most of the fall in the fertility rate has been caused by urbanisation, education and the greater participation of women in the workforce. The same factors have caused similar declines in other countries with no brutally enforced birth quotas.</p><p>The party may not want to abolish caps immediately. To do so would be to acknowledge error. It would also make redundant many of the hundreds of thousands of people who work for the fertility-control apparatus. And maintaining a limit could help the party to justify some of its abuses in the far-western region of Xinjiang. Ethnic minorities there, most of whose members are Muslim, once had higher birth quotas. In 2017 the government began a campaign of forced abortions and sterilisations among Uyghurs, even targeting women within their quota. Birth rates in Xinjiang plunged. The party fears a surge of births of people whom it regards as potential troublemakers. </p><p><a id="china-will-soon-open-a-new-stretch-of-rail-across-tibet"></a></p><h1 id="China-will-soon-open-a-new-stretch-of-rail-across-Tibet"><a href="#China-will-soon-open-a-new-stretch-of-rail-across-Tibet" class="headerlink" title="China will soon open a new stretch of rail across Tibet"></a>China will soon open a new stretch of rail across Tibet</h1><p>It is one of the country’s costliest civil-engineering projects</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As birthday presents go, a 435km railway line that is expected to open this month in Tibet will be among the most lavish. To seekers of high-altitude thrills, it is one that will be cherished. The 37bn-yuan ($5.7bn) track extends from the region’s capital Lhasa eastward to the city of Nyingchi, which is Tibetan for “Throne of the Sun”. It is the region’s first electrified railway; its trains will be Tibet’s fastest. Officials call it a gift for the Communist Party’s 100th birthday, which will be officially celebrated on July 1st.</p><p>But the new line is only part of what China calls the “project of the century”. This involves building Tibet’s second rail link with China’s interior at a total cost that state media say could be about ten times that of the Lhasa-Nyingchi stretch, with even greater engineering challenges yet to come. The section about to open was no pushover. Tunnels comprise nearly half of its length. Workers had to brave landslides, poisonous gas from broken rock, intense cold as well as an oxygen-starved atmosphere at more than 5,000 metres above sea level—roughly the altitude of Mount Everest’s base camps. When completed in 2030, the railway will connect Lhasa with Chengdu, the capital of neighbouring Sichuan province. At a maximum speed of 160kph, the journey will take just 12 hours, a third of the time now required by road.</p><p>To the party, it appears no expense is too great in its campaign to integrate the vast, isolated region more closely with the interior. The first rail link, which opened in 2006, was also an engineering feat. Long lengths of that line from Qinghai province had to be laid over permafrost, using high-tech means to prevent temperature fluctuations from damaging the track.</p><p>The most obvious impact has been on tourism. In 2005 Tibet received fewer than 2m visits by tourists. By 2018 the number had soared to 33m trips (only 0.7% of them by foreigners). The government is aiming for 61m by 2025—about 17 times the number of Tibet’s inhabitants. Some Tibetans worry their culture is being swamped. An influx of Han Chinese migrants, including shopkeepers and others cashing in on the tourism boom, may have fuelled ethnic tensions that caused an explosion of unrest in Lhasa and elsewhere across the Tibet plateau in 2008. Since then the government has clamped down even harder on dissent in the region.</p><p>Strategic thinkers in India worry, too. The new railway runs close to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Chinese officials sometimes refer to as “south Tibet” and claim as Chinese territory. China’s army swept into it during a brief but bloody border war in 1962, before pulling back again. India is annoyed enough by China’s other big infrastructure project in the area: the damming of the Yarlung Tsangpo river (as it calls the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra), which the new railway crosses 16 times. It accuses China of threatening India’s water security. There is little India can do. China is telling it “you are not in my league,” says Ashok Swain of Uppsala University. The trains will keep on running regardless of any complaints. </p><p><a id="a-new-children%E2%80%99s-film-about-zhou-enlai-reveals-a-lot-about-china-today"></a></p><h1 id="A-new-children’s-film-about-Zhou-Enlai-reveals-a-lot-about-China-today"><a href="#A-new-children’s-film-about-Zhou-Enlai-reveals-a-lot-about-China-today" class="headerlink" title="A new children’s film about Zhou Enlai reveals a lot about China today"></a>A new children’s film about Zhou Enlai reveals a lot about China today</h1><p>It is a deeply conservative country, even as it prepares to celebrate its revolution</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Countries have to make revealing choices as they craft patriotic messages for children. To put it kindly, young minds are tiny treasure-houses that deserve to be stocked with only a nation’s most precious beliefs. To be more blunt, small children are easily distracted, so are best taught only a few important things.</p><p>It is therefore worth studying what China’s propaganda chiefs have in store for youngsters this summer. As usual, June 1st was marked this year in China as International Children’s Day, a festival of visits to museums, school picnics and wholesome games. A month later there will be a much larger event: celebrations on July 1st of the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding in 1921.</p><p>China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, is presented to the young as “Xi Dada”, or “Uncle Xi”, an austere but caring patriarch. Mr Xi stresses the importance of loyalty, which is why children’s choirs are busy performing such songs as “Me and My Country” and “Follow the Leadership of the Communist Party of China”. Party history is being used to inspire the masses. That explains reports of kindergarten pupils being dressed up in miniature combat fatigues and told to crawl on their bellies while clutching straw-wrapped “rations”, to re-enact Red Army supply runs. There is much talk of China entering a “new era” of prosperity, national strength and global influence. It is not hard, as a result, to find children’s drawings on public display, showing high-speed trains and space rockets adorned with Chinese flags. The young are urged to be proud of ancient glories too, as heirs to what they are told is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.</p><p>This year’s Children’s Day saw the release of a new patriotic film made especially for children. It depicts the pre-teenage life of Zhou Enlai, who was China’s prime minister from 1949 until his death from cancer in 1976. This brilliant, disappointing man is a puzzle for historians. To this day, many Chinese revere Zhou as a moderate who tempered Mao’s worst excesses, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Too often, alas, the record shows Zhou enabling Mao’s follies and failing to defend close allies from political attack. Born in 1898 into a once-grand family of scholar-officials, Zhou was a precocious student of the classics. But his childhood was blighted by the deaths of his mother and adoptive mother and by money woes that, at the age of 12, forced him to leave his birthplace, Huai’an, in the plains between the Yellow and Yangzi rivers, to seek a new life with an uncle in the north.</p><p>During the first decades of Communist rule, his privileged class background had to be explained away. A biography published in 1977, “The Early Life of Zhou Enlai” by Hu Hua, depicts Zhou as a “rebel against feudal society”, who as a boy came to hate the gentry class into which he was born. Deepening poverty turned him into a “great proletarian revolutionary”, it relates. That official history manages to praise Zhou’s traditional education while reflecting the party’s then-noisy disdain for pre-Communist codes of ethics, such as those taught by Confucius. Describing Zhou poring over books from his grandfather’s library, Hu asserts that the boy was stirred by histories of “laudable national heroes” fighting foreign invaders, but was uninterested in Confucianism.</p><p>Biographies written in the 1990s by historians in the West, including Chae-Jin Lee, Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgen, take a different view. They find that Zhou had a conventional Confucian education, which marked him for life. Nor do they agree that he was an angry rebel, noting his later, loving praise for his two mothers. Both were educated, tradition-minded daughters of scholar-officials. Indeed, they link Zhou’s survival at Mao’s side to a reverence for Confucian teachings about self-restraint and the need for officials to swallow small insults in the national interest.</p><p>The new film appears to agree. Chaguan watched “Zhou Enlai in his Childhood” on Children’s Day in a cinema in Huai’an. The movie does not hide Zhou’s ancestral wealth. It portrays him as a solemn little boy in a silk gown, visiting relatives in antique-filled mansions. Confucian customs are shown as expressions of love. The young Zhou kowtows to his elders and studies cobwebbed texts to make his dying mother proud. His adoptive mother teaches him to swallow an unjust punishment with tales of an ancient general who endured humiliations on his way to greatness.</p><p>The film is not fast-paced. There is much fidgeting in the cinema, though children perk up at a brief shot of a boy’s bare bottom, and again when Zhou urges his adoptive mother to drink ink as a medicine. The Zhou family’s struggles to afford a middle-class life are crafted to resonate with older cinema-goers. Zhou’s father, a petty official in another town, is depicted as a migrant worker—largely absent, always fretting about money, and emotionally distant from his own son. The film shows health crises that wreck family finances and trigger rows about whether to spend money on medicine or school fees. Such dilemmas remain common today. The film’s ending unites all ages. Over swelling chords, young Zhou waxes indignant on learning that Russia and Japan have taken territory from the ailing Chinese empire, then declares that he studies hard so that China may rise. That phrase of Zhou’s is taught in schools to this day, and triggers murmurs of recognition.</p><p>Nationalism instead of class struggle<br>After the film, a mother in the audience, Lu Ye, calls it “very educational” to see the orphaned Zhou confront debt-collectors, endure hardships and assume responsibilities beyond his years. Ms Lu’s 12-year-old son, Rongye, says that he “really liked” the film. He praises an episode in which Zhou picked and sold wild vegetables to help repay those debts, until his hands bled. “For the welfare of the family, he didn’t care,” Rongye notes approvingly.</p><p>The film-makers say that their aim is to promote education and family harmony. China is a deeply conservative place, even as it prepares to celebrate its revolutionary past. Chinese children, told constantly to be diligent and obedient, sensed that all along. </p><p><a id="middle-east--africa---france-tries-to-reset-policy-in-africa"></a></p><h1 id="Middle-East-amp-Africa-—France-tries-to-reset-policy-in-Africa"><a href="#Middle-East-amp-Africa-—France-tries-to-reset-policy-in-Africa" class="headerlink" title="(Middle East &amp; Africa)—France tries to reset policy in Africa"></a>(Middle East &amp; Africa)—France tries to reset policy in Africa</h1><p>It is asking forgiveness for its past and rethinking its future</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>France “must look history in the face and recognise the share of suffering that it inflicted on the Rwandan people”. So declared President Emmanuel Macron at the genocide memorial in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, on May 27th (pictured). “In ignoring the warnings of the most clear-sighted observers,” he said, “France bore damning responsibility in a chain of events that led to the worst.” He hoped survivors of the genocide might “perhaps forgive” France.</p><p>Mr Macron is the first French president to recognise his country’s responsibility in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, mostly Tutsis, in 1994. France backed and armed the Hutu regime that planned and carried out the massacres. French leaders long claimed their country had “misunderstood” what was going on. Rwanda, under Tutsi leadership, cut diplomatic ties with France in 2006. In his speech, Mr Macron disappointed some survivors of the genocide by not explicitly apologising. But Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, said his words were “more powerful than an apology”.</p><p>In Paris Mr Macron’s acknowledgment is considered part of an effort to reset policy in Africa, using history to reshape current ties. Last year France returned 27 works of art to Benin and Senegal, after Mr Macron promised to start handing back artefacts taken under colonial rule. He also agreed to end the French treasury-backed cfa franc, a west African currency some regard as a colonial relic (and which is still used). This year historians have published two official reports: one, by Benjamin Stora, on France’s role in Algeria, the other, by Vincent Duclert, on its actions during the Rwandan genocide. “History weighs heavily on our relationship with Africa,” says Hervé Berville, a Rwandan-born deputy from Mr Macron’s party: “Treating questions of history and memory is indispensable, especially for younger people, if we want to build healthier ties.”</p><p>The 992-page Duclert report is damning. It concludes that France bore “overwhelming responsibility” for not doing more to stop the slaughter. Officials, aid workers or reporters who queried French policy at the time “were met with indifference, rejection or bad faith”. Decision-making on Rwanda was centralised at the presidency, under François Mitterrand. Officials dismissed the massacres as a merely “tribal” conflict. Behind France’s policy was a primordial worry: the “threat of an Anglo-Saxon world”, represented by Mr Kagame’s English-speaking Rwandan Patriotic Front, which was leading an insurgency against (and ultimately overthrew) the French-speaking Hutu regime.</p><p>Mr Macron’s Africa reset is based on a fresh geostrategic calculation. France has in the past sought to perpetuate “Françafrique”, a cosy web of ties with its ex-colonies. Mr Macron, by contrast, declared in 2017 that he was from a “generation that does not come and tell Africa what to do”. Keen to promote broader French economic interests, and wary of competition from China and Turkey, he has courted non-French-speaking leaders. After Rwanda, he headed to South Africa to discuss getting covid-19 vaccines to the continent, as well as more French business.</p><p>There is a tension in this strategy. Engaging with Mr Kagame’s authoritarian regime, increasingly friendless in the English-speaking world, is controversial. History still underpins the old network, if not the new. France keeps 5,100 soldiers in the (heavily French-speaking) Sahel as part of Operation Barkhane, a counter-insurgency operation. In April it looked like business as usual when Mr Macron flew to Chad for the funeral of Idriss Déby, the country’s strongman ruler for three decades, calling him a “loyal friend”. Chad is France’s main military partner in Operation Barkhane.</p><p>France’s Sahel policy is under particular strain after the recent ousting of Mali’s president and prime minister by Assimi Goita, who led a military coup last year as well. On June 2nd the African Union suspended Mali’s membership and threatened sanctions if a civilian-led government is not restored. Mr Macron, who is due to review troop levels in the region, has declared, “We can’t stay there for ever.” But history suggests that such threats are easier to issue than to carry out. </p><p><a id="binyamin-netanyahu%E2%80%99s-opponents-reach-a-deal-to-replace-him"></a></p><h1 id="Binyamin-Netanyahu’s-opponents-reach-a-deal-to-replace-him"><a href="#Binyamin-Netanyahu’s-opponents-reach-a-deal-to-replace-him" class="headerlink" title="Binyamin Netanyahu’s opponents reach a deal to replace him"></a>Binyamin Netanyahu’s opponents reach a deal to replace him</h1><p>But the prime minister won’t give up without a fight</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Naftali bennett, the tech millionaire turned politician who is poised to become Israel’s next prime minister, began his political career in 2006 as chief of staff to Binyamin Netanyahu, then the leader of the opposition. Mr Bennett (pictured) admired Mr Netanyahu for years and played a key role in his return to power in 2009. Mr Bennett’s memoir begins with a note of gratitude to his former boss, and ends with an adulatory chapter entitled “What I learned from Binyamin Netanyahu”.</p><p>How times have changed. Mr Bennett’s Yamina party is now part of a coalition that is on the verge of ending Mr Netanyahu’s 12-year reign as prime minister. The coalition deal, featuring eight parties holding 61 seats (see chart), was finalised just before a midnight deadline on June 2nd. But the potential new government still must win a confidence vote in the 120-seat Knesset (Israel’s parliament) in the coming days. Mr Netanyahu will undoubtedly do everything in his power to prevent that from happening.</p><p>It is no wonder that the negotiations came down to the wire. Israel is used to governments made up of disparate parties, but this one would be the most diverse in history. On the right are Mr Bennett’s Yamina, along with two other nationalist parties (Yisrael Beiteinu and New Hope) which are also led by former aides to Mr Netanyahu (Avigdor Lieberman and Gideon Sa’ar). In the centre is the coalition’s largest party, Yesh Atid, led by Yair Lapid, a secularist. He is the architect of the new government. Under the deal, he would take over from Mr Bennett as prime minister if the government lasts more than two years.</p><p>There are other centrist and left-wing parties in the coalition, but what makes it historic is the inclusion of Ra’am, which has four seats. It would become the first truly independent Arab party to join a government since Israel’s founding in 1948. For decades the Arab parties have been shunned and, in turn, have shown little interest in joining a coalition. Ra’am will not hold any cabinet seats. But its leader, Mansour Abbas, used the party’s leverage as a potential kingmaker to obtain greater resources for Israel’s Arab minority.</p><p>It took the parties opposed to Mr Netanyahu time to get their act together. In three of the four elections since 2019 they won a majority of seats, but they failed to join up before now. Weeks of nerve-racking negotiations over who would get which cabinet posts preceded the current agreement. At one point Mr Bennett abandoned the talks, reportedly citing the conflict in Gaza and Arab-Jewish clashes on the streets of Israeli cities last month. But his negotiations with the prime minister bore no fruit. “The elections have proven there is no right-wing government under Netanyahu,” said Mr Bennett on May 30th. “There’s unity or fifth elections.”</p><p>In order to lead the new government effectively Mr Bennett will have to suppress some of his more right-wing views. In the past he has opposed the creation of a Palestinian state and favoured annexing much of the occupied West Bank. He is an ardent supporter of settlers, once leading the council representing them (though he is not a settler himself). Some regard him as more right-wing than Mr Netanyahu, though not nearly as ruthless. He is also an observant Jew: if sworn in, he would be the first prime minister to wear a yarmulke, or Jewish skullcap, for everyday affairs.</p><p>But Mr Bennett notes that he is not the only coalition member with what some consider extreme views. “For the new government to succeed, all the partners will need to exercise restraint,” he has said. “No one will be asked to give up on their ideology, but everyone will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams. We will focus on what can be done, instead of arguing over what is impossible.”</p><p>Perhaps the coalition can take some inspiration from the Knesset’s election of a new president of Israel on June 2nd. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly for Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labour party and government minister. The president’s role is mostly symbolic. Still, it was a rare display of consensus for the divided body.</p><p>Bibi’s last stand<br>Mustering a majority is a big achievement for the opposition. But it is not over the finish line yet. The parties reportedly discussed a range of issues during their negotiations, from committee posts to legalising cannabis. Some reports suggested that there were still details to be hashed out. Then there is the confidence vote, which could take place as early as June 7th—or the speaker of the Knesset, a Netanyahu loyalist, could try to delay it by an extra week.</p><p>In that time Mr Netanyahu will try to pick off wavering members of the coalition in order to deny it a majority. They are already coming under pressure. Members of Mr Bennett’s party have been called “traitors” by the prime minister’s allies. Protests have been held outside their homes. Senior rabbis have phoned them to warn of the spiritual dangers that the new government poses to the Jewish people.</p><p>Mr Netanyahu is also doing his part. In a televised tantrum on May 30th, he accused Mr Bennett of carrying out “the fraud of the century” and compared the new coalition to Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria and to the rulers of Iran. “Don’t form a left-wing government—such a government is a danger to Israel’s security and future,” said Mr Netanyahu.</p><p>Such intimidation has worked in the past, and one member of Mr Bennett’s party has already defected to the prime minister’s side. But Mr Netanyahu’s act is getting old. Mr Bennett has accused him of “trying to take the entire state of Israel with him to his personal Masada”—a reference to the hilltop fortress where Jewish rebels committed mass suicide 1,900 years ago, rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. He and others on the right turned on Mr Netanyahu not because they disagree with his hardline policies, but, as Mr Bennett explained, “because no one believed [his] promises would be kept”. </p>]]></content>

Over lunch, he and two other residents of Buckhead, the wealthy northern section of Atlanta, swap stories: packs of cars blocking intersections for illegal street races, would-be thieves casing houses, neighbours too frightened to leave their homes. Lenox Square, an upscale mall, installed metal detectors after a spate of shootings. Mr White is head of fundraising for the Buckhead Exploratory Committee—a group of residents who have organised to push for Buckhead’s independence from Atlanta, driven, he explains, by three factors: “crime, crime and crime”.</p><p>As of May 16th, murders were up by 59% in Atlanta compared with the same period in 2020. Rapes, aggravated assaults and thefts from and of cars are also well above levels in 2020. Nor is this just an Atlanta problem. Nationally, the spike in murders that began in 2020—according to data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, homicides in American cities rose by 33% from 2019 to 2020—shows no sign of abating. This is a problem first, of course, for the people living in the neighbourhoods where much of this violence takes place. But it also poses a problem for advocates of criminal-justice reform, who made great strides in the 2010s, when violent crime was falling. Convincing people to back lighter sentences and decrease their reliance on police when murders are rising may prove more difficult.</p><p>The reasons why murder rates are on the rise nationally remain unclear. In fact criminologists are still debating why crime fell in the 1990s and 2000s. The pandemic closed schools and other institutions, leaving young people unoccupied and anxious. Police who might otherwise have been deployed to high-crime neighbourhoods or investigative duty were assigned to respond to protests. Gun sales soared, and many faced financial hardships and other stresses. But violent-crime rates were rising, albeit more slowly than over the past 14 months, even before the covid-19 epidemic began, beginning in 2014.</p><p>Whatever the reason, “homicides can be sticky”, says John Pfaff of Fordham University in New York. “A shooting in March can lead to a subsequent shooting in July, when retaliation comes up.” In other words, even if the pandemic is partly responsible for the homicide spike, any post-pandemic decline may well be gradual.</p><p>As a result, crime now has a political salience that it has not had in years. A poll released last month showed crime was the second-most-important issue (behind covid-19) for Democrats in New York, who will choose a mayoral candidate in a primary on June 22nd. Eric Adams, a former police officer who has recently defended the use of stop-and-frisk tactics and made public safety the centre of his campaign, leads in some polls. Jenny Durkan, Seattle’s mayor, has faced criticism from both the right and left over her handling of the city’s police-free “autonomous zone” and tactics used by police against protesters; she will not seek another term. Chesa Boudin, San Francisco’s district attorney, faces a recall campaign, driven by the perception that he is too soft on crime. Crime has become central in the race to succeed Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta’s mayor, who also unexpectedly declined to seek a second term.</p><p>But before she leaves office, she plans to hire another 250 police officers. Other cities have taken a similar approach. Minneapolis, where a majority of the city council voted last year to defund and disband the police department, will spend $6.4m to hire new officers. While president of Baltimore’s city council, Brandon Scott championed a measure to cut the police department’s budget by $22.4m; since taking office last December as mayor, he has proposed increasing it by $28m. Oakland will soon restore most of the $29m it cut from the police budget last year.</p><p>Such reversals testify more to the political than the budgetary costs of criminal-justice reform. But that does not mean reform is doomed, or that all voters will reject all reform-minded candidates. Last month Tishaura Jones was elected mayor of St Louis on a platform that included reducing reliance on police and closing one of the city’s prisons. In a primary race on May 18th, Larry Krasner, Philadelphia’s crusading district attorney, trounced his police-union-backed opponent. On that same day, Ed Gainey, running on a reformist platform, defeated Bill Peduto in a primary election. He is poised to become Pittsburgh’s first black mayor.</p><p>Still, blame-mongering for violence is an effective cudgel for conservative state-level politicians to wield against liberal cities. Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, is making Atlanta crime central to his re-election campaign—the better to win back Trump-hesitant Republicans in the city’s suburbs. Florida has passed a law that lets the governor and his cabinet reverse any changes to cities’ police budgets that they deem unwise. Other states have proposed (and Texas has passed) measures cutting off funds to cities that slash police budgets. Unlike states, which the Tenth Amendment protects against federal overreach, cities are subsidiary creations of the state, and have no legal shield against these sorts of pre-emptive measures.</p><p>Reformers will have to change how they pitch their ideas. They cannot simply make a moral case. The impetus that led conservative and liberal states alike to reduce their prison populations in recent years was largely to save money. And, as Mr Pfaff notes, homicides are up nationwide, so if rising violent-crime rates indict reform in liberal cities, they must also indict the status quo in more conservative areas that have not pursued reform.</p><p>“The rise in violence just makes everything related to these debates over how to reform policing and how to deal with police violence more difficult,” explains Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at Princeton University. “There’s a knee-jerk response because we’ve been so reliant on police and prisons as the institutions we turn to to deal with violence.” Faced with a choice between more and less policing, people frightened of violent crime will rarely choose less.</p><p>In fact the choice is not binary. Police play a crucial role in fighting crime and, in the near term, cities may require a more robust police presence than some reformers would like. They do not play the only role, however. A wealth of evidence exists that other institutions—anti-violence non-profits, drug-treatment programmes, summer jobs for young people—also help. Politicians who want to reduce violent crime in their cities and states should remember that, just as activists should remember that reform is a harder sell when people do not feel safe. Because, since murders usually rise in the summer, when people are out in the streets until late, safety is unlikely to return soon.</p><p><a id="the-january-6th-commission-and-the-two-main-weaknesses-of-america%E2%80%99s-democracy"></a></p><h1 id="The-January-6th-commission-and-the-two-main-weaknesses-of-America’s-democracy"><a href="#The-January-6th-commission-and-the-two-main-weaknesses-of-America’s-democracy" class="headerlink" title="The January 6th commission and the two main weaknesses of America’s democracy"></a>The January 6th commission and the two main weaknesses of America’s democracy</h1><p>The Senate functions intermittently. The GOP remains Trumpified</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It was the distilled essence of legislative dysfunction. On May 28th the Senate rejected a painstakingly negotiated bipartisan bill that would have set up a commission to study the storming of the Capitol building by incensed Donald Trump supporters on January 6th. Though the vote was 54 in favour and 35 opposed (all of them Republicans), the measure technically failed, because a filibuster—ostensibly the threat of debating a bill to death—requires 60 votes to avoid it. This flop puts two serious problems with American democracy in relief. One is that Congress can be hamstrung by a minority. The other is that the Republican Party is unwilling to escape the shackles of Trumpism.</p><p>Start with the filibuster rule and its result. It would be hard to concoct a clearer demonstration of what is wrong with the rule as it currently functions. It did not matter that 60% of those present voted in favour of the commission, nor that the opponents of the bill really had no intention of debating it. Indeed, the blocking of the commission shows that the majority of elected Republicans wish not to discuss the attack on the Capitol, as if it could be shushed away like a child’s nightmare.</p><p>Many Democrats, who hold majorities in both chambers, hope that the death of the commission may also hasten the death of the filibuster itself, thus allowing them to legislate without needing ten Republican votes that will probably never materialise. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, plans to move forward with voting-rights legislation by the end of June. Party activists believe this bill represents the best chance of breaking the filibuster’s stranglehold over the chamber. Filibuster rules have been slowly chiselled away over the past few decades: first to allow the confirmation of executive-branch appointees by simple majority, and, later, justices to the Supreme Court. A further whittling by exempting voting-rights and civil-rights legislation could be in order.</p><p>Tweaking the rules, or dismantling them entirely, would take just a simple majority of senators, which Democrats possess by the narrowest margin possible. But two conservative Democrats—Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona—remain staunch opponents of filibuster reform. Both of them attempted to drum-up Republican support for the commission, without much to show for it (Ms Sinema skipped the vote altogether). Activists hope that their failure will permanently shake their confidence in the filibuster, which after all is often justified on the ground that it promotes bipartisanship. But both seem unlikely to budge,</p><p>The other upshot is that Republicans remain in no mood for introspection. After a few brief weeks of being clear-eyed about who inspired the attack and what it meant, Congressional Republicans lost their appetite for moving beyond Trumpism. True believers in Mr Trump’s conspiracy theory of electoral fraud have every incentive to continue; meanwhile those merely going along out of cravenness or opportunism have no incentive to speak up.</p><p>The party’s congressional leaders, Mitch McConnell in the Senate and Kevin McCarthy in the House of Representatives, have reverted from antipathy for the former president to accommodating him. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mr McCarthy said that the president was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day”. His deputies negotiated the contours of the would-be commission; then he voted against it. Mr McConnell, who denounced Mr Trump forcefully in February, whipped against the bill’s passage in the Senate (calling it a “purely political exercise” for Democrats who “would like to continue to debate things that occurred in the past”).</p><p>This is but the latest warning sign to flash. On May 30th, Republicans in Texas were only narrowly thwarted from passing some of the strictest voting rules in the country when Democrats staged a walkout, denying a quorum. States have enacted 22 restrictive new voting laws this year as a response to Mr Trump’s false allegations of fraud. More than six months after the election, conspiracists in Arizona are still counting and recounting the ballots that gave President Joe Biden a narrow win in the state, hunting for traces of bamboo fibres in the paper ballots to show that they were imported from Asia.</p><p>The party recently dumped Liz Cheney, a staunchly conservative Republican representative, from her leadership post for the sin of not adopting the requisite omertà towards Mr Trump’s anti-democratic tendencies. On June 1st, over 100 prominent American political scientists and scholars signed an open letter warning that some states “no longer meet the minimum conditions for free and fair elections” and that “our entire democracy is now at risk”.</p><p>The odds that concerned Republicans can reverse, or even stall, their party’s slide look remote. Mr Trump remains the party’s de facto leader, and barring a health crisis (or an indictment), plans to run for president again. Having demonstrated his version of the anti-democratic playbook—denouncing the legitimacy of lost elections and trying to break the constitutional guardrails against reversing the results—Mr Trump, or some imitator, might well try the same again. </p><p><a id="congress-is-set-to-make-a-down-payment-on-innovation-in-america"></a></p><h1 id="Congress-is-set-to-make-a-down-payment-on-innovation-in-America"><a href="#Congress-is-set-to-make-a-down-payment-on-innovation-in-America" class="headerlink" title="Congress is set to make a down-payment on innovation in America"></a>Congress is set to make a down-payment on innovation in America</h1><p>Federal spending on research is about to get a boost</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Senator harley kilgore, a West Virginia oil prospector’s son who carried around a horse chestnut for good luck, had a vision for American science. It was too dominated, he thought, by big business and by the university system: the country’s practical needs were an afterthought. In 1942 Kilgore proposed creating a federal bureaucracy, responsive to the public, that would guide scientific research for the good of the country and distribute its benefits geographically.</p><p>Kilgore was opposed by Vannevar Bush (pictured above), who led American r&amp;d during the second world war. Bush felt that scientific research should be directed by the scientists themselves. In a report for the president called “Science: The Endless Frontier”, Bush summarised his ideas. Government, he said, should fund research. But rather than direct this research towards meeting social needs, it should instead seek to advance science for its own sake: basic, not applied, science was to be the primary objective. Bush won the day. The National Science Foundation (nsf), born in 1950, has largely followed the principles he laid out.</p><p>Kilgore is about to get his revenge. The Senate will probably soon pass the us Innovation and Competition Act, known until recently as the Endless Frontier Act. Though the bill is named after Bush’s report, it will take American science policy in a more Kilgorian direction. It lays out ten “key technology focus areas,” such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology and advanced materials science, to which new research funding will be directed. It allocates funding for regional tech hubs spread across the country. And its objectives are clear: the goal, in true Kilgorian fashion, is to “enhance the competitive advantage and leadership of the United States in the global economy”.</p><p>When it was first introduced in May 2020, the Endless Frontier Act planned to set aside $100bn for a new Directorate for Technology and Innovation within the nsf. This would have borrowed characteristics from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa), the military-research office responsible for spearheading research that led to the internet, the computer mouse and mrna vaccines.</p><p>The act’s ambitions have since narrowed. Instead of the full $100bn, the nsf’s new tech directorate will get $4bn. Some of the money has gone to pork. A significant portion has been diverted to the Department of Energy’s national labs. Though more than $50bn of funding will go to nsf, much of it either replaces existing funding or is earmarked for causes other than r&amp;d, such as stem education.</p><p>Innovation experts advise against looking a gift horse in the mouth, however. Federal spending on research has fallen from more than 1.2% of gdp in 1976 to less than 0.8% today. As a portion of the federal budget, it has dropped from 12% at its 1960s peak to 3%. The money set aside for r&amp;d in the new bill will not reverse this slide. But the law will still deliver substantial additional funding to the nsf: its budget for 2022 will be 27% higher than in 2021 and will double over the next five years. Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose work helped to spur the legislation, views the act as a “down payment” towards future innovation.</p><p>Others view it as a missed opportunity. Samuel Hammond of the Niskanen Centre, a think-tank, acknowledges that the influx of cash is valuable, but pines for what might have been. Science, he says, needs not just new funding but new institutions as well. Some researchers spend more than 40% of their time on administrative tasks such as grant-writing. Studies have found grant evaluations are inconsistent and subjective. Since the number of grant applications has increased faster than available funding, high-quality work may languish unfunded. And though scientists tend to do their best work in their younger years, the recipients of research grants have been getting steadily older.</p><p>Mr Hammond believes that government agencies that fund research have become sclerotic: he sees a “compliance culture” resulting from a risk-averse leadership wary of heavy-handed congressional oversight. That is a problem, says Benjamin Reinhardt, an independent researcher who has studied darpa, because big wins come from taking risks. “All the value,” he says, “is in the long tail.”</p><p>One reason to create new research-funding institutions is to turn the scientific process on itself. Some economists have suggested prizes for big breakthroughs. New Zealand has experimented with lotteries for grant funding. Two researchers, Adam Marblestone and Sam Rodriques, have proposed Focused Research Organisations, stand-alone research efforts concentrated on solving single, well-defined science or technology problems.</p><p>Mr Gruber agrees that existing funding agencies are too conservative, and wishes the bill were bigger. But he believes it is a good start. The promotion of regional tech hubs, he says, could result in a virtuous cycle: once science and technology are no longer concentrated on the coasts, Americans may become more receptive to increases in r&amp;d funding in the future. And, in the selection of ten key technology areas to focus on, he sees the beginnings of a less tentative approach to innovation. “You can call it picking winners,” he avers. “I call it taking risks.”</p><p><a id="the-pandemic-pushed-more-americans-to-try-out-van-life"></a></p><h1 id="The-pandemic-pushed-more-Americans-to-try-out-van-life"><a href="#The-pandemic-pushed-more-Americans-to-try-out-van-life" class="headerlink" title="The pandemic pushed more Americans to try out van life"></a>The pandemic pushed more Americans to try out van life</h1><p>But the viral travel fad isn’t as carefree as Instagram makes it out to be</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 2019 lucy jacobson and her colleagues at Rossmönster Vans flew to San Francisco carrying “suitcases full of cash”. They were on their way to purchase five retro Volkswagen vans made in the 1980s in order to drive them back to Longmont, Colorado and turn them into custom adventure-mobiles. The road trip home took them to Las Vegas (“to let our freak flag fly”), through Utah’s canyons and over the Rockies. It was the kind of expedition increasing numbers of Americans are hankering for.</p><p>About 140,000 vans, rvs or boats were counted as housing units in 2019 according to the Census Bureau, up from about 102,000 in 2016. The circumstances of people who live in their vans can be glaringly different. On one end of the spectrum are those who, like the folks in Jessica Bruder’s book “Nomadland” have little alternative. On the other end are van lifers or “digital nomads” who covet a bohemian, go-anywhere lifestyle. Type #VanLife into Instagram and more than 10m posts appear. Most photos feature pristine Western landscapes, some kind of van or mobile home that resembles a Manhattan studio apartment on wheels, and at least one smiling 20-something. Dogs are a popular accessory.</p><p>As social-media influencers spread the van-life gospel, a lucrative industry blossomed. A custom van renovation at Rossmönster costs customers anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000—not including the cost of the van itself. Dave Walsh, the founder of Vanlife Customs in Denver, says he has seen revenues grow by at least 50% every year since his company’s founding in 2016.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, things looked bleak. National parks closed, leaving fewer picturesque places to camp. Jeff Cavins, a co-founder of Outdoorsy, an Airbnb-esque marketplace for van and camper rentals, says 95% of the firm’s bookings were cancelled. Then, business boomed. Outdoorsy’s bookings rocketed by 4,000% between April and October of 2020 as parks reopened and Americans fled city centres for greener places. Dave &amp; Matt Vans in Gypsum, Colorado went from five employees in early 2020 to nearly 30 today. Rossmönster can take no new customers until September 2022. The trend looks likely to continue. Surging house prices and the normalisation of remote work may push more wannabe nomads out on the road.</p><p>Ask any van lifer why they decided to trade their roof for wheels and the word “freedom” will inevitably come up. “I wanted to travel, was single and free and thought ‘Why not try this?’” says Mr Walsh. But the lifestyle that has gone viral on Instagram is a shiny version of what can be a dusty existence. “There’s a lot of butts and thongs with beautiful views behind them”, Mr Walsh adds, “but it’s not always a real portrayal of van life.” The endless search for parking, toilets and wifi might not be so alluring.</p><p><a id="horseracing-the-sport-of-kings-needs-more-punters-and-fewer-drugs"></a></p><h1 id="Horseracing-the-sport-of-kings-needs-more-punters-and-fewer-drugs"><a href="#Horseracing-the-sport-of-kings-needs-more-punters-and-fewer-drugs" class="headerlink" title="Horseracing, the sport of kings, needs more punters and fewer drugs"></a>Horseracing, the sport of kings, needs more punters and fewer drugs</h1><p>Why America’s racetracks face long odds</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“It’s a win-win,” says Zach Noren, who is visiting Belmont Park, a racetrack on the border of Long Island and New York City, with his three-year-old son Jack. “He likes the horses and I like to bet.” Mr Noren normally pays attention to the “ponies” only for Triple Crown events, like the Kentucky Derby. This is not unusual. There were few punters at Belmont on a recent Sunday afternoon. The virus may have made people wary of placing a flutter in person, but interest in racing has been dwindling for years.</p><p>The public perception that the horses are mistreated or over-medicated has contributed to that. Part of the problem, says Bennett Liebman of Albany Law School, is that there is no regular mainstream sports coverage of racing. “Any time somebody covers horse racing, outside of the Triple Crown, the news tends to be bad.” There has been no shortage of bad news lately. Medina Spirit, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, tested positive for an excessive amount of betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug permitted only in limited amounts. On June 2nd Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, suspended Bob Baffert, Medina Spirit’s trainer, for two years. Last month the New York Racing Authority banned him from its tracks, including the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown, taking place on June 5th.</p><p>Mr Baffert and his shock of white hair are known beyond the stables and grandstand. His horses have won 16 Triple Crown races, including six Kentucky Derbys, but he has also received many medication infractions, five in 13 months alone. He denies any wrongdoing. Kathy Guillermo of peta, an animal-rights group, is sceptical. She recalls that in 2000, after one of his horses tested positive for morphine, Mr Baffert testified that it might have eaten a poppy-seed bagel.</p><p>Ms Guillermo says that the medicines can cause catastrophic injuries and death on the track. Some horses are on several, known as “stacking”. As long as they are within the approved limit, this is allowed. But the cumulative damage of masking an injury means that a horse is at greater risk of collapsing and needing to be put down.</p><p>Forty-nine horses died at the Santa Anita track in California during the 2018-19 fiscal year, according to a report by the Los Angeles district attorney. Many had multiple drugs in their systems on the day they died. California eliminated stacking in 2019. Some trainers complain that the different rules in each jurisdiction are confusing. That will soon change, as national oversight is coming into the home stretch. The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act will require uniform safety standards, including anti-doping and medication control. Scott Stanley, a chemist at the Gluck Equine Centre, is helping to write the rules. He is already seeing fewer medication infractions in his service lab in Kentucky.</p><p>But racing faces other challenges. ibisWorld, a research firm, says the industry is in a state of long-term decline. Fewer punters means track closures. Arlington Racecourse outside Chicago, which has just begun its final season, will be sold for development. Some tracks have diversified into slot machines and casinos. Demand has eroded as competing entertainment and other forms of gambling siphon off potential customers. Racing’s loyal fans tend to be on the older side. The Triple Crown events still retain interest, but a few minutes of excitement once a year is not a durable business model. </p><p><a id="hispanic-americans-are-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19"></a></p><h1 id="Hispanic-Americans-are-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19"><a href="#Hispanic-Americans-are-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19" class="headerlink" title="Hispanic Americans are most vulnerable to covid-19"></a>Hispanic Americans are most vulnerable to covid-19</h1><p>Researchers still do not understand why</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, racial minorities were three times as likely to be hospitalised with covid-19 as whites. But why? Data scientists at a3.ai, a health-research group, analysed the insurance records of 14m patients in the Covid-19 Research Database, 380,000 of whom were diagnosed with the virus, to disentangle the causes for The Economist. Even controlling for education, income, age and prior health conditions does not explain what is going on. But one notable finding is that Hispanic Americans were the most vulnerable group.</p><p><a id="fewer-americans-are-going-hungry"></a></p><h1 id="Fewer-Americans-are-going-hungry"><a href="#Fewer-Americans-are-going-hungry" class="headerlink" title="Fewer Americans are going hungry"></a>Fewer Americans are going hungry</h1><p>What went so right?</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“Since we took office,” tweeted President Joe Biden on May 23rd, “hunger rates have dropped 43%.” That statistic, although astonishing, is broadly correct, according to data from the Census Bureau. “That’s the American Rescue Plan at work,” Mr Biden added. The claim of causality, however, is less certain.</p><p>Since April 2020 the Household Pulse Survey, carried out by the Census Bureau, has asked a representative sample of American adults whether there was enough to eat in their household over the previous week. The share who respond either that there is “sometimes” or “often” not enough food are classified as living in hunger. Over the course of the covid-19 epidemic, this proportion has hovered around 10%. It peaked just ahead of Christmas at 13.7%, equivalent to 30m people. Since then the figure has fallen steeply (see chart). The survey, carried out between April 28th and May 10th, put the figure at 8.7%, or 18.2m people.</p><p>Although Mr Biden would like to credit his American Rescue Plan for this improvement, the claim does not stand up to closer inspection. The president signed that bill on March 11th, yet by March 17th the share of people saying that they had not eaten properly had already fallen to its lowest since covid-19 was diagnosed widely in America. It took at least six days for the first Rescue Plan cheques, worth $1,400 for every adult, to be received, suggesting that the initial decline in hunger was caused by something else.</p><p>There are several possible reasons why hunger has fallen. First, the steadily improving economy. The unemployment rate has fallen from its peak of 14.8% in April 2020 to 6.1%. However, hunger rates did not begin to decline until the final days of 2020; they remained stubbornly high last year even as unemployment fell. On a state-by-state basis, there appears to be little relationship between the change in unemployment and the fall in hunger rates over the past year. Another possible explanation is the reopening of schools, which may have given more children access to subsidised food. But again, school reopenings did not begin until well after hunger began to trend downwards.</p><p>A third possible cause of the decline in hunger is one that Mr Biden may not wish to trumpet. An earlier round of stimulus cheques worth $600 was delivered in December 2020 to every American adult, under legislation signed by the outgoing president, Donald Trump. That bill also increased food-stamp benefits by 15%. The cheques were sent out on December 29th, precisely when hunger rates began falling.</p><p>Although the American Rescue Plan may not have started the decline in hunger, it is likely to play a role in sustaining it. Experts say that the vital signs of labour markets, such as earnings and unemployment—which is still nearly twice its pre-pandemic rate—are closely tied to levels of hunger. Therefore extraordinary benefits, such as the cheques approved by both Mr Trump and Mr Biden, have kept hunger rates lower than they otherwise would have been. The government may hand out more money later this year, while the American Rescue Plan has extended food stamps, too. Both policies are likely to help keep hunger at bay.</p><p><a id="who-owns-the-national-pastime"></a></p><h1 id="Who-owns-the-national-pastime"><a href="#Who-owns-the-national-pastime" class="headerlink" title="Who owns the national pastime?"></a>Who owns the national pastime?</h1><p>At home with the redoubtable Frederick Keys</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Nothing says spring like the thwack of cowhide on maple. It follows that nothing says mass vaccination like the sound echoing through a crowded ballpark. Lexington and 3,000 other Marylanders experienced this thrill one sunny evening last week in Frederick, Maryland, home of the redoubtable Frederick Keys.</p><p>It was in effect the team’s first home game, the previous day’s fixture having been rained off. And rarely had the rituals of small-town baseball—back after an 18-month, covid-enforced hiatus—felt more welcome. Children with cotton candy and mitts raced around the concourse. Neighbours and workmates hailed each other, relaxed and mostly maskless, as they queued for pizza and beers. All rose for the Star-Spangled Banner—whose lyrics are particularly prized in Frederick, having been written by a former resident, Francis Scott Key, after whom the ball club is named.</p><p>In Section 107, behind home plate, season-ticket holders indulged in another minor-league tradition: casting a critical eye over the new blood. It included the anthem singer (“We’ve had worse—remember the bell ringers?” said Meri-Lyn, an executive assistant who rarely misses a game) and the over-enthusiastic compere (“She needs to keep off the energy drinks,” deadpanned Don, a security-systems expert, between logging each ball into his tablet). All the Keys’ white-uniformed players were also new.</p><p>“They don’t look too bad,” offered Don’s wife, Colleen, as the home team battled back from a sleepy start. Its lead-off hitter, a 22-year-old Nevadan called Nick Hernandez, was the first to impress the diehards, after he smacked a double, then a homer in the sixth. “Go Nick, we need you to win this!”</p><p>This ritual reflected the churn of talent that is a feature of pro baseball’s lower levels. Since the evolution of the farm system in the 1920s, the minors have had little or no control over their squads, which their major-league patron recruits, pays and treats as feeder-stock. In a normal year, two-thirds of a minor-league team may be new, and it is liable to be raided by its patron during the season. Any minor leaguer good enough to be embraced by the fans is almost by definition halfway out the door. The same is true for a local ballpark’s announcers and entertainers. Paradoxically, this makes one of the most locally rooted institutions in American sport—the small-town ball club where local couples court each other, entertain their children and advertise their businesses—also one of the most transient.</p><p>With forbearance on both sides, this has been a fruitful tension. Major League Baseball, the game’s monopolistic overseer, has suffered the inefficiencies of a diffuse system for its talent-pool. Minor-league fans have forgone a deep relationship with their teams for the thrill of a prestigious connection to the majors and high-quality baseball—often in places, such as Clinton, Iowa, or Niles, Ohio, with little else to boast of. But MLB has upset this balance. Teams like the Keys are emerging from covid-induced calamity—the scrapping of a season and over 40m prospective ticket sales—to the most traumatic shake-up of the minors in decades.</p><p>On the expiry of a pre-existing operating agreement late last year, MLB cut its roster of minor-league affiliates by 42, hardened its grip on the remaining 120, and in the process scrapped several historic leagues, such as the Ohio-based International League (founded in 1884). Advances in talent-spotting had reduced its need for a large reserve. The Keys, for 30 years a farm team of the Baltimore Orioles, is among the teams that have lost out.</p><p>This change was also covid-related. When MLB first proposed its plans, in late 2019, they met high-level pushback. Over a hundred House members backed a bipartisan “Save Minor League Baseball” task-force. A related Senate resolution united both Republican senators from Iowa—which stood to lose three minor-league teams, including the Clinton LumberKings—with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whose states stood to lose one each. MLB’s chances of getting its way looked dicey. But the pandemic diverted political attention and the cancellation of the minors’ season made it hard for them to get it back. MLB ended up getting everything it wanted.</p><p>Its 30 franchisees are not the only beneficiaries. Player salaries in the minors have been increased (from a pitifully low base). Travel distances have been reduced. To its credit, MLB has meanwhile helped most of the teams it dropped find another league. The Keys and its recent opponents, the West Virginia Black Bears, are among half a dozen that have formed a new league to showcase top college players ahead of the MLB draft in July. It should also be said that, while the diehards in Section 107 were livid at being junked by the Orioles, few other Keys fans seemed to care. Most minor-league watchers, having little connection to the players, come along for some baseball-themed fun. “It’s a great place to bring the kids, but I couldn’t say who’s playing,” said Dan, a regular attendee, sitting with his brother Leel, a thickly-bearded trucker.</p><p>Nonetheless, MLB has dealt a heavy blow to baseball’s regional infrastructure and traditions. Four of the affected teams have ceased operations—including another in western Maryland, the Hagerstown Suns. More will follow. The Keys will play half as many games as before, but even after shedding staff will not halve their costs. Of the 202 teams that have played in independent leagues over the past 30 years, almost half failed within four years.</p><p>In a minor key<br>This is a gloomy development, and not only for baseball fans. Politicians in both parties talk a lot about improving capitalism by righting regional imbalances, respecting place and communities, restraining monopolistic fat cats and so forth. It can be hard to take such talk seriously. It is even harder now, after they failed to protect the national pastime, as represented by the Frederick Keys, 41 other cherished local teams and their fans, against the cost-cutting of a sports monopoly that rakes in well over $10bn a year.</p>]]></content>

Amazon’s near-death experience was part of the dotcom crash that exposed Silicon Valley’s hubris and, along with the $14bn fraud at Enron, shattered confidence in American business. China, meanwhile, was struggling to privatise its creaking state-owned firms, and there was little sign that it could create a culture of entrepreneurship. Instead the bright hope was in Europe, where a new single currency promised to catalyse a giant business-friendly integrated market.</p><p>Creative destruction often makes predictions look silly, but even by these standards the post-pandemic business world is dramatically different from what you might have expected two decades ago. Tech firms comprise a quarter of the global stockmarket and the geographic mix has become strikingly lopsided. America and, increasingly, China are ascendant, accounting for 76 of the world’s 100 most valuable firms. Europe’s tally has fallen from 41 in 2000 to 15 today.</p><p>This imbalance in large part reflects American and Chinese skill, and complacency in Europe and elsewhere. It raises two giant questions: why has it come about? And can it last?</p><p>In themselves, big companies are no better than small ones. Japan Inc’s status soared in the 1980s only to collapse. Big firms can be a sign of success but also of sloth. Saudi Aramco, the world’s second-most-valuable firm, is not so much a $2trn symbol of vigour as of a desert kingdom’s dangerous dependency on fossil fuels. Even so, the right sort of giant company is a sign of a healthy business ecology in which big, efficient firms are created and constantly swept away by competition. It is the secret to raising long-run living standards.</p><p>One way of capturing the dominance of America and China is to compare their share of world output with their share of business activity (defined as the average of their share of global stockmarket capitalisation, public-offering proceeds, venture-capital funding, “unicorns”—or larger private startups, and the world’s biggest 100 firms). By this yardstick America accounts for 24% of global gdp, but 48% of business activity. China accounts for 18% of gdp, and 20% of business. Other countries, with 77% of the world’s people, punch well below their weight.</p><p>Part of the explanation is Europe’s squandered opportunity. Political meddling and the debt crisis in 2010-12 have stalled the continent’s economic integration. Firms there largely failed to anticipate the shift towards the intangible economy. Europe has no startups to rival Amazon or Google. But other countries have struggled, too. A decade ago Brazil, Mexico and India were poised to create a large cohort of global firms. Few have emerged.</p><p>Instead, only America and China have been able to marshal the process of creative destruction. Of the 19 firms created in the past 25 years that are now worth over $100bn, nine are in America and eight in China. Europe has none. Even as mature tech giants like Apple and Alibaba try to entrench their dominance, a new set of tech firms including Snap, PayPal, Meituan and Pinduoduo are reaching critical mass. The pandemic has seen a burst of energy in America and China and a boom in fundraising. Firms from the two countries dominate the frontier of new technologies such as fintech and electric cars.</p><p>The magic formula has many ingredients. A vast home market helps firms achieve scale quickly. Deep capital markets, networks of venture capitalists and top universities keep the startup pipeline full. There is a culture that exalts entrepreneurs. China’s tycoons boast of their “996” work ethic: 9am to 9pm, six days a week. Elon Musk sleeps on Tesla’s factory floor. Above all politics supports creative destruction. America has long tolerated more disruption than cosy Europe. After 2000, China’s rulers let entrepreneurs run riot and laid off 8m workers at state firms.</p><p>The recent erosion of this political consensus in both countries is one reason this dominance could prove unsustainable. Americans are worried about national decline, as well as low wages and monopolies (roughly a quarter of the s&amp;p 500 index merits antitrust scrutiny, we estimated in 2018). The Economist supports the Biden administration’s aim to promote competition and expand the social safety-net to protect workers hurt by disruption. But the danger is that America continues to drift towards protectionism, industrial policy and, on the left, punitive taxes on capital, that dampen its business vim.</p><p>In China President Xi Jinping sees big private firms as a threat to the Communist Party’s power and social stability. The cowing of tycoons began last year with Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba, and has since spread to the bosses of three other big tech firms. As party officials seek to “guide” incumbent private firms in order to achieve policy goals, such as national self-sufficiency in some technologies, they are also more likely to protect them from freewheeling competitors.</p><p>The more America and China intervene, the more the rest of the world should worry about the lopsided geography of global business. In theory the nationality of profit-seeking firms does not matter: as long as they sell competitive products and create jobs, who cares? But if firms are swayed by governments at home, the calculus changes.</p><p>As globalisation unwinds, rows are already erupting over where multinational firms produce vaccines, set digital rules and pay taxes. European hopes of being a regulatory superpower may become a figleaf for protectionism. Others with less clout may erect barriers. To assert its sovereignty, India has banned Chinese social media and hobbled American e-commerce firms. That is the worst of both worlds, depriving local consumers of global innovations and creating barriers that make it even harder for local firms to achieve scale.</p><p>It’s the acorns, not the oaks<br>It would be a tragedy if only two countries in the world proved capable of sustaining a process of creative destruction at scale. But it would be even worse if they turned away from it, and other places admitted defeat and put up barricades. The best gauge of success will be if in 20 years’ time the list of the world’s biggest companies looks absolutely nothing like today’s. </p><p><a id="getting-rid-of-binyamin-netanyahu-would-help-israel-clean-up-its-politics"></a></p><h1 id="Getting-rid-of-Binyamin-Netanyahu-would-help-Israel-clean-up-its-politics"><a href="#Getting-rid-of-Binyamin-Netanyahu-would-help-Israel-clean-up-its-politics" class="headerlink" title="Getting rid of Binyamin Netanyahu would help Israel clean up its politics"></a>Getting rid of Binyamin Netanyahu would help Israel clean up its politics</h1><p>But he won’t easily give up his office to Naftali Bennett</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Never before has Binyamin Netanyahu’s hold on the premiership of Israel looked so weak. On June 2nd his opponents, led by Naftali Bennett (pictured) and Yair Lapid, agreed to form a government that excludes the man who has dominated his country’s politics for the past 12 years. The only thing left is for the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) to hold a confidence vote. Mr Netanyahu will do his utmost to sabotage it. But if he fails, his long reign will be over.</p><p>“King Bibi” has overseen a flourishing high-tech economy and one of the world’s best covid-19 vaccination campaigns. He has made peace with several Arab states and kept Israel safe, notwithstanding a recent war in Gaza. Many of his policies are now generally accepted, even by the politicians pushing him out.</p><p>Yet he also sowed division, mixing nationalism, chauvinism and resentment of elites in order to win elections. He clung to power even after being charged with corruption. And when threatened he has lashed out at anyone in his way. The press, the judiciary, the police—all were part of a “witch hunt” aimed at bringing him down, he said.</p><p>If Mr Netanyahu stays, it will drag a weary electorate to the polls for a fifth time since 2019. If he goes, it may help heal Israeli politics. True, his Likud party is still the largest in the Knesset, and his nationalist and religious base remains an electoral force. But he has been a uniquely talented demagogue, eloquent and ruthless in equal measure. Though he will remain on the scene (and surely plot his revenge), his removal from the top job makes the political mood in Israel a little less toxic. Moreover, his prosecution and political comeuppance are proof that Israel’s institutions have held firm in the face of his assault.</p><p>Mr Netanyahu, though, has shown up Israel’s vulnerabilities. The next government must fix them. That will not be easy, as the parties in the coalition do not agree on much. Wisely, Mr Bennett, who would become prime minister, has set expectations low. “We will focus on what can be done, instead of arguing over what is impossible,” he says. A budget is a priority, since Israel has not had one in two years. But the new team should also focus on governance—and start by closing the loophole that lets a person under indictment serve as prime minister.</p><p>Other steps might include depoliticising the police, whose aggressive tactics helped spark riots inside Israel that culminated in Palestinians firing rockets into Israel from Gaza. Splitting the job of attorney-general, so that one person is not both chief prosecutor and legal counsel to the government, is another good idea. At some point a conversation should be had about the Supreme Court, which has great power and little accountability.</p><p>Reforms will be difficult. But tackling any of these problems would have been impossible under Mr Netanyahu, who used the legal system as a bogeyman. His reliance on the ultra-Orthodox also meant that civil marriage remains illegal and public services closed on the Sabbath, although most Israelis favour liberalising such things.</p><p>The new coalition includes an Arab party, but little progress is likely with the Palestinians. Still, small steps are possible, such as increasing funding in Arab parts of Israel and alleviating the suffering in the occupied territories and in Gaza. “Everyone will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams,” says Mr Bennett, an ardent supporter of the settler movement. A government grounded in reality? That doesn’t sound so bad. </p><p><a id="someone-has-to-foot-the-bill-for-empty-offices"></a></p><h1 id="Someone-has-to-foot-the-bill-for-empty-offices"><a href="#Someone-has-to-foot-the-bill-for-empty-offices" class="headerlink" title="Someone has to foot the bill for empty offices"></a>Someone has to foot the bill for empty offices</h1><p>Even small drops in occupancy rates will have a big effect on rents and prices</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In recent weeks diversity at work has taken on a new meaning. As vaccination progresses in the rich world and restrictions ease, some huge office tenants, such as Goldman Sachs, a bank, want staff back full-time, while others, like Citigroup, a rival, expect some employees never to set foot in a central business district again. Behind the posturing, a consensus is slowly emerging that white-collar desk-warriors should be allowed to stay at home more often post covid-19—and that many probably will. Office landlords, however, and those who bankroll them, continue to pretend that no storm is coming. With billions of dollars sunk in undesirable buildings, they face a reckoning.</p><p>Office bulls rest their case on two pillars. One is to argue that recent evidence shows pandemic-induced disruptions are superficial and temporary. Offices have been spared the carnage that lockdowns have inflicted on other kinds of commercial property, such as restaurants and shops. Even as rent collections plummeted elsewhere, most corporate tenants have continued to pay on time. Debt delinquencies remain a rarity, and prices paid for floor space in global cities have held up. No matter that most open spaces remain eerily silent. Developers report rises in viewings and lettings, and investors have already pledged billions of dollars to new projects.</p><p>The other strut of the bulls’ argument involves heroic predictions about the future of work. Workers have missed water coolers so much, they say, that most are bound to flock back. Die-hard sofa-surfers can be persuaded back to the office with new rooftop pools, pet-friendly concierges and Michelin-starred canteens. Even if some skip a few days a week, the need to space out desks in an era of pandemics, and rising appetite for brainstorming pods after a year of dreary Zoom calls, should keep demand for office space constant. And even if it does not, unwanted space can always be salvaged by, for instance, converting it into industrial-chic lofts or logistics centres.</p><p>Such optimism is at best deluded, at worst dishonest. It is too early to tell if offices have avoided the pain that months of social distancing have caused in other industries. Government help, lenient banks and central-bank largesse may have postponed delinquencies and distressed sales. Corporate tenants are locked into long-term leases which have yet to expire, and may not be renewed. Transaction prices are a poor gauge of the market’s health: because buyers and sellers cannot agree on terms there have been few sales. In some countries new covid-19 variants may prompt restrictions, delaying a full reopening.</p><p>Even small drops in long-run occupancy rates will have a big effect on rents and prices. The imf reckons a rise in vacancy rates of five percentage points in all commercial property would cause valuations to fall by 15% over five years. Fitch, a rating agency, says that if workers in America do not commute at least three days a week, valuations could tumble by over half.</p><p>Given that Moody’s, a rival, predicts a fifth of the country’s offices will be empty by 2022, landlords may have to brace themselves for worse. Uncertainty is compounded by the indecision of many firms. Many still have to make their mind up about hybrid working, which may yet become a new norm.</p><p>Abstract debates about aggregate demand hide the fact that property pain will not be evenly shared. As firms seek to lure talent and foster teamwork by revamping their hqs, snazzy offices in city centres will remain in demand (though making them fancier, healthier and greener will cost the landlords dearly).</p><p>Yet they are outnumbered by old and poorly ventilated blocks which will struggle to lure staff and therefore tenants. Upgrading or converting them will often cost a fortune. At best, their owners face falling rents or sales at marked-down prices. At worst, they risk having capital tied up in stranded assets.</p><p>Cheaper office rents will help some firms. But the financial costs are immediate. Banks have lent $2.4trn to commercial property in America alone. But they have brought loan-to-value ratios down from the dizzying heights of the financial crisis. A market correction would probably slap them in the face without knocking them out. Instead, more of the bill will fall on equity holders, not least pension funds and insurers which, in their hunt for returns in an era of low interest rates, have been loading up on property for years. The sooner they admit that losses are coming, the sooner they can try to limit the damage. </p><p><a id="violent-crime-is-rising-in-american-cities-putting-criminal-justice-reform-at-risk"></a></p><h1 id="Violent-crime-is-rising-in-American-cities-putting-criminal-justice-reform-at-risk"><a href="#Violent-crime-is-rising-in-American-cities-putting-criminal-justice-reform-at-risk" class="headerlink" title="Violent crime is rising in American cities, putting criminal-justice reform at risk?"></a>Violent crime is rising in American cities, putting criminal-justice reform at risk?</h1><p>What should be done about it?</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>After george floyd’s murder a year ago, Atlanta’s mayor scolded the rioters who were smashing up parts of her city. “This is not a protest…This is chaos,” Keisha Lance Bottoms said. “If you care about this city, then go home.” The speech was so well pitched that some overexcited pundits wondered whether she might one day run for president. One year on, Ms Lance Bottoms has declined even to run for re-election as mayor, in part because Atlanta is suffering from a violent-crime wave which she has been unable to calm. One affluent neighbourhood is keen to secede from the city altogether.</p><p>What is true in Atlanta is also true in other American cities. Property crimes are down, but violent crime has risen. Murders increased by about 30% between 2019 and 2020, a rise that shows little sign of slowing. This change puts at risk what has been perhaps the most benign social trend in America so far this century: the great crime decline. It also threatens liberal reforms, designed to reduce the prison population and to rethink policing, which have spread across much of the United States in the past decade.</p><p>Arguments for criminal-justice and police reform are easier to make when crime is falling, as it had been for 25 years. When voters are fearful, they become more receptive to punitive policies. The origins of America’s high incarceration rate, which stands at 700 inmates per 100,000, compared with 140 in Britain and 78 in Germany, lie in the crime wave that lasted from the 1960s to the 1990s. A new crime wave could result in a repeat.</p><p>Meanwhile, reformers will discover that, if they have nothing to say about how to tackle rising crime, they will not be trusted to run the city and county offices that control America’s decentralised justice system. Ms Lance Bottoms is not alone. In other cities mayors and prosecutors who thought they would be rewarded for championing reform in the name of racial justice are finding out that voters prize safety more.</p><p>What, then, should be done? The causes of today’s spike in murders are unclear, but probably stem from a mixture of pandemic-related stresses to both civilians and police, rising gun sales and reticence among police after the protests inspired by Mr Floyd’s death. Police forces say they have not pulled back from violent neighbourhoods for fear of inflaming tensions. But a similar murder spike in Baltimore after protests against a high-profile police killing in 2015 suggests otherwise. Mistrust between the police and those they are policing is bad for crime statistics. Without co-operation, murders become hard to solve, and unsolved murders lead to retaliatory killings.</p><p>Part of the answer lies in restoring that trust by promoting community policing and hiring more officers. “Defund the police” is one of the most counterproductive political slogans of recent times and should be cast aside. People in high-crime neighbourhoods want accountable, effective policing, not the abolition of police forces. Reforming police practices, which should remain a priority, will be more palatable if budgets are not being slashed at the same time.</p><p>If locking people up eliminated crime, America would already have eradicated it. The link between crime and incarceration is weak. But more imprisonment may be coming unless mayors, prosecutors and the police bring the killing spree under control. If Mr Floyd’s legacy was a return to mass incarceration and more thuggish policing, it would be to pile one tragedy on another. </p><p><a id="jair-bolsonaro-is-not-the-only-reason-his-country-is-in-a-ditch"></a></p><h1 id="Jair-Bolsonaro-is-not-the-only-reason-his-country-is-in-a-ditch"><a href="#Jair-Bolsonaro-is-not-the-only-reason-his-country-is-in-a-ditch" class="headerlink" title="Jair Bolsonaro is not the only reason his country is in a ditch"></a>Jair Bolsonaro is not the only reason his country is in a ditch</h1><p>The political system that helped him win office needs deep reform</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Hospitals are full, favelas echo with gunfire and a record 14.7% of workers are unemployed. Incredibly, Brazil’s economy is smaller now than it was in 2011—and it will take a lot of strong quarters like the one reported on June 1st to repair its reputation. Brazil’s death toll from covid-19 is one of the worst in the world. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, jokes that vaccines might turn people into crocodiles.</p><p>Brazil’s decline was shockingly fast. After the military dictatorship in 1964-85, the country got a new constitution that returned the army to barracks, a new currency that ended hyperinflation and social programmes that, with a commodity boom, began to ease poverty and inequality. A decade ago the country was flush with oil money and had been awarded the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. It seemed destined to flourish.</p><p>Brazil failed to seize the opportunity. As our special report this week argues, consecutive governments made three mistakes. First, they gave in to short-termism and put off liberal economic reforms. Blame for this belongs chiefly with the left-wing Workers’ Party, in office in 2003-16. It oversaw growth of 4% a year but did not invest to raise productivity. When commodity prices fell, Brazil faced one of its worst-ever recessions. The governments of Michel Temer and Mr Bolsonaro made some progress on reform, but stopped far short of what is needed.</p><p>Second, in their efforts to shield themselves from the fallout of Lava Jato, a huge anti-corruption probe, politicians have resisted reforms that would curb graft. The prosecutors and judges behind Lava Jato are partly to blame. After some were shown to have had a political agenda, their probe became bogged down in Congress and the courts.</p><p>Finally, Brazil’s political system is a millstone. State-sized districts and 30 parties in Congress make elections expensive. Even more than in other countries, politicians tend to back splashy vote-winning projects rather than worthy long-term reform. Once in office, they stick with the flawed rules that got them elected. They enjoy legal privileges that make them hard to prosecute, and a huge pot of money to help them keep power. As a result, Brazilians despise them. In 2018 only 3% said they trusted Congress “a lot”.</p><p>Disillusion paved the way for Mr Bolsonaro. A former army captain with a soft spot for the dictatorship, he persuaded voters to see his political incorrectness as a mark of authenticity. He vowed to purge corrupt politicians, crack down on crime and turbocharge the economy. He has failed on all three counts.</p><p>After passing a pensions revamp in 2019, he abandoned the agenda of his liberal economy minister, fearing that it would cost votes. Tax and public-sector reform and privatisations have stalled. Cash hand-outs helped stave off poverty early in the pandemic, but were slashed at the end of 2020 owing to rising debt. The rate of deforestation in the Amazon has soared by over 40% since he took office. He has taken a chainsaw to the environment ministry, cutting its budget and forcing out staff. His environment minister is under investigation for wood-trafficking.</p><p>On covid-19, Mr Bolsonaro has backed anti-lockdown rallies and quack cures. He sent planeloads of hydroxychloroquine to indigenous tribes. For six months he ignored offers of vaccines. One study found the delay may have cost 95,000 lives.</p><p>Rather than tackle graft, he has protected his allies. In April 2020 he fired the head of the federal police, which is investigating his sons for corruption. His justice minister quit, accusing him of obstruction of justice. Days earlier, Mr Bolsonaro had threatened the independence of the Supreme Court. In February his attorney-general shut down the Lava Jato task-force.</p><p>Brazilian democracy is more fragile than at any time since the end of the dictatorship. In March Mr Bolsonaro fired the defence minister, who reportedly refused to send the army into the streets to force businesses to reopen. If he loses re-election in 2022, some think he may not accept the result. He has cast doubt on electronic voting, passed decrees to “arm the public” and boasted that “only God” will remove him.</p><p>Actually, Brazil’s Congress could do the job without divine intervention. His conduct probably qualifies as impeachable, including “crimes of responsibility” such as urging people to defy lockdowns, ignoring vaccine offers and firing officials to shield his sons. Congress has received 118 impeachment petitions. Tens of thousands rallied on May 29th to demand his ejection.</p><p>For now, he has enough support in Congress to block impeachment. Besides, the vice-president, who would take over, is a general who is also nostalgic for military rule. The last time Congress impeached a president, Dilma Rousseff in 2016 for hiding the size of the budget deficit, it split the country. Mr Bolsonaro would cast himself as a martyr. Many of his supporters are armed.</p><p>In the long run, as well as replacing Mr Bolsonaro, Brazil must deal with the cynicism and despair that got him elected, by tackling chronic low growth and inequality. That will require dramatic reform. Yet the very resilience that has protected Brazil’s institutions from the predations of a populist also makes them resistant to beneficial change.</p><p>The actions required are daunting. Above all, the government needs to serve the public rather than itself. That means reducing the privileges of public-sector workers, which eat up an unsustainable share of government spending. Politicians must not spare themselves either. Office holders should have fewer legal protections. They should shake up the electoral and party systems to let new blood into Congress.</p><p>The next government must fight corruption without bias, restrain wasteful spending, and boost competitiveness. A crackdown in the Amazon should go hand-in-hand with economic alternatives to deforestation. Otherwise, sooner or later, new Bolsonaros will emerge.</p><p>A long journey ahead<br>Barring Mr Bolsonaro’s impeachment, Brazil’s fate will probably be decided by voters next year. His rivals should offer solutions rather than peddle nostalgia. His successor will inherit a damaged and divided country. Unfortunately, the rot goes much deeper than a single man.</p><p><a id="briefing---europe-is-now-a-corporate-also-ran-can-it-recover-its-footing"></a></p><h1 id="Briefing-—Europe-is-now-a-corporate-also-ran-Can-it-recover-its-footing"><a href="#Briefing-—Europe-is-now-a-corporate-also-ran-Can-it-recover-its-footing" class="headerlink" title="(Briefing)—Europe is now a corporate also-ran.

Can it recover its footing?</h1><p>American and Chinese businesses have left their European counterparts in the dust</p><p>来源：2021-06-05 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 1984 a besuited 20-something American executive on a visit to France offered Europeans a few tips for corporate success. Entrepreneurs needed to be given a second chance if they failed and government bureaucrats made for lousy investors, he told a television interviewer. His advice was sage. But European companies ruled the global corporate roost alongside those of America and, occasionally, Japan. Why should they take advice from this uppity Californian newcomer?</p><p>Nearly four decades later the company founded by that young upstart, Steve Jobs, is worth more than the 30 firms in the German blue-chip dax index combined. Its value is not far off that of all 40 companies in France’s cac index. Apple’s success has been notable, but it is the decline of corporate Europe that is truly striking. At the start of the 21st century 41 of the world’s 100 most valuable companies were based in Europe (including Britain and Switzerland but excluding Russia and Turkey). Today only 15 are (see chart 1).</p><p>When it comes to business, Europe used to pack a punch. In recent decades companies such as Nokia, Nestlé or bp have been among the world’s ten biggest firms by market capitalisation. Now only on occasion does Europe have a firm in the top 20 globally. In 2000 nearly a third of the combined value of the world’s 1,000 biggest listed firms was in Europe, and a quarter of their profits. In just 20 years those figures have fallen by almost half. Europe is a place for companies such as Amazon and TikTok to find customers, not a base for local firms to conquer the world.</p><p>Some of Europe’s lost stature is down to the rise of China. But American firms have reinforced their position at the vanguard of global business. European ones, alongside those from Japan, have not. In 2000 Europe had a share of corporate wealth commensurate with its roughly one-third of the world economy. That is no longer true (see chart 2).</p><p>Some Europeans might ask: et alors? Many on the continent are ambivalent about big business, preferring a dense collection of midsized firms, such as the German Mittelstand, to corporate goliaths. But if it continues, the waning of Europe’s business will bring consequences. Big firms invest in innovation, which boosts economic growth. Left to regulate only foreign groups, Europe’s ability to shape global business norms—on privacy, say, or the uses of artificial intelligence—will look weak. European policymakers’ cries for “strategic autonomy” will come to nothing without corporate backing.</p><p>Plenty of European companies still make consumers swoon. lvmh of France flogs Louis Vuitton handbags from Beijing to Buenos Aires; German cars and Swiss pharmaceuticals are sought-after around the world; and homes are stocked with products made by Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch giant and ikea, a Swedish forest-feller. But look at who dominates the global corporate economy, and Europe’s geopolitical rivals now prevail.</p><p>When it comes to big business, America, the spiritual home of free-market capitalism, has been on top for decades. It is the ascent of Asia that has rejigged the global corporate landscape. China’s rapid economic growth has spawned corporate titans to match. Over 160 of the world’s 1,000 most valuable firms are now Chinese, a fourfold rise in two decades.</p><p>Ne me quitte pas<br>Assuming that Chinese firms would have gate-crashed the Fortune Global 500, which ranks the world’s biggest companies by revenue, in relative terms it was inevitable that some Western firms would be nudged out of the global elite. That left European firms vying with American ones to stay dominant. It is in this tussle that Europe has fallen by the wayside. In 2000 the 100 biggest firms in Europe were worth $4.6trn, rising to $8.9trn now. America’s equivalent companies started at $7.4trn but are now worth $26trn. (China’s top 100 firms are worth $8.8trn.)</p><p>How did European companies fall behind their American competitors? The first reason is that its firms seem to have been outmanaged. Look at firms competing in the same sector over the past 20 years, and incumbent American companies more often than not went on to churn out bigger profits and are better positioned for future success than their European counterparts.</p><p>There are many exceptions to this rule: Siemens of Germany has outshone its industrial rival General Electric, for example, and Airbus, based in France, has had fewer problems of late putting jets together than Boeing, its American foe. But by and large it has been better to bet on Nike of America over Adidas of Germany; JPMorgan Chase in New York over Credit Suisse in Zurich, or America’s Walmart over France’s Carrefour. Their advantage in terms of profits and sales growth is often small, but compounds over time.</p><p>A second reason Europe fell behind in recent decades is that its biggest firms are in the wrong industries. The sectors European firms dominated 20 years ago, such as insurance or telecoms, have grown at a glacial pace. Even if European firms did well, as many did, they mattered less as the world moved on. America, by contrast, had already made significant inroads into software and e-commerce, industries that would soon redefine the global economy and generate trillion-dollar valuations.</p><p>The third, and most striking, reason Europe has fallen behind is the lack of newly created firms in its blue-chip indices. Many of the biggest companies in America, such as Amazon, Netflix, Tesla or Facebook, are young enough to be run by their founders. In Europe old names prevail.</p><p>Of the world’s 142 listed firms worth over $100bn, 43 were set up from scratch in the past half-century, 27 in America and ten in China. Only one was in Europe: sap, a German software group founded in 1972. Half of Europe’s richest ten billionaires inherited fortunes spawned long ago; in America nine of the top ten are wealthy solely because of companies they founded.</p><p>Many—but by no means all—of the American newcomers are in tech. That has led policymakers and business leaders in Europe to make light of the problem. The failure by France or Germany to build big new firms is regrettable, they concede, but America has merely stolen a march in the consumer-internet realm. Silicon Valley was the right place to be at the right time to build this new generation of firms: a felicitous nexus of universities and research institutes, venture capital and America’s consumer-first reflexes. When that bubble bursts, new business models will emerge that Europe will be ready to seize.</p><p>It’s more fun to compute<br>In fact, the absence of European tech giants is symptomatic of an entrepreneurial deficiency that transcends the world of apps and clicks. America’s nous at creating new companies—and Europe’s failure to match it—extends beyond Silicon Valley, argues Thomas Philippon of New York University.</p><p>A global chain of cafés might have been expected to hail from Italy, home of the espresso and barista. Instead Starbucks has overrun the world, despite America’s reputation for insipid coffee. A green car giant should have emerged from Europe, which has a proud engineering tradition and is at the forefront of environmental regulation. Yet it is an American newcomer, Tesla, that is now worth roughly as much as every other American and European carmaker combined. Why could Britain’s or Switzerland’s storied financiers not have created an asset-management giant to dominate the markets? Today it is BlackRock, set up in 1988, which manages $9trn of global investments from New York.</p><p>Each of these has found success in its own way. But a combination of factors helped propel them to global corporate superstardom. The ability to raise ample capital, from private investors to large pension funds, is a recurring theme in America that is all too often missing in Europe. So too is the belief that a company that develops a better product will, eventually, displace incumbents, however powerful.</p><p>The balance is unlikely to shift in Europe’s favour any time soon. The pipeline to become the world’s next trillion-dollar company is stuffed with firms from America and China, not Britain or Spain. According to PitchBook, a data provider, in the past decade venture capitalists have backed 661 companies that went on to be worth over $1bn. Only 78 of these “unicorns” are in Europe, worth 8% of the 661 firms’ over-$2.5trn total.</p><p>Disentangling the cause of Europe’s corporate malaise from its consequences is tricky. One reason frequently cited is the economy: how could European companies be expected to do well when the European economy fared so poorly since 2000? And indeed its share of global gdp has trended down (see chart 3) as emerging markets have grown faster. But that offers only a partial explanation.</p><p>In the past 20 years, in absolute terms Europe has added as much additional economic output as America—roughly $10trn each. (China added $14trn by growing at a faster rate but from a smaller base.) That is partly because of Europe’s larger population. European gdp per head is about two-thirds that of America. The figure has not fallen in the past 20 years thanks mostly to poorer eastern Europeans getting closer to Western income levels.</p><p>Looking at European gdp as a whole assumes firms there have access to the entire economic zone. Too often they do not. In theory the eu offers its firms and citizens a “single market” stretching across much of the continent (though no longer to Britain, one of the biggest economies). In practice it is a part-built edifice. It is still fiddly for a bank in Portugal to offer services in Finland—much harder than for a Californian bank to expand to Texas.</p><p>Beyond linguistic and cultural differences, legal complexities often get in the way. “When [European] companies think of their home market, they usually think of their home country, not of Europe,” says Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of Volvo, a Swedish lorry maker, and of the European Round Table for Industry, which represents large companies.</p><p>These internal barriers mean Europe has many smaller firms operating at national, not continental, scale. Each country tends to have its own banks, utilities, airlines and supermarkets. (Europe has over 100 mobile operators, compared with a handful in America or China.) These lack the economies of scale and opportunities to grow quickly enjoyed by firms plying the American or Chinese markets.</p><p>In the absence of easy opportunities at home, European firms have expanded overseas more zealously than their American counterparts. Firms in richer countries in Europe, the source of most of its multinationals, now generate over half their income elsewhere, up from just over a quarter in 1997, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. That includes around a third from poor countries; large German firms now sell more to emerging markets than they do domestically. American groups generate over 70% of their income locally. That can make managing European companies a case of constantly putting out fires in far-flung subsidiaries.</p><p>At home, European companies complain that they face a less favourable business environment. Europe’s brand of capitalism is often softened by a stronger role for unions. That has its allure, as workers toil shorter hours and enjoy greater job security. It also means higher labour costs. The political protection afforded businesses—from hostile takeovers, say, which are rare in mainland Europe—is one reason their financial results are underwhelming.</p><p>Europe’s smaller firms now find themselves competing against global behemoths with inbuilt advantages. Large firms can afford to buy and try new technology, borrow at cheaper rates and absorb fixed costs more efficiently. They tend to spend relatively more on research and development. The dearth of big companies helps explain why European spending on research, at 2.1% of gdp, is below the average of the oecd, a group of mostly rich nations.</p><p>Que reste-t-il de nos amours?<br>Even as Europe has fallen out of business league tables, it has continued to play a role as a global regulator. Sometimes that has seemed its main contribution to the global business landscape: look at rules on privacy or combating climate change. Because standards set by the European Commission are often the most stringent in the world, and businesses want to build a single set of products for all markets globally, they often end up applying across the world. But eu rulemaking that applies in effect only to foreign firms—as does much of the tech regulation devised in Brussels—has increasingly been attacked as covert protectionism. Currently a rulemaker, Europe may risk losing that position.</p><p>European policymakers are well aware of Europe’s relative decline. They point to mitigating factors. Some corporate giants in America profit from areas which in Europe are the responsibility of the state—running hospitals or railways. Others such as airlines and mobile carriers are monopolies that bilk customers. And can profits or market capitalisation truly reflect the value of a company to society?</p><p>There has also been a return to European dirigiste reflexes. If the private sector has proved unable to grow firms that are a match for global titans, perhaps politicians can help? More overt intervention by the public sector in the economy—both helping European firms and stymieing their competitors—was increasing before covid-19. The pandemic has turbocharged it.</p><p>Under the banner of promoting Europe’s “strategic autonomy”, rules preventing takeovers of some European firms by foreign rivals have been bolstered. Proposals are being developed to hamper foreign companies backed by non-eu governments who wish to do business in Europe—a measure plainly aimed at China. Talk has grown of a “carbon border tax” to ensure European firms are not at a disadvantage when competing against challengers from places with less ambitious climate-protection policies.</p><p>France and Germany are among those who have demanded the eu stop blocking favoured mergers of big European firms into pan-continental champions, despite the scepticism of antitrust regulators. Politicians are willing to shovel public money into industry in the hope of guiding its priorities—the idea of “picking winners”, popular in the 1970s, has made a comeback. Myriad state-backed investments are happening in green technologies. France has revived the position of “high commissioner for planning”. Across the continent public funds are being invested in everything from startups to large listed firms.</p><p>Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?<br>Europe’s boosters see plenty of corporate life left there. From utilities to power majors, firms in Europe have gone further than others in greening themselves. Those in other parts of the world will have to follow suit at some point. European universities remain world-class. But Europe also has unique challenges. One is demography: the old continent is living up to its name. There are more over-65s than under-15s nowadays and populists across the eu make it hard to boost immigration.</p><p>That leaves few levers to pull to help Europe’s firms compete globally. The most obvious, deepening the single market, has fallen off the political agenda. Helping law firms and software designers sell across the continent seamlessly lacks the pizzazz of picking industrial winners. But stiffening competition in Europe is key to creating firms fit for corporate glory. The path to global business begins at home. </p>]]></content>

We analyse their capital-expenditure plans</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As lockdowns lift across the rich world, people are going out and spending. Australia’s restaurants have been crammed for months. America’s shopping malls are filled with people splurging stimulus cheques. Cinemas in Britain, which were allowed to reopen in mid-May, are packed once again. Yet behind the scenes another, potentially more significant, spending bonanza is just beginning.</p><p>Businesses are starting to invest in huge numbers. In America capital spending (or capex) by companies is rising at an annual rate of 15%, both on the hard stuff, such as machines and factories, and intangibles, like software. Firms in other parts of the world are also ramping up spending. Forecasts for business investment have never looked so rosy. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, a bank, predict a “red-hot capex cycle”. Overall global investment, they reckon, will soar to 121% of pre-recession levels by the end of 2022 (see chart 1). Oxford Economics, a consultancy, argues that “the time looks right for a boom in capex”, while ihs Markit, a research firm, forecasts that global real fixed investment will rise by more than 6% this year.</p><p>Today’s optimism marks quite a change from the pre-pandemic norm. In America gross domestic business investment, as a share of gdp, had been sluggish since the early 1980s. After the financial crisis of 2007-09 it took more than two years for global investment, in real terms, to regain its previous peak. By contrast, although investment fell more steeply at the start of the pandemic, it has been quicker to bounce back this time. The prospect of surging capex holds out promise that the global economy will not face a repeat of the 2010s, when growth in productivity and gdp stayed stubbornly below pre-crisis trends. Investment in new products, technologies and business practices is, after all, the foundation for higher incomes and a better quality of life. So what is behind the capex cheer—and could it last?</p><p>To understand why analysts are so upbeat, consider the firms included in the s&amp; p 500, America’s main stockmarket index. Together they account for about one dollar in seven of total rich-world corporate capital formation. In a recent report Bank of America analyses these companies’ earnings calls since 2006, and concludes that executives are at their most bullish about capex. The Economist has looked at the biggest 25 non-financial firms in the s&amp; p 500 and found that analysts’ expectations for capex in 2021 have risen by 10% in the past year.</p><p>For now the investment recovery is concentrated in a few industries. We find that global tech firms are expected to boost capex by 42% this year, relative to 2019. Apple will invest $430bn in America over a five-year period, an upgrade of 20% on previous plans. Taiwan’s tsmc, the world’s largest semiconductor-maker, recently announced that it would invest $100bn over the next three years in manufacturing. Analysts reckon that Samsung’s capex will rise by 13% this year, having gone up by 45% in 2020.</p><p>Tech companies are spending so freely in part because the pandemic has created new demands. More shopping happens online. Remote work is on the rise. New equipment and software is needed for these to run smoothly. Recent research by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis and Yulia Zhestkova of the University of Chicago finds a big rise in the share of patent filings for work-from-home technologies. ubs, another bank, reckons that shipments of computers for commercial use will rise by nearly 10% this year, an acceleration even over the last.</p><p>Tech firms are not the only enthusiastic spenders. Firms in the s&amp; p 500 that focus on discretionary consumer spending boosted capex by 36% year-on-year in the first quarter. Companies such as Target and Walmart, two retailers, are trying to keep up with the online giants that are eating their lunch. Marks &amp; Spencer, an august British retailer, recently announced that it had launched 46 new websites in overseas markets from Iceland to Uzbekistan.</p><p>Other retailers are spending frantically to expand capacity, having been caught out by the surge in household spending. Everything from sofas to hot tubs is in short supply. Earlier this year Peloton announced “substantial incremental investments” in expediting the transport of its exercise bikes from Taiwan. Maersk, a shipping firm, recently said it would buy more containers to ease bottlenecks. The global order-book for enormous container ships has risen from 9% of the existing fleet, in October, to over 15% in April.</p><p>The big question is whether the emerging capex boom augurs a broad and lasting shift away from the weakness of the 2010s, or is simply an enthusiastic but temporary response to reopening. Not everyone is boosting capex: our analysis suggests that about half of the companies in the s&amp; p 500 are not expected to invest more in 2021 than they did in 2019. Global oil-and-gas firms are cutting back by a tenth relative to pre-pandemic levels, possibly in response to lower expected demand for their planet-warming fare. Airline operators are also dialling down spending, perhaps because they expect it to be a while before people can travel freely again. Many executives, including those from raw-materials and industrial-goods firms, continue to preach capital discipline. It may be quite a leap for them to go from a decade of austerity to boom time.</p><p>Another worry is the trend towards greater consolidation in industries from hotels to mining, which seems unlikely to have been reversed by covid-19. Research by the imf suggests that companies with market power may be less keen on investing. In the five years before the pandemic, for instance, American business investment in hotels was barely higher than it was in the five years before the financial crisis, even though demand was far higher.</p><p>Set against that, though, economic conditions today could convince reluctant companies to loosen the purse-strings. In contrast to the post-financial-crisis period, households have a lot of savings to spend. A more decisive fiscal and monetary response this time has also allowed firms to load up on cash (see chart 2). Bond issuance by investment-grade-rated American companies jumped to a record $1.7trn in 2020, up from $1.1trn in 2019, according to s&amp; p Global Market Intelligence, a research outfit.</p><p>Moreover, the economic reallocation provoked by covid-19, and its investment implications, will be felt for some time. Managers in certain industries, especially semiconductors, already accept that they went into the pandemic with too little spare capacity, and are promising multi-year projects to make up for it. Perhaps most important, the pandemic is leading to an era of greater technological optimism. The rapid deployment of entirely new business models when covid-19 struck, not to mention vaccine discovery, may have reminded bosses of the payoff to investing. All that might explain why the expectations for capex by s&amp;p 500 firms in 2022 are even more ambitious than those for this year. The investment boom may only be getting started. </p><p><a id="which-euro-zone-economies-are-bouncing-back-quickest"></a></p><h1 id="Which-euro-zone-economies-are-bouncing-back-quickest"><a href="#Which-euro-zone-economies-are-bouncing-back-quickest" class="headerlink" title="Which euro-zone economies are bouncing back quickest?"></a>Which euro-zone economies are bouncing back quickest?</h1><p>Activity is surging as lockdowns end. But the recovery will be unequal</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Knocked back by several bouts of covid-19, Europe’s economy is now finding its feet. Its vaccination drive is charging ahead, and lockdown restrictions are easing. On May 17th Italy’s curfew moved from 10pm to 11pm, and on May 19th Parisians were allowed to return to their beloved cafés, after six months without. German companies are at their most optimistic in two years, according to figures released on May 25th, and wider economic sentiment is surging. The relief is widespread. The recovery will be less so.</p><p>Europe went into the covid-19 crisis with scars still unhealed, as northern countries, such as Germany, outperformed southern ones, such as Spain and Italy. The pandemic rubbed salt in the wounds. Between the final quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 household consumption in Spain and Italy fell by 30% and 20% respectively, compared with just 11% in Germany. Punishing lockdowns and a drought in tourist revenues have prolonged the pain. By the end of 2020, consumption in Italy and in Spain was more than a tenth below its pre-crisis peak, compared with a shortfall of 6% in Germany and 7% in France.</p><p>Some indicators suggest that the worst-hit countries are bouncing back faster. Mobility data from Google from mid-May suggest that travel for recreation and retail was returning to normal more quickly in Italy and Spain than in France and Germany, perhaps because they reopened earlier. Others indicate divergence. Figures from Indeed, a job-search platform, suggest that the recovery in vacancies posted by employers in Italy is well ahead of those in France and Germany, let alone Spain (see chart).</p><p>Beyond the immediate bump associated with fewer restrictions at home, three factors will influence the evenness of the recovery. The first is the extent to which external constraints ease. Looser travel restrictions are important for Spain, where revenues from tourism made up 12% of gdp before the pandemic. The strength of Germany’s industrial boom, meanwhile, relies on bottlenecks along the supply chain being resolved.</p><p>The second factor is the extent to which consumers spend their accumulated cash. Their larger piles of “excess” savings could help harder-hit countries catch up. Compared with the French and the Germans, Italians and Spaniards stashed away much more in 2020 than they did in 2019. That does not mean they will spend all of it, though. A survey of 5,000 European consumers by ubs, a bank, suggests Spanish consumers plan to splurge less than others. Given the sorry state of the labour market, that caution is hardly surprising. In March the unemployment rate was 15%, three times that in Germany.</p><p>The third factor influencing the recovery is the strength of governments’ fiscal response. A fear of divergence has already motivated the eu’s recovery fund. This will direct more cash to Italy and Spain, and could boost growth there by more than twice as much as in France and Germany, reckons s&amp;p, a rating agency. But at a meeting on May 21st-22nd economists from Bruegel, a think-tank, warned European finance ministers that they might need to go further. Given that many forecasters expect the eu not to reach its pre-pandemic level of output until 2022, another round of stimulus could help tackle the other inequalities that have arisen during the pandemic, such as the extra burdens borne by the young and the less educated.</p><p>Look beyond the immediate recovery, and the prospects for convergence seem limited. Support from the recovery fund notwithstanding, the imf’s latest forecasts suggest that Italy’s economy will shrink by 0.1% between 2019 and 2023, while Spain’s expands by a paltry 1.9%. France and Germany, meanwhile, are expected to grow by 2.9% and 3.5% respectively. Without more support, the economies that were lagging behind even before the pandemic will see their recovery slow to a crawl. </p><p><a id="the-boundary-between-crypto-and-fiat-money-is-becoming-more-permeable"></a></p><h1 id="The-boundary-between-crypto-and-fiat-money-is-becoming-more-permeable"><a href="#The-boundary-between-crypto-and-fiat-money-is-becoming-more-permeable" class="headerlink" title="The boundary between crypto and fiat money is becoming more permeable"></a>The boundary between crypto and fiat money is becoming more permeable</h1><p>Crypto may be past the point where it can be considered self-contained</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Finance has its squabbling tribes, much like the rest of society. A contest that attracts a lot of attention just now is the demographic-cum-digital divide between crypto kids and fiat dinosaurs. The crypto kids believe that blockchain-based finance is the future and a haven from the inevitable degradation of fiat money. In the opposite corner are the titanosaurs of the fiat world, the central bankers. “I’m sceptical about crypto assets, frankly, because they are dangerous,” said Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England’s boss, this week.</p><p>This is a good moment for the dinosaurs. The dollar price of bitcoin, the mainstay of crypto assets, fell from $58,000 or so in mid-May to around $33,000 in the space of a couple of weeks. The steepest part of that decline came after Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said his firm would suspend its policy of accepting bitcoin for purchases of its cars. A pledge by Chinese regulators to crack down on the mining of bitcoin gave the sell-off additional impetus.</p><p>The consequences have so far been few. Because there has been no visible collateral damage, crypto has been widely seen as a side-show in financial markets. This view is too dismissive, though. Crypto, like gold, is built on a collective belief about its value. But so to an extent are all asset prices. And crypto is moving past the point where it can be considered its own self-contained world.</p><p>To understand bitcoin’s ascent it helps to go back to the work of Thomas Schelling, a Nobel-prizewinning economist and game theorist. Schelling contended that people are often able to act tacitly in concert if they know that others are trying to do the same. Many situations throw up a clue, a “focal point”, around which people can co-ordinate without explicitly agreeing to do so. For instance, if asked to pick a positive number, people will offer a variety of responses—one, seven, 100 and so on; but if asked to choose a number that others will also select, there is a preponderant choice: the number one.</p><p>This insight applies to certain assets that lack intrinsic value. The investment case for gold, said Schelling, can best be explained as a solution to a co-ordination game. Gold bars have value because enough people tacitly agree that they do. Their value is bolstered by their scarcity, and their longevity. Willem Buiter, a prominent economist, once aptly called gold the “six-thousand-year-old bubble”. Bitcoin is newer, but similar. Yes, the technology behind it is ingenious (although Ethereum, the next-most-valuable crypto asset, arguably has the more compelling user case). And, yes, bitcoin is used in transactions, if no longer for Tesla’s cars. But its selling points are scarcity and fame. It is a natural focal point. As with gold, you can make a theoretical case that it is proof against paper-money inflation.</p><p>The latest gyrations seem to confirm that crypto is a walled garden unconnected with the rest of finance. But if you look more closely a different pattern is emerging. There is already a pathway linking crypto prices with gold. Flows into exchange-traded funds (etfs) that invest in gold started to revive just as money was flowing out of bitcoin futures and etfs, according to a recent analysis by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan Chase, a bank. That suggests that institutional investors are shifting back into gold after a flurry of interest in crypto, because bitcoin prices had risen too quickly. Viewed this way, the fall of bitcoin and the revival of gold are a relative-value trade within the broader set of inflation hedges.</p><p>Furthermore, it is hard to shake off the feeling that crypto-crashes now matter. This is the third bear market in four years, but a lot more money is now involved. The market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies tracked by a specialist website, coingecko.com, was more than $2.5trn in mid-May. A fortnight later it had fallen to $1.5trn. That is a big loss in anyone’s money. Crypto prices are creeping up again, so those losses are already being eroded. But at each new peak, the asset class looms ever larger. And a dollar lost in crypto investing is the same as a dollar that was once earned or borrowed—even if, at present, it is hard to know precisely who bears the loss.</p><p>There is something else to consider. Cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets. It is thus hard not to think of their prices as a signal of shifts in risk appetite more broadly. Beliefs matter for all sorts of asset prices, whether in dollars or bitcoin. You might be able to dismiss this crypto-crash. But the next one will be harder to ignore.</p><p><a id="what-will-it-cost-to-end-the-pandemic"></a></p><h1 id="What-will-it-cost-to-end-the-pandemic"><a href="#What-will-it-cost-to-end-the-pandemic" class="headerlink" title="What will it cost to end the pandemic?"></a>What will it cost to end the pandemic?</h1><p>$50bn, says the IMF</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On may 2nd thousands of masked nurses, doctors and others who have battled against covid-19 watched Jennifer Lopez and other stars perform in the flesh at the “vax live” concert in Los Angeles. Outside the venue, visitors could get their jab from the comfort of their own vehicles, while watching H.E.R., a singer-songwriter, perform the song “Glory” in the car park, surrounded by schoolkids stomping their feet. A live concert was possible only because many Americans (50% of adults) are now vaccinated. But a charity event of this kind was necessary only because most of the world is not.</p><p>What would it take to close the gap? In a paper published in April, Ruchir Agarwal of the imf and Tristan Reed of the World Bank argued that it might be possible to end the “acute phase” of the pandemic early next year by vaccinating 60% of the population of every country. Will there be enough shots to go round? In principle, yes. According to Airfinity, a life-sciences data firm, vaccine-makers could produce as many as 11.1bn doses this year, enough to inoculate more than 75% of the world’s population aged over five. The manufacturers themselves say they will produce many more.</p><p>Some of this capacity is already spoken for. But rich countries have hogged less of it than many people fear. Mr Agarwal and Mr Reed calculate that rich countries have placed advance orders for about 2bn courses (many of which comprise two shots). At the same time, the developing world already has dibs on more vaccines than some people assume, thanks to deals struck by organisations like the African Union and covax, a vaccine-sharing initiative. Mr Agarwal and Mr Reed calculate that 91 developing countries (with a combined population of over 2.5bn people) need to order only another 350m courses between them to vaccinate 60% of their population. India faces a bigger shortfall. But it also has the dollars and domestic manufacturing capacity to reach the target eventually.</p><p>Mr Agarwal and Gita Gopinath, the imf’s chief economist, have now turned this insight into a broader $50bn “proposal to end the covid-19 pandemic” (see chart). Only $4bn of the headline total is necessary to buy the 350m extra vaccination courses. The rest is earmarked for other tasks, such as helping countries get vaccines into people’s arms, keeping a lookout for new variants, expanding testing and treatment, and adding another 1bn doses of vaccine-making capacity next year as insurance, in case anything goes wrong. Not everything on their wishlist is costly. The two economists reckon the developing world could vaccinate almost 40% of its population by the end of 2021 if rich countries donated even half of the surplus vaccines they are likely to amass this year.</p><p>The proposal is ambitious. But circumspection will only make the problems posed by the pandemic harder to fix. Without firm commitments to buy vaccines, manufacturers will have less reason to resolve any bottlenecks in their supply chains. A scarcity of shots will encourage counterproductive bans on exports of vaccines and materials. If poor countries do not know when vaccines will arrive, they will find it harder to prepare a successful roll-out. And slow vaccination will make new variants more likely.</p><p>Conversely, an early end to the pandemic could add as much as $8trn (at market exchange rates) to global gdp spread over the next few years, according to the imf, and raise tax revenues in the rich world by $1trn. “Funding this proposal”, the authors argue, “may possibly be the highest-return public investment ever.” Glory, indeed. </p><p><a id="what-america%E2%80%99s-hot-housing-market-means-for-consumer-prices"></a></p><h1 id="What-America’s-hot-housing-market-means-for-consumer-prices"><a href="#What-America’s-hot-housing-market-means-for-consumer-prices" class="headerlink" title="What America’s hot housing market means for consumer prices"></a>What America’s hot housing market means for consumer prices</h1><p>A bounceback in rents would have a big effect on inflation statistics</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The american economy last year may have suffered its deepest downturn since the Depression, but you would not know it from house prices. The Case-Shiller national house-price index is rising at an annual rate of 13%, its fastest for more than 15 years (see chart). Lower interest rates have encouraged people to take out bigger mortgages, and trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus have let people spend more on housing.</p><p>Yet as prices have breezed ahead, rental growth, which usually follows suit, has sharply slowed. And whether rents catch up or not matters, because they play an outsize role in America’s consumer-price inflation statistics. In a recent note analysts at Goldman Sachs, a bank, ranked housing costs among their three main “upside” risks to inflation, together with wages and inflation expectations. Alan Detmeister of ubs, another bank, went further, arguing that “it is only a small exaggeration to say that there is no single variable on which global financial markets depend more this year than us rents.” The behaviour of rental inflation could influence the Federal Reserve’s decision to withdraw its support for the economy—which would in turn affect everything from the strength of America’s recovery to the valuations of an array of assets.</p><p>America’s statisticians, like those across the rich world, do not include house prices in inflation metrics: the thinking runs that house purchases are in large part an investment, rather than purely a consumption good. Instead they focus on two other measures of housing costs. One is the rents actually paid by tenants. The other is an estimate of what homeowners would need to pay in order to rent their house. Despite boomy prices, rents are rising at just 2% a year, about half the pace seen just before the pandemic.</p><p>Economists puzzle over this divergence. Americans’ growing fondness for homeownership means more competition for owner-occupied properties but less for tenancies. Renters are more likely than homeowners to have lost their jobs in the past year, and may thus have negotiated rent holidays or discounts. Some landlords in San Francisco are so desperate for new tenants that they are even offering bonuses to people who sign a lease.</p><p>Over the long run, however, economic theory suggests that rents and prices should move in tandem (ie, the ratio of house prices to rents should be stable). If rental growth catches up with prices, that could have a big effect. Rents make up one-fifth of the basket used to calculate “core” personal-consumption-expenditure (pce) inflation, which excludes food and energy—the gauge most closely watched by the Fed. If annual rent inflation rose to 4% a year—not far off where it was shortly before the pandemic—overall core inflation would rise by 0.5 percentage points.</p><p>Could this happen? As the economy recovers, landlords may hope to make up for lost time. “We expect a rental-market resurgence in 2021,” said Zillow, a property firm, in a report in December, “with rents increasing…and demand for rental housing strengthening.” A recovery in low-wage employment should boost rents: housing-cost inflation tends to rise when the unemployment rate falls. A survey by the New York Fed in April found that households expected rents to rise by 10% in the coming year, up from expectations of 5%, on average, in 2020.</p><p>Rental inflation is thus likely to rise in the coming months. But by how much is another question. There are reasons to think the price-to-rent ratio could settle at a permanently higher level. When interest rates are so low, for instance, people are willing to pay more for the right to a given stream of income. American price-to-rent ratios are higher today than in the 1980s, which coincides with declines in real interest rates.</p><p>A slower pace of housing construction may also keep price-to-rent ratios higher, suggests a new paper by Christian Hilber of the London School of Economics and Andreas Mense of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. In thriving areas where the supply of housing is constrained, buyers may be willing to bid up prices in the expectation of strong rental growth in the future. In recent years America has become worse at building new houses, in part because of tougher land-use regulations.</p><p>American price-to-rent ratios could of course adjust in another way—through prices falling, rather than rents rising. Just as share prices are more volatile than dividends, house prices are more up-and-down than rents. And Mr Detmeister’s historical analysis suggests that two-thirds of any adjustment in price-to-rent ratios tends to fall on prices. In other words, America might be able to have either a strong housing market or quiescent inflation—but not both. </p><p><a id="the-pandemic-revives-interest-in-a-morbid-french-financial-scheme"></a></p><h1 id="The-pandemic-revives-interest-in-a-morbid-French-financial-scheme"><a href="#The-pandemic-revives-interest-in-a-morbid-French-financial-scheme" class="headerlink" title="The pandemic revives interest in a morbid French financial scheme"></a>The pandemic revives interest in a morbid French financial scheme</h1><p>Viagers let you buy property upfront—while betting on a stranger’s death</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Who has not dreamed of owning a pied-à-terre in Paris, or perhaps overlooking the Mediterranean? How about betting on the timing of a perfect stranger’s death? In France you can combine the two. In sales of property en viager a buyer pays upfront for a residence while getting the keys only when the current owner dies. Covid-19 has revived interest in the morbid scheme.</p><p>The concept of viagers is nearly as old as property; rules laying out its modalities go back over a thousand years. Typically the seller gets cash for around a third of the value of the home at the time of the sale. Monthly payments from the buyer should add up to something nearer the full value of the property—assuming the seller dies at the time suggested by actuarial tables.</p><p>For sellers not afraid of tempting fate, viagers offer the chance to cash in on their homes yet stay in them, with an income to boot. That appealed all the more as covid-19 began to spread, and death rates in retirement homes soared. Specialist brokers reported a surge in enquiries as elderly people sought to remain in their homes for longer.</p><p>Even then, the estimated 5,000 viager deals signed in France every year represent less than 1% of all property sales. But the scheme’s long-expected demise never seems to come. Authorities promote it as a tax-efficient way for pensioners to cash in on rising property prices. Viagers also allow buyers to invest in property without a mortgage—the lender is, in effect, the seller-cum-tenant for life. The discount on properties sold for occupation at an unspecified time in the future is also an attraction.</p><p>Buyers of viager properties have to guess how long the kindly old grandfather on the other side of the deal has left. Ads for such sales come with descriptions of the place in question—and details of the age of the seller. Canny widows looking to cash out are known to light cigarettes ahead of visits by potential buyers to hint at their unhealthy lifestyles. All parties are aware of the industry’s freak event. In 1965 a 47-year-old notary bought a home en viager from a frail 90-year-old lady. He died 30 years later, but his widow kept making annuity payments, as the seller, Jeanne Calment, lived on to the world-beating age of 122.</p><p>Fans of viagers point out that betting on death is hardly unusual in finance: just look at the life-insurance industry. But the sinister undertones of such arrangements are hard to shake off. Some buyers have been suspected of hurrying nature along. In at least two murders currently in front of courts, authorities allege buyers did away with their tenants to gain possession of viager properties.</p><p><a id="what-it-means-to-invest-in-chinese-offshore-assets-could-be-changing"></a></p><h1 id="What-it-means-to-invest-in-Chinese-offshore-assets-could-be-changing"><a href="#What-it-means-to-invest-in-Chinese-offshore-assets-could-be-changing" class="headerlink" title="What it means to invest in Chinese offshore assets could be changing"></a>What it means to invest in Chinese offshore assets could be changing</h1><p>Enforcing cross-border claims was often futile. Perhaps for not much longer</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Dissidents, smugglers and rogue executives have been hiding out on either side of the 40km border between Hong Kong and China for generations. Despite being part of the same country since 1997, the two jurisdictions have separate legal systems with limited interaction. Chinese companies have crossed the border in droves since the 1990s to access global capital markets. Investors, trusting in Hong Kong’s independent legal system, have met them there, cash in hand. But when Chinese groups struggle to repay their debts, investors seldom attempt to chase them back over the border, where the bulk of the companies’ assets are located. Enforcing cross-border claims has been excruciatingly difficult and often futile. That could now be changing, with important consequences for creditors both at home and abroad.</p><p>Global investors have long accepted the tenuous links between their money and Chinese assets. Take, for example, the legal structures known as variable-interest entities (vies) that have been used to connect hundreds of billions of foreign investors’ dollars with Chinese-issued shares, despite having scant legal recognition in China. In the debt markets so-called keepwell deeds have thrived as a way of keeping offshore investors’ nerves under control. They are a type of promissory note that obliges parent groups to help pay back investors should an offshore subsidiary default. But no investor has ever successfully used these notes, which back some $90bn in dollar-denominated bonds, to force onshore companies to pay offshore debts. Creditor committees have been used to restructure debts that span the border. But more broadly it is rare that a Chinese court dealing with an insolvency case has recognised proceedings launched outside the mainland, including in Hong Kong.</p><p>The recent turmoil unleashed by Huarong Asset Management, a state-owned Chinese financial firm with $22bn in offshore debts, could cast a harsh glare on the disconnect between courts in China and Hong Kong. Huarong is the largest Chinese issuer of dollar-denominated debt, and the largest user of keepwell deeds. The Beijing-based group has not published its financial statements for 2020, leading to speculation that it will be restructured. Its troubles have sent yields on other state-backed debt soaring. Given the size of its borrowings and the scope of investors exposed to Huarong, a default by the group would force asset managers and hedge funds to rethink how they invest in state companies.</p><p>One question is whether keepwell deeds live up to their name. In January administrators in Beijing rejected creditors’ cross-border claims on Peking University Founder Group, a tech company linked to one of China’s top universities, because its keepwell deeds were based on English, not Chinese, law. The decision does not bode well for Huarong’s creditors. Investors fear that any restructuring will prioritise onshore bondholders over those sitting just south of the Chinese border. “Keepwells will either go away or be redefined,” says Alaa Bushehri of bnp Paribas Asset Management. Huge losses stemming from Huarong could even damage Hong Kong’s reputation. “Cross-border investors may not find enough protection in Hong Kong, which may hurt its role as a fixed-income offshore centre for Chinese firms,” Natixis, a French bank, noted in a research report.</p><p>Keepwells may not be a ticket across the border. But a parallel test of the legal firewall between China and Hong Kong is also playing out this year. On May 14th courts on both sides of the border said they could begin to mutually recognise some insolvency cases. The pilot project will help courts in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xiamen acknowledge restructuring or liquidation orders from Hong Kong courts that involve assets in the three mainland cities.</p><p>The scope for the test is narrow. Claimants must prove that the company’s “centre of main interests” is in Hong Kong. This could be tricky; most Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong are incorporated in offshore centres such as the Cayman Islands. Over time, though, as courts on both sides of the border become more familiar with each other, it could “potentially break down the high barrier” between mainland China and Hong Kong, says Look Chan Ho, a barrister in Hong Kong who helped design the pilot. That could take years, warns another lawyer, who sees the pilot as largely symbolic.</p><p>Nevertheless, cross-border recognition for insolvency cases has taken on a new urgency for Chinese courts. It is not just foreign investors who are anxious for recourse. In recent years Chinese groups have fanned out across the globe, hoovering up flashy assets. Many, notably hna, an airlines-to-finance conglomerate, have fallen on hard times. State creditors are eager to recover their losses by making claims on foreign assets, but may need recognition from foreign courts to do so. Reciprocity could help the Communist Party clean up the corporate mess.</p><p>China has not adopted the un’s framework on cross-border insolvency, which is widely used for international restructuring. But its courts are seeking recognition abroad. In 2019 a bankruptcy case under Chinese law received recognition by an American court for only the second time. That ruling stopped other claims on the Chinese firm’s assets in America. In 2020, a Hong Kong court recognised a Chinese insolvency case concerning cefc Shanghai International, part of a failed conglomerate that had gone on a spree in former Soviet republics. Both cases show that traffic between China and the rest of the world is increasingly two-way—leaving troubled executives with nowhere to hide. </p><p><a id="when-does-transitory-inflation-become-sustained"></a></p><h1 id="When-does-transitory-inflation-become-sustained"><a href="#When-does-transitory-inflation-become-sustained" class="headerlink" title="When does transitory inflation become sustained?"></a>When does transitory inflation become sustained?</h1><p>Some lessons from the 1970s</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>At nearly 43 years old, the median American worker has never in her career experienced an annual rate of “core” inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, above 3%. That will soon change. Core consumer prices in America rose by 0.9% month-on-month in April, the highest jump since 1982, practically guaranteeing that the annual rate will exceed 3% in the near future. Some economists sense the first stirrings of an outbreak of sustained high inflation, like that which afflicted many countries in the 1970s. But prevailing theories of inflation suggest that, for now at least, this threat remains remote.</p><p>The Great Inflation, as the episode in the 1970s is often called, led to radical revisions in macroeconomic thinking. Until then Keynesian economists believed that a permanently lower rate of unemployment could be achieved by accepting higher inflation. Critics of this view, like Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, thought differently. In the long run, they argued, the unemployment rate was determined by an economy’s structural features. A government using easy money to push joblessness below this “natural” level would fail. Instead, inflation would accelerate as people learned to expect faster price growth.</p><p>The Great Inflation lent credibility to the critics. But Friedman’s monetarism—the view that inflation in the long run was determined by growth in the money supply—also proved inadequate. Central banks that tried to target money growth found its relationship with inflation to be unstable. They have since been guided by a hybrid “New Keynesian” framework, where inflation is determined by three main factors: the effects of supply shocks; the extent to which the economy is operating above or below capacity; and people’s expectations of inflation. The debates around the probable trajectory of inflation today hinge on these variables.</p><p>Start first with supply shocks. The current inflation spike is clearly rooted in disruptions relating to the messy process of reopening. Supply shocks featured prominently in the Great Inflation as well, which might suggest that a short-term problem can quickly become entrenched. But a closer examination of that episode provides some reassurance. Work by Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Jeremy Rudd of the Federal Reserve suggests that the Great Inflation in fact reflected two distinct phenomena: a persistent problem of too much demand, overlaid by short bursts of supply-side pressures. Shocks to food and energy markets led to dramatic spikes in inflation in the 1970s. But Messrs Blinder and Rudd point out that inflation quickly dropped when these shocks abated. Headline inflation in America rose by nine percentage points from 1972 to 1974, but by 1976 had fallen by seven percentage points. That suggests that supply pressures today should ease when disruptions are resolved.</p><p>An economy that is operating beyond its capacity could perhaps create more enduring inflation problems. Here again history is instructive. Inflation had been creeping up in America well before the 1970s, rising from less than 2% in the early 1960s to nearly 6% later in the decade. That was the result of a policy error: the Fed consistently let demand exceed productive capacity. Why it did so remains the subject of debate. It may have failed to grasp that productivity growth was slowing, thereby overestimating the economy’s potential. Or it may have been reluctant to incur the social or political costs of inducing unemployment to rein in inflation. It took the grim determination of Paul Volcker, who became the Fed’s chairman in 1979, to expunge this inflationary inertia.</p><p>Some economists worry that today’s stimulus-powered growth could lead to a repeat of the errors of the past. Employment in America remains nearly 8m short of its pre-pandemic level, pointing to plenty of spare capacity. But even the Fed reckons that this might quickly be hoovered up, with unemployment falling below its long-run rate by the end of 2022. Yet though the disappearance of slack could add to inflation pressures, it may not do so by very much: shifts in unemployment seem to have had smaller effects on inflation in recent decades. In fact, research by Jonathon Hazell of Princeton University, Juan Herreño of Columbia University and Emi Nakamura and Jon Steinsson of the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that this phenomenon may not be new. They find that the relationship between unemployment and inflation has been fairly weak across American states since at least the late 1970s. The drop in inflation that occurred on Volcker’s watch owed less to high unemployment, they argue, than to a profound shift in the public’s inflation expectations.</p><p>What to expect when you’re not expecting<br>Expectations are the trickiest piece of the inflation equation. Measurement is one problem. A survey by the University of Michigan suggests that consumers expect average annual inflation of 3.1% over the next five years; market-based measures imply a rate of about 2.6% over the same period, before falling to about 2.2% over the subsequent five years. That is above the Fed’s 2% target but still well short of a 1970s-style rerun. Perhaps punters are less worried about price pressures. Or perhaps they trust in the Fed’s commitment to price stability. Mr Hazell and his co-authors posit that inflation expectations dropped dramatically in the early 1980s because the public perceived a “regime shift” at the Fed. A repeat of the Great Inflation, then, might require another big change to central banks’ frameworks, and time for the public to perceive it.</p><p>Is such an about-face imminent? The Fed recently amended its approach, and says it will accept periods of above-target inflation to offset past undershooting. Whether this represents a “regime shift” is another question. The Fed still promises inflation of just 2% on average. It has not dropped its commitment to keep control over prices, nor does the public believe it has. Middle-aged Americans may get a taste of modestly high inflation this year. But they are hardly returning to the economy of their parents. </p><p><a id="science--technology---improving-ventilation-will-help-curb-sars-cov-2"></a></p><h1 id="Science-amp-technology-—Improving-ventilation-will-help-curb-SARS-CoV-2"><a href="#Science-amp-technology-—Improving-ventilation-will-help-curb-SARS-CoV-2" class="headerlink" title="(Science &amp; technology)—Improving ventilation will help curb SARS-CoV-2"></a>(Science &amp; technology)—Improving ventilation will help curb SARS-CoV-2</h1><p>There has been a misunderstanding about how the virus spreads</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On january 24th 2020 three families, together numbering 21 people, came independently to eat lunch at a restaurant in Guangzhou. It was the eve of the Chinese New Year. Extra seating had been squeezed in to accommodate more patrons than usual, and these families were crowded onto neighbouring tables along one wall of the windowless room (see plan). The largest of them—a party of ten who had arrived the day before from Wuhan—sat around the middle table. Later that day, one of their number developed fever and a cough and, at a hospital, was diagnosed with covid-19. Within two weeks, ten of the 21 were confirmed as being infected with sars-cov-2.</p><p>The families involved had never met and video footage showed they had no close contact during the lunch. An initial analysis by the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention proposed that the infection had spread via respiratory “droplets”. But medical lore has it that such droplets—defined as particles expelled while breathing that are more than five microns across—cannot travel more than a couple of metres after they have been exhaled. And some of those who became infected during the lunch were farther than that from the “index” patient.</p><p>It made no sense. How could a single infected person transmit the virus to nine others in just an hour when there had been no direct contact between them?</p><p>Current thinking<br>The outbreak at the Guangzhou restaurant was the first recorded “superspreading” event of the pandemic. Superspreading is loosely defined as being when a single person infects many others in a short space of time. More than 2,000 cases of it have now been recorded—in places as varied as slaughterhouses, megachurches, fitness centres and nightclubs—and many scientists argue that it is the main means by which covid-19 is transmitted.</p><p>In cracking the puzzle of superspreading, researchers have had to re-evaluate their understanding of sars-cov-2’s transmission. Most documented superspreadings have happened indoors and involved large groups gathered in poorly ventilated spaces. That points to sars-cov-2 being a virus which travels easily through the air, in contradistinction to the early belief that short-range encounters and infected surfaces were the main risks. This, in turn, suggests that paying attention to the need for good ventilation will be important in managing the next phase of the pandemic, as people return to mixing with each other inside homes, offices, gyms, restaurants and other enclosed spaces.</p><p>It has taken a long time for public-health experts to acknowledge that covid-19 routinely spreads through the air in this way. Social distancing and mask-wearing were recommended with the intention of cutting direct, close-range transmission by virus-carrying droplets of mucus or saliva breathed out by infected individuals. The main risk of spreading the illness indirectly was thought to come not from these droplets being carried long distances by air currents, but rather by their landing on nearby surfaces, on which viruses they were harbouring might survive for hours, or even days. Anyone who touched such an infected surface could then transfer those viruses, via their fingers, to their mouth, eyes or nose. This makes sense if sars-cov-2 spreads in the same way as influenza—which was indeed the hypothesis in March 2020, when the World Health Organisation ( who) declared the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Hence the advice to disinfect surfaces and wash hands frequently.</p><p>Doctors did know at the time that not all respiratory particles fall fast. Those smaller than five microns can become aerosols, staying aloft for hours and potentially travelling much farther than droplets, or simply accumulating in the air within a closed room. Anyone inhaling these aerosols could then become infected. But this was assumed not to matter, because aerosols were thought to be relevant only in specialist medical settings, such as when patients are attached to a ventilator in an intensive-care unit. Intubation, as this process is known, does indeed create aerosols, as the breathing tube is forced down a patient’s trachea. But a wider risk was not perceived. The who therefore played down the risks of aerosols, issuing guidance via its Twitter and Facebook pages at the end of March 2020 that the general public need not worry. “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” it said, adding that any claims to the contrary were “misinformation”.</p><p>Physics envy<br>Researchers outside the medical world, however—especially those who study the physics of particles in the air—felt the evidence pointed in a different direction. The Guangzhou restaurant outbreak was an early warning. Around the same time, 1,300km across the country in Ningbo, 23 of 68 passengers on a bus fitted with an air-recycling system had been infected during a one-and-a-half-hour journey. But the worst known case of superspreading early in the pandemic was American. This happened at a choir practice in Skagit Valley, Washington State, in March 2020. Of the 61 people present during a two-and-a-half-hour meeting, 53 became infected. In all these cases, investigation showed that those infected were not necessarily the people closest to the index patients, as might be expected if transmission had been by droplet or surface contact.</p><p>None of this surprised Lidia Morawska, a physicist at the Queensland University of Technology, in Brisbane, Australia. She had spent much of her career studying how pollution caused by so-called particulate matter, such as dust and smog, affects air quality. After the original sars outbreak, which happened in 2003, she began experiments to show how respiratory particles are generated in people’s throats and then transported through the air.</p><p>She demonstrated that received medical wisdom is wrong. Because exhaled breath is a moist, hot, turbulent cloud of air, a five-micron-wide droplet released at a height of one and a half metres (about the distance above ground of the average mouth or nose) can easily be carried dozens of metres before settling. Also, the generation of respiratory particles is not restricted to medical settings. Liquid drops of all sizes—including those defined as aerosols—are continuously shed while people are breathing, talking, sneezing or singing (see chart).</p><p>In July 2020 Dr Morawska wanted to bring this work to the attention of public-health agencies. She assembled a group of 36 experts on aerosols and air quality to write an open letter outlining their evidence for infection by smaller liquid drops and calling on the who to change its tune on airborne transmission. “We appeal to the medical community and to the relevant national and international bodies to recognise the potential for airborne spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19),” they wrote in Clinical Infectious Diseases. “There is significant potential for inhalation exposure to viruses in microscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets) at short to medium distances (up to several metres, or room scale), and we are advocating for the use of preventive measures to mitigate this route of airborne transmission.” More than 200 other researchers from 32 countries also signed the letter.</p><p>One signatory was Jose-Luis Jimenez, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He says that the confusion in health circles over whether or not airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 is important can be traced back to medical textbooks that still contain outdated descriptions of how respiratory particles are produced and move.</p><p>But the widespread assertion, still stubbornly promulgated by the who, that droplets above five microns in diameter do not stay airborne, but rather settle close to their source, is a dodgy foundation on which to build public-health advice. According to Dr Jimenez, physicists have shown that any particle less than 100 microns across can become airborne in the right circumstances. All of this matters because hand-washing and social distancing, though they remain important, are not enough to stop an airborne virus spreading, especially indoors. Masks will help, by slowing down and partially filtering an infectious person’s exhalations. But to keep offices, schools, hospitals, care homes and so on safe also requires improvements in their ventilation.</p><p>Fan-tastic<br>Under pressure from physicists, the who recently acknowledged that better ventilation should be used to help prevent covid-19’s spread—and in March it published a “roadmap” to that effect. But the document fell far short of properly recognising the hazard of airborne transmission and, therefore, the need to control it. Despite overwhelming evidence that it happens, the agency still maintained that sars-cov-2 “mainly spreads between people when an infected person is in close contact with another person”.</p><p>Others, though, are acting on the new knowledge. Martin Bazant, a chemical engineer, and John Bush, a mathematician, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have devised a way to calculate how long it would be safe to stay within a room that contains an infected person. The pair described their model in a paper in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Applied to a typical American school class of 19 pupils and a teacher, the safe time after an infected individual enters a classroom that is naturally ventilated (that is, how long before the risk of infection is unacceptably high) is 72 minutes. This period can, though, be extended in two ways. One is by mechanical ventilation of the room, which increases the safe time to 7.2 hours. The other is by everyone wearing masks. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, mask-wearing increases the safe time to eight hours. But the real benefit comes from combining these approaches. That pushes the safe time up to 80 hours—almost 14 days if a school day is six hours long. Add in intervening weekends and a class wearing masks in a school room with adequate ventilation would thereby be safe for longer than the time it takes to recover from covid-19, which is typically between one and two weeks. School transmissions would thus be rare.</p><p>A caveat is that the modelling assumed a classroom with minimal talking, physical activity or singing by the pupils. But games lessons would usually be outdoors and singing lessons could be. As to too much talking, teachers might welcome an unimpeachable reason to tell pupils to keep quiet in class.</p><p>Infection risk will not always be distributed evenly around a room. Jiarong Hong, a mechanical engineer at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, therefore used computer models to study how aerosols would spread in a classroom, according to the location of an infected individual and the position of nearby fans or air filters. Assuming the teacher was infected, and so was releasing virus-laden aerosols at the front of the class, Dr Hong’s modelling shows that placing an air cleaner or extractor fan at the front of the room sets up an airflow which prevents the movement of such aerosols towards the pupils. An even better aerosol-cleansing effect is achieved when the fans and filters are elevated above the people in the room. This takes advantage of the rising air plumes created by body heat, which mean that exhaled aerosols tend to float upwards. Dr Hong’s modelling shows that even small, cheap box fans mounted in this way would do a good job of keeping classrooms safe and preventing aerosols from building up to dangerous levels.</p><p>Dr Hong has also modelled the air flow in the Guangzhou restaurant outbreak of January 2020. As the plan shows, he found that the movements of virus-laden aerosols around the three affected families of diners matched the seating positions of the people who eventually became sick. The outbreak occurred because there was no source of external fresh air and a nearby recirculating air conditioner redistributed aerosols from the infected person to the other tables, creating a contaminated bubble of air that was increasingly burdened with viruses over the course of the lunch.</p><p>The risk, then, is real. But how can the occupants of a room know whether it is well-ventilated? Just because a room feels spacious and an air conditioner is operating does not mean the air inside it is clean.</p><p>Here, Dr Morawska has a suggestion. In a (non-scientific) experiment last year, she took a carbon-dioxide meter into a large, high-ceilinged, air-conditioned restaurant near her home. CO2 concentrations can be a useful proxy for clean air. Outdoor air contains around 400 parts per million (ppm) of the gas, and people’s exhaled breath contains around 40,000ppm. Exhaling into a room therefore gradually raises its CO2 concentration unless the ventilation is good enough to remove the excess.</p><p>According to experts on air quality, anything below 500ppm in a room means the ventilation is good. At 800ppm, 1% of the air someone is breathing has already been exhaled recently by someone else. At 4,400ppm, this rises to 10%, and would be classed as dangerous. These sorts of levels are seen only in crowded spaces with poor airflow. To keep the risk of covid-19 low, CO2 levels should be well below 700ppm.</p><p>When Dr Morawska conducted her experiment, the restaurant had ten people in it—far fewer than would normally be allowed—and the CO2 concentration was already 1,000ppm when she arrived. Within an hour it had jumped to 2,000ppm. “We continued sitting during the dinner for another hour or so,” she says. “So if there was someone infected there, well this could have been a problem.”</p><p>Though anecdotal, that tale indicates a serious risk—and one which resonates beyond covid-19. All sorts of symptoms, from headaches, fatigue and shortness of breath to skin-irritation, dizziness and nausea, are linked to poor ventilation. It has also been connected with more absences from work and lower productivity.</p><p>The ventilation measures needed to deal with all this are not difficult, but existing regulations and design standards often have different objectives—particularly, these days, conserving heat and thus reducing energy consumption. That often means recirculating air, rather than exchanging it with fresh air from the outside world. (An exception is passenger aircraft, which refresh cabin air frequently.)</p><p>In situations where it is not possible to reduce health risks by ventilation alone—for example, places like nightclubs, where there are lots of people crowded together, or gyms, where they are breathing heavily—air filtration could easily be incorporated into ventilation systems. Air could also be disinfected, using germicidal ultraviolet lamps placed within air-conditioning systems or near ceilings in rooms.</p><p>All change<br>And then there is public awareness. “Before this pandemic it was completely socially acceptable to come to the office coughing, sneezing, spreading viruses around,” says Dr Morawska. “No one would say anything—even people educated to understand how infections are transmitted.”</p><p>That insouciance must be corrected, she says. The who must acknowledge the need to control airborne pathogens and governments must agree and enforce comprehensive standards for indoor air quality that keeps people healthy. One way to ensure compliance might be to issue ventilation certificates for buildings, similar to the food-hygiene certificates which already exist for restaurants. Occupants should also be given information about air quality routinely, she adds, through the use of monitors and sensors that can display a room’s carbon-dioxide levels or other relevant measures.</p><p>For new buildings this should not cost much extra, though replacing exiting ventilation systems might be costly. But not as costly as covid-19 has been. And if improvements in indoor air quality also reduced absenteeism and improved productivity, those gains might cover that cost. “Although detailed economic analyses remain to be done,” wrote Dr Morawska in a recent edition of Science, “the existing evidence suggests that controlling airborne infections can cost society less than it would to bear them.” </p><p><a id="genetic-engineering-may-help-control-disease-carrying-mosquitoes"></a></p><h1 id="Genetic-engineering-may-help-control-disease-carrying-mosquitoes"><a href="#Genetic-engineering-may-help-control-disease-carrying-mosquitoes" class="headerlink" title="Genetic engineering may help control disease-carrying mosquitoes"></a>Genetic engineering may help control disease-carrying mosquitoes</h1><p>It produces fit and healthy eunuchs</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Every year, hundreds of millions of people catch mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. Hundreds of thousands die. Drug treatments are imperfect. And, despite decades of effort, vaccines have, for many of these diseases, proved tricky to develop.</p><p>Better, then, to stop those infections happening in the first place, by exterminating—or at least suppressing—the mosquitoes that carry the diseases. In a paper just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers led by Craig Montell, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, describe how crispr-cas9, a new and powerful genetic-engineering process, could help to do just that.</p><p>Dr Montell and his colleagues used crispr to boost an existing control method called the sterile insect technique (sit). This involves releasing lots of sterilised males into the wild. Females that mate with these males produce no offspring. Repeated releases can reduce populations dramatically. sit has been used in North America to eliminate screwworm flies, an agricultural pest, and to suppress several species of crop-munching fruit flies.</p><p>It has been tried on mosquitoes, too, but with less success. One reason seems to be side-effects of the procedure. To sterilise them, males are zapped with radiation or exposed to toxic chemicals. This works, but it damages them in other ways, too. The result can be sickly individuals that struggle to compete in the mating game with their wild counterparts.</p><p>Dr Montell and his colleagues hoped that crispr might offer an alternative. Their first step was to look for genes which, when disabled, would render male mosquitoes infertile. They began their hunt in fruit flies, a stalwart of genetic research. They focused on a gene that, when removed, made male fruit flies sterile—and which was present in a similar form in their target mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, which is the vector of, among other illnesses, yellow fever, dengue and Zika virus. Disabling the equivalent gene in male Aedes likewise left them infertile.</p><p>Crucially, the genetic tweak involved did not appear to hinder the modified mosquitoes in any other way. On every measure of healthiness they performed as well as their wild counterparts. And even though they were firing blanks, they were still able to mate with females in the laboratory.</p><p>Although the details are not fully understood, says Dr Montell, once female mosquitoes have mated a few times, they become less receptive to doing so again. Mating with an infertile male is therefore not only fruitless in itself, but should also leave a female less interested in unmodified males in future. Sure enough, a series of experiments conducted in cages suggested that releasing between five and six genetically modified males for each wild male was enough to cut the number of reproducing females by half. Upping that ratio to 15:1 dropped it by 80%.</p><p>There is more work to do before field trials, says Dr Montell. But having established the principle, he is excited to see where the work might lead. That the target gene is found in both fruit flies and Aedes suggests it is likely to exist in other disease-carrying mosquitoes, too. And that the engineered males leave no offspring means fewer worries about any unintended consequences which might arise from releasing millions of genetically modified organisms into the environment.</p><p>More speculatively, the team is pondering whether it might be possible to create males which can outplay their un-engineered cousins at the mating game, despite being infertile. Improving on millions of years of evolution would usually be hard. Even if researchers could find an alteration that improved a male’s attractiveness, it would probably reduce the animal’s overall fitness. Such a genetic tweak would ordinarily be winnowed out by natural selection over subsequent generations. But because each generation of males is created anew in a laboratory, says Dr Montell, there is no long run to worry about. If the team can find the right mutation, such genetically engineered hommes fatales could give mosquito-suppression efforts an even bigger boost.</p><p><a id="the-fog-of-war-may-confound-weapons-that-think-for-themselves"></a></p><h1 id="The-fog-of-war-may-confound-weapons-that-think-for-themselves"><a href="#The-fog-of-war-may-confound-weapons-that-think-for-themselves" class="headerlink" title="The fog of war may confound weapons that think for themselves"></a>The fog of war may confound weapons that think for themselves</h1><p>Some states want a ban. But would it be respected?</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The skies of Israel have lit up in recent weeks with the sinuous trails of interceptors colliding with thick volleys of rockets fired from Gaza. These spectacular aerial duels show autonomous weapons at work. For, though each launcher of Iron Dome, Israel’s missile-defence system, is manned by soldiers, only a computer can keep up with the most intense barrages. “Sometimes in large salvos, you can’t have men in the loop for every rocket,” says one Israeli soldier. It is largely an algorithm that decides where and when to fire.</p><p>Iron Dome is a defensive system that attacks physical objects (the incoming rockets) in an aerial battle-theatre devoid of immediate civilian bystanders, albeit that falling debris could injure or kill someone. But one day similar latitude might be given to offensive weapons which fire at human enemies on the ground, in more crowded places. A new report by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (unidir), a think-tank, explains why that will be far harder than knocking rockets out of the sky.</p><p>Autonomous systems rely on artificial intelligence (ai), which in turn relies on data collected from those systems’ surroundings. When these data are good—plentiful, reliable and similar to the data on which the system’s algorithm was trained—ai can excel. But in many circumstances data are incomplete, ambiguous or overwhelming. Consider the difference between radiology, in which algorithms outperform human beings in analysing x-ray images, and self-driving cars, which still struggle to make sense of a cacophonous stream of disparate inputs from the outside world. On the battlefield, that problem is multiplied.</p><p>“Conflict environments are harsh, dynamic and adversarial,” says unidir. Dust, smoke and vibration can obscure or damage the cameras, radars and other sensors that capture data in the first place. Even a speck of dust on a sensor might, in a particular light, mislead an algorithm into classifying a civilian object as a military one, says Arthur Holland Michel, the report’s author. Moreover, enemies constantly attempt to fool those sensors through camouflage, concealment and trickery. Pedestrians have no reason to bamboozle self-driving cars, whereas soldiers work hard to blend into foliage. And a mixture of civilian and military objects—evident on the ground in Gaza in recent weeks—could produce a flood of confusing data.</p><p>The biggest problem is that algorithms trained on limited data samples would encounter a much wider range of inputs in a war zone. In the same way that recognition software trained largely on white faces struggles to recognise black ones, an autonomous weapon fed with examples of Russian military uniforms will be less reliable against Chinese ones. “ai systems tend to be very brittle against anything that wasn’t covered in their development or testing,” says Mr Holland Michel. An autonomous system effective against one country might be unusable against a foe with superior camouflage, for instance.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the technology is already trickling onto the battlefield. In its war with Armenia last year, Azerbaijan unleashed Israeli-made loitering munitions theoretically capable of choosing their own targets. Ziyan, a Chinese company, boasts that its Blowfish a3, a gun-toting helicopter drone, “autonomously performs…complex combat missions” including “targeted precision strikes”. The International Committee of the Red Cross (icrc) says that many of today’s remote-controlled weapons could be turned into autonomous ones with little more than a software upgrade or a change of doctrine.</p><p>The limits of autonomy<br>On May 12th the icrc published a new and nuanced position on the matter, recommending new rules to regulate autonomous weapons, including a prohibition on those that are “unpredictable”, and also a blanket ban on any such weapon that has human beings as its targets. These things will be debated in December at the five-yearly review conference of the un Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, originally established in 1980 to ban landmines and other “inhumane” arms. Government experts will meet thrice over the summer and autumn, under un auspices, to lay the groundwork. “There is momentum now towards a decision,” says Neil Davison, a scientific and policy adviser at the icrc. Even among states who oppose new rules, he says, there is greater discussion of the limits that might need to be placed on autonomous weapons.</p><p>Yet powerful states remain wary of ceding an advantage to rivals. In March a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence established by America’s Congress predicted that autonomous weapons would eventually be “capable of levels of performance, speed and discrimination that exceed human capabilities”. A worldwide prohibition on their development and use would be “neither feasible nor currently in the interests of the United States,” it concluded—in part, it argued, because Russia and China would probably cheat.</p><p><a id="a-better-fog-trap"></a></p><h1 id="A-better-fog-trap"><a href="#A-better-fog-trap" class="headerlink" title="A better fog-trap"></a>A better fog-trap</h1><p>A clever upgrade of a humble but useful technology</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Every night, air cooled and moistened by the Humboldt current blows over Chile’s northern coast and across the Atacama desert. The billowing banks of fog thus created might look insubstantial, but there is water here to be captured—and in this, the driest place on Earth, capture it people do. Fog-harvesting will never be big business, for it needs particular conditions to operate well. But in zones like the Atacama, where moisture-laden breezes bring fog but no rain, the invention in the 1960s of traps which can pluck that moisture from the air has helped sustain settlements otherwise on the brink of drought.</p><p>Fog traps are polymer-mesh screens mounted in metal frames (see picture). As misty zephyrs blow through them, droplets of water adhere to the mesh. These absorb others until the result breaks free and runs down the screen, as a raindrop runs down a window pane, into a collector. A typical trap, with a 40-square-metre collecting area, yields about 200 litres a day. That is enough to supply around 60 people with drinking water. Such a collector costs $1,000 or so, and will last a decade.</p><p>A simple idea, then. But even simple technology can be upgraded. And that is exactly what Urszula Stachewicz of the agh University of Science and Technology, in Krakow, Poland, proposes to do.</p><p>Her upgrade relies on giving the mesh a slight electrical charge. Overall, the molecules in it are electrically neutral. But polymer molecules are large, and their electrons can move about within them. Uneven distribution of these electrons means some parts of a molecule are positive and some negative. That fact might be exploited to give the outside of each thread in a mesh one electrical polarity (either positive or negative) while burying the other polarity in the thread’s interior. Just as static electricity will attract a balloon to a wall, a surface charge created in this way will attract water droplets from the air.</p><p>Previous attempts to do this have coated the threads with metal. But that is expensive. As they describe in acs Nano, Dr Stachewicz and her student Daniel Ura have done it by changing the way the threads are spun, which is cheap.</p><p>At the moment, those threads are created by a process called melt-spinning. This involves melting the polymer and pushing the resulting liquid through a hollow needle, out of a hole in the needle’s tip and onto a spinning drum, where it cools and solidifies. Dr Stachewicz and Mr Ura propose instead to use a technique called electrospinning. This also involves a hollow needle. But instead of being melted, the polymer is dissolved in a solvent, and instead of being propelled from the needle’s tip by pressure from behind, it is attracted to the drum by the creation of an electrical potential difference between the drum and the needle. As the stream of dissolved polymer travels through the air, the solvent evaporates, leaving behind a solid thread.</p><p>One consequence of electrospinning is that the voltage attracting the thread from needle to drum also attracts or repels, according to their polarity, the charges on the molecules within. This reorients those molecules, aligning them (and thus their charges) in a way that does not happen in a melt-spun thread. That can create the sort of polarity difference between the interior and the exterior of a thread the two researchers were looking for.</p><p>Dr Stachewicz and Mr Ura experimented with different potential differences between needle and drum and eventually found one that resulted in meshes able to collect 50% more water than commercial versions, at no extra cost of production. At the moment these are just prototypes, but they expect soon to have a practical version which can be made available for sale. And that will certainly improve the lives of people who rely for their survival on drawing water not from a well, but from thin air. </p><p><a id="books--arts---exploring-a-russian-family%E2%80%99s-past%E2%80%94and-the-meaning-of-history"></a></p><h1 id="Books-amp-arts-—Exploring-a-Russian-family’s-past—and-the-meaning-of-history"><a href="#Books-amp-arts-—Exploring-a-Russian-family’s-past—and-the-meaning-of-history" class="headerlink" title="(Books &amp; arts)—Exploring a Russian family’s past—and the meaning of history"></a>(Books &amp; arts)—Exploring a Russian family’s past—and the meaning of history</h1><p>For Maria Stepanova, writing “is always a rescue operation”</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In Memory of Memory. By Maria Stepanova. Translated by Sasha Dugdale. New Directions; 400 pages; $19.95. Fitzcarraldo Editions; £14.99</p><p>As a child, Maria Stepanova adored a game called sekretiki, or “little secrets”. She would dig holes in the ground, line them with foil, fill them with special objects, cover them with glass and bury them in the dirt, to be found by friends in the know. As she grew up to become one of Russia’s most celebrated contemporary poets, writing came to play a similar role in her life. “I begin to love someone or something, information accumulates of its own accord, and I want to write about it, to put that material into a storehouse, to find its unexpected rhythms,” she explains from Moscow. “I want to make a sekretik.”</p><p>Ms Stepanova’s deepest love is for the past, in particular her own family’s, and her luminous book “In Memory of Memory” is a sekretik devoted to them. After inheriting an archive of her ancestors’ photographs, letters and ephemera, she set out to make sense of the family’s history, traipsing from Paris to Saratov on the Volga and roaming across art, literature and philosophy. Eschewing the traditional quest narrative, she blends memoir, criticism, essay, documentary and travelogue. The book won several literary awards in Russia; on reading it, thinks Yury Saprykin, the founder of Polka, a Russian literary website, “You immediately feel that you are encountering a great work of art.” In Sasha Dugdale’s supple English translation, it is a contender for this year’s International Booker Prize, to be awarded on June 2nd.</p><p>The story of the author’s Russian-Jewish family is not the stuff of headlines. “Everyone else’s ancestors had taken part in history, but mine seemed to have been mere lodgers in history’s house,” Ms Stepanova writes, confessing “embarrassment” at how seemingly banal their lives were. Her relatives had bit parts in the grand narratives of the 20th century, skirting its catastrophes. And the archive raises as many questions as it answers; her attempts to fill in the lacunae leave her with only “the tongue-twister of my aunts’ names Sanya, Sonya, Soka, a lot of photographs of the nameless and the noteless, some ethereal and unattached anecdotes and the familiar faces of unfamiliar people”.</p><p>In other hands, such material might fall flat. Ms Stepanova’s learning and lyricism bring it to life. She hears stories about her great-grandmother Sarra that have “the laurel-leaf taste of legend”. She sees hills “the colour of dark copper, rising and falling as evenly as breath”, and blackened villages where new churches gleam “white as new crowns on old teeth”.</p><p>Little escapes her meditative gaze. “I wanted to create a book with many entryways and exits,” Ms Stepanova says. She muses on everything from vintage clothing to the selfie, from the French philosopher Jacques Rancière to the American artist Joseph Cornell to the Russian poet Grigory Dashevsky. In a particularly thought-provoking chapter, she brings the Russian writers Osip Mandelstam and Marina Tsvetaeva into conversation with the German author W.G. Sebald. She tests out metaphors for memory and methods for enlivening archival material, weaving excerpts of relatives’ letters throughout the book. Some readers may choke on this allusive style, as if drinking from a dusty old glass. Many will find it intoxicating.</p><p>Speak, memory<br>The myriad references to other thinkers serve a purpose: to weave Russia back into the wider Western cultural fabric. As Ms Stepanova sees it, in the 19th and early 20th centuries Russian culture was part of a shared dialogue and exchange of ideas. Her search for traces of her great-grandmother leads her to Paris, where Sarra studied medicine in the 1910s—as Franz Kafka and Amedeo Modigliani were roaming the same city’s streets.</p><p>But from the late 1930s an “invisible curtain” divided Russian culture from the West, Ms Stepanova says, and the country became an “exporter of a kind of borderline experience”. Its literature, from Alexander Solzhenitsyn to Varlam Shalamov, came to be seen primarily as “confessional or reportorial material”. By linking writers from across that curtain, she aims to refute the idea that the Russian experience is separate and unique. A passage in which she visits a museum in New York evokes this sense of connection. Coming upon an image of autumn woods, “I begin to cry, very quietly, under my breath, because it’s the very same Moscow wood where I used to walk with my parents once, many thousands of miles ago, and we are now looking at each other again.” As Mr Saprykin puts it, the book “returns us to the sensation of Russia being a part of world culture”.</p><p>Struggles over memory, Ms Stepanova notes, are not exclusive to Russia. In essays elsewhere, she reflected on the appeals to past greatness that, in 2014, fuelled Russia’s war with Ukraine; her observations could just as well apply to the rhetoric of Trump-era America and Brexit Britain. “The virus has somehow spread around the world,” she laments. (Her output is formid able. She is editor-in-chief of Colta.ru, an online cultural journal; a collection of her essays and verse has been published this year as “The Voice Over”; another book of poetry is out in English as “War of the Beasts and the Animals”.)</p><p>When the past is prosecuted in this way, suggests Ms Stepanova, it becomes an opportunity “for settling scores, for a kind of conversation about the present that for some reason cannot happen in real time”. This seepage across time is the underlying theme of “In Memory of Memory”, says Stanislav Lvovsky, a Russian poet and critic: “It’s not a story about history, but about how the past lives on in the present.”</p><p>These disparate battles over memory may be part of the same war, but in Russia they tend to rage at a higher pitch. Her country, Ms Stepanova says, has long had competing channels for memory: an official, state-endorsed narrative, and family stories, which “like lace, have more holes than threads”. Vladimir Putin has made a glorious version of the past, in particular victory in the second world war, a pillar of his statist ideology. Last week, in a meeting with senior officials, Mr Putin declared that “all kinds of Russophobic individuals and unscrupulous politicians are trying to attack Russian history”. He promised “to ensure the continuity of historical memory in Russian society, so that decades and centuries from now, future generations will cherish the truth about the war”.</p><p>Ms Stepanova makes the dissonance between these ways of thinking clear in a poignant chapter about the siege of Leningrad. A distant relative of hers perished in battle there, writing quaint letters home until his death. She quotes Lydia Ginzburg, a critic who noted from behind the Nazi blockade how the Soviet system “dehumanised the individual to such an extent that he had learnt to sacrifice himself without even realising it”.</p><p>By contrast, Ms Stepanova imbues individual lives with meaning independent of the collective fate. For her, writing “is always a rescue operation”. Her family’s relics are safely preserved in their sekretik. </p><p><a id="a-biting-satire-of-race-and-capitalism-in-america"></a></p><h1 id="A-biting-satire-of-race-and-capitalism-in-America"><a href="#A-biting-satire-of-race-and-capitalism-in-America" class="headerlink" title="A biting satire of race and capitalism in America"></a>A biting satire of race and capitalism in America</h1><p>“Once you learn how to sell,” says the narrator of “Black Buck”, “anything is possible”</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Black Buck. By Mateo Askaripour. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 400 pages; $26. John Murray; £14.99</p><p>True to his name, Darren Vender is a salesman. In the opening pages of “Black Buck”, Mateo Askaripour’s sprightly yet savage debut novel, Darren is doling out Grasshopper Frappuccinos at a Starbucks in Manhattan. After four years he has earned the black apron of a coffee master; but as former valedictorian of his class at a prestigious high school in the Bronx, he knows that a job pulling shots doesn’t amount to much. Then he upsells a new drink to Rhett, a regular customer—and is invited to work at Rhett’s company. “Once you learn how to sell, to truly sell, anything is possible,” Darren says. But is it?</p><p>Mr Askaripour’s satire of the tech industry—and of the intersection between capitalism and American racial politics—will appeal to fans of Paul Beatty’s Booker-prizewinning novel “The Sellout” and Jordan Peele’s film “Get Out”. When Darren joins Sumwun—a startup hawking online therapy to big companies that want to be seen as caring employers—he is immediately renamed Buck. “If he does his job, he’ll make us each a million bucks,” explains Rhett’s colleague Clyde, winkingly.</p><p>But Darren is the only black person in the team, and the nickname also suggests adehumanising racial stereotype. Colleagues tell him that he resembles Sidney Poitier or Martin Luther King or Malcolm X. Mr Askaripour’s white characters are terrifyingly comfortable in their privilege. “I knew you looked familiar,” says Clyde, “but I wasn’t sure if it was in the way most black people look alike. Not in a racist way, of course.”</p><p>Every day Darren—who comes to call and think of himself as Buck—rides the subway in from Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. Perhaps the novel maps the psychic distance between the narrator’s old and new lives too bluntly, but that is the nature of raw satire such as this. In their earnestness, the self-improvement aphorisms that salt the text in bold type help to humanise Darren’s striving: “Reader: No matter how much it hurts, never let short-term frustration disrupt long-term gain.” The denouement is unexpectedly shocking.</p><p>It would be wishful thinking to find Mr Askaripour’s take on the world totally incredible. “I know.

By Chad Bryant. Harvard University Press; 352 pages; $29.95 and £23.95</p><p>She was in many ways a quintessential local. She had Czech friends, read Czech books and ate that Bohemian staple, potatoes. But Duong Nguyen Jiraskova, a student who in 2008 began blogging about life in Prague, was also untypical. Brought up in the Czech Republic by Vietnamese parents, she straddled two worlds. She celebrated Christmas—and Tet. She used cutlery, but taught friends to handle chopsticks. “Whenever someone asks me where I feel at home,” she wrote, “I never give a one-word answer.”</p><p>One-word answers do not feature in this subtle, lyrical book. Like the denizens of many other cities, Praguers have juggled identities for centuries, even if they have only recently chronicled their efforts online. Chad Bryant concentrates on five fascinating individuals, guiding readers through Czech history along the way.</p><p>He begins in the mid-19th century, when Prague was a Habsburg city and German dominated high culture. That was intolerable for Slav patriots such as Karel Zap, who saw Prague as a kind of Czech Rome; Zap advocated the use of the Czech language and highlighted the glories of Czech culture. He thought only those with a “heightened sense of religiosity and national feeling” should enter St Vitus Cathedral, final resting place of Bohemian kings.</p><p>Yet for all his zeal, Zap sometimes wrote in German—and once went by the Teutonic-sounding Karl Zapp. Mr Bryant threads such ironies through his book, describing people on the fringes of Prague society who stumbled towards belonging. In the interwar years, when the city was becoming thoroughly Czech, Egon Kisch, a German-speaking Jewish journalist, explored soup kitchens and dive bars that recalled the cosmopolitan mood of earlier decades. Hana Frejkova found peace as an actor in Czechoslovakia’s theatres after her father was condemned in a Stalinist show trial.</p><p>Vignettes evoke the city’s changing fortunes. In Kisch’s day Prague had official dogcatchers, one of them boasting an 18th-century proclamation from Empress Maria Theresa confirming his family’s hereditary profession. By the 1970s Prague was a striving socialist city, complete with tower blocks and a new metro system. When the first line opened, officials hired women workers to help Praguers navigate an unfamiliar technology—escalators.</p><p>As Mr Bryant makes clear, Prague has for centuries been a city in flux, each new ruler chiselling his politics into its institutions and infrastructure. That could make it hard for residents, marginalised or otherwise, to keep up. In his most moving chapter, Mr Bryant recounts the life of Vojtech Berger, a carpenter and communist. His views were mistrusted between the wars; but after Czechoslovakia became a communist state in 1948, Berger seems to have been lost: “One wonders if, as a young man, this is what Berger had had in mind.”</p><p>By the end of the book, readers might conclude that standing outside or against the mainstream—as a Czech nationalist or radical carpenter or Vietnamese immigrant—is what lends characters like these their strength. An upbringing that spans two communities is many things, Ms Nguyen Jiraskova has noted, but never boring. As Mr Bryant observes, cities the world over help people like his subjects find and make homes in their own image. </p><p><a id="%E2%80%9Cdangerous-ideas%E2%80%9D-is-an-engrossing-history-of-censorship"></a></p><h1 id="“Dangerous-Ideas”-is-an-engrossing-history-of-censorship"><a href="#“Dangerous-Ideas”-is-an-engrossing-history-of-censorship" class="headerlink" title="“Dangerous Ideas” is an engrossing history of censorship"></a>“Dangerous Ideas” is an engrossing history of censorship</h1><p>The quarrel over free speech will never be resolved, says Eric Berkowitz</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Dangerous Ideas. By Eric Berkowitz. Beacon Press; 320 pages; $29.95. The Westbourne Press; £20</p><p>This lively and wide-ranging history of censorship opens with a wise reminder. “The compulsion to silence others”, writes Eric Berkowitz, an American lawyer and author, “is as old as the urge to speak.” As a firm believer in free speech, Mr Berkowitz views censorship through the ages as mostly futile, perverse or wrong. Yet he grasps that neither side in this ancient contest is pure or simple. Nor, in his engrossing account, do either free speech or its opponents ever win final victories.</p><p>Mr Berkowitz focuses chiefly on the United States and Britain, with glances at other European countries—such as 17th- and 18th-century France, famous for libelles, scurrilous and usually sexual attacks on royalty, clergy and other notables. He briefly widens the field at the end for a discouraging look at enemies of free speech in less liberal or less democratic places.</p><p>Silencers of speech operate directly and indirectly. The most obvious direct kind is state censorship. It may forbid speech unless cleared in advance (pre-censorship), punish it after the event (criminal libel) or burden publishers and media with undue regulations or taxes. Speech here includes not just voicing or disseminating words but proclaiming your faith as you wish, campaigning for your chosen causes and making art without interference.</p><p>Pre-censorship has often proved self-defeating. With the coming of print, books as a rule needed licence before publication. In Britain, where licensing was outsourced to the printers’ guild, prior control proved ineffective and corrupt, and was abandoned by the end of the 17th century. The papal Index of Forbidden Books (1559-1966), backed by the law in many Catholic countries, gave publicity to works that would otherwise have remained obscure. The harder Soviet censors worked, the stronger grew underground papers, political jokes and public disbelief.</p><p>Criminal libel, which replaced pre-censorship in common-law countries, might be seditious, obscene or blasphemous. That threefold division tracked the silencers’ chief preoccupations: political dissent, fascination with sex and disregard for religion. Prosecutions continued even late into the 20th century. Especially before juries, they could backfire, as Mr Berkowitz recounts with relish. In 1817 William Hone was charged in Britain with blasphemy for parodying church liturgy. In defence, Hone read out passages of his parodies that so reduced the courtroom to laughter that acquittal was assured. Obscenity trials have commonly stumbled on the prosecution’s dilemma as to whether to say the unsayable or primly allude to it.</p><p>Entertaining as they are, court pratfalls were the exception. Mr Berkowitz stresses that suppression had the upper hand until recently. Free speech’s most eloquent modern champion, John Stuart Mill, published “On Liberty” in 1859; but in Europe and America state censorship weakened only in the 1950s-60s. Then and at other times, the law responded to public opinion. That is the second, indirect means by which speech may be silenced—or freed. Pressure may come from the majority view or (as now) from the sensitivities of ethno-religious minorities.</p><p>In America, where the First Amendment bars the government from limiting speech save on exceptional grounds, courts have tended to strike down post-1945 laws controlling “hate speech”. In Europe, by contrast, such laws are common and accepted even by free-speech liberals. Thus American courts are often said to be more “absolutist” about free expression. Mr Berkowitz corrects that half-truth, noting that American courts have upheld speech bans on pacifists in wartime and communists during the cold war.</p><p>Another indirect control turns on opportunities to speak. Even if all should be free to do so, must everyone be given a platform, a newspaper, an audience? To approach the question differently, does the gatekeeping power of media and web giants distort public argument?</p><p>Governments have stepped in at times to make the giants share their megaphones and refrained from interfering at others. Recently American regulators and courts have favoured the giants. Requirements for fairness in political broadcasting were dropped in the 1980s. A law of 1996 deemed web providers not to be publishers, hence protected from civil suits over material posted. The Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations enjoy free-speech protection, making limits on political spending, among other things, harder to enforce. Different social silencers, those now called no-platforming and “cancel culture”, make up in stridency what they lack in formal clout (though Mr Berkowitz thinks their significance is exaggerated).</p><p>Without always diving deep or giving clear answers, “Dangerous Ideas”shows that conflicts between free speech and censorship are rarely simple or settled for long. Above all, Mr Berkowitz grasps how quarrels over free speech are often, at bottom, fights for control of the argument. </p><p><a id="niche-services-are-connecting-iranian-artists-and-listeners"></a></p><h1 id="Niche-services-are-connecting-Iranian-artists-and-listeners"><a href="#Niche-services-are-connecting-Iranian-artists-and-listeners" class="headerlink" title="Niche services are connecting Iranian artists and listeners"></a>Niche services are connecting Iranian artists and listeners</h1><p>They flip the business model of streaming on its head</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The work of Mim Rasouli, a musician based near Tehran, is rich in Persian and Western influences. In “Fastalgia”, one of his best-known tunes, Mr Rasouli mashes up songs by Seyyed Javad Zabihi, a muezzin from the time of the shah; Mohammad Reza Shajarian, one of Iran’s greatest cultural treasures; Archive, an alt-rock band based in London; and Arms and Sleepers, a trip-hop group from Boston. The result is a dreamy, nostalgic track meant to evoke a time when the Ramadan fast began with Zabihi’s call to prayer and the iftar, or fast-breaking evening meal, was accompanied by Shajarian’s thundering voice.</p><p>Zabihi was murdered two years after the revolution of 1979; before he died last year Shajarian boycotted state radio to show support for pro-democracy protesters. Listeners can still stream their music on Spotify and similar services. But “Fastalgia” itself is not available. Nor is anything else by Mr Rasouli, or indeed any Iranian musicians living and working in Iran.</p><p>The reason is simple. Sanctions prevent Western companies from engaging in commercial relationships with Iranian entities or individuals. Mr Rasouli (pictured) says he would love to be on Spotify (itself not formally available in Iran), but instead puts his music online for nothing. His songs can be found on his personal website, YouTube, SoundCloud, Telegram and Navahang, a Persian-music streaming service. “I didn’t choose them,” Mr Rasouli says of this last outlet. Rather, after Navahang began posting his music of its own accord, he sent it more. He receives no payment in exchange.</p><p>Based in Finland, Navahang was set up in 2015 by Siavash Danesh, a refugee, with an app built in India. With roughly 2m users, it is a small outfit that focuses on the Iranian underground scene and female artists. The service is free; registration is not required. It carries advertising, but its size, and the fact that many listeners are in unprofitable Iran, mean revenues are modest.</p><p>To survive, Navahang flips the traditional business model of streaming. “Unlike other services like Spotify where you are getting subscriptions and paying artists,” says Mr Danesh, “we get money from the artists themselves.” Since Iran is not a signatory to assorted copyright treaties, platforms like Navahang can use some Iranian work without paying. Many musicians, including Mr Rasouli, are delighted with the exposure. Those in the diaspora who want Navahang to promote them, for example on the homepage, pay for the privilege. Navahang also produces music for some Persian artists based outside Iran. Mr Danesh reckons 90% of its income comes from these two sources.</p><p>Navahang is a relatively new entrant on the Persian-music streaming scene. The biggest and best-known service is Radio Javan, set up in Washington, dc in 2004. Its app has been downloaded more than 5m times on Google’s Play Store, many more than Navahang’s. Running a service aimed at Iranians is expensive, confirms Hamed Hashemi, Radio Javan’s founder. Not only are most users in Iran, but the lack of copyright protection cuts both ways. His company has a production arm, too, but it is hard to pursue claims when its music is bootlegged in Iran. Radio Javan alighted on the same strategy as Navahang. “We are a promotional company,” says Mr Hashemi. “We promote music.”</p><p>Think of it as targeted advertising. Persian musicians want to reach Persian-speaking listeners to secure record deals and gig bookings, in Tehran or elsewhere. The likelihood of being discovered or making much money on a mainstream service—Spotify carries over 1m artists and pays a fraction of a cent per stream—is low. For musicians in Iran, it is impossible. Paying for promotion on Navahang or Radio Javan is a way to reach the right audience.</p><p>But the benefits go wider. Iranian artists have long engaged with overseas music, as Mr Rasouli’s shows. Free Persian streaming services let the curious in the rest of the world discover culture originating in Iran. “As an artist, I like my work being seen and heard,” says Mr Rasouli. The rewards, he adds, are spiritual rather than material. </p><p><a id="obituary---yuan-longping-died-on-may-22nd"></a></p><h1 id="Obituary-—Yuan-Longping-died-on-May-22nd"><a href="#Obituary-—Yuan-Longping-died-on-May-22nd" class="headerlink" title="(Obituary)—Yuan Longping died on May 22nd"></a>(Obituary)—Yuan Longping died on May 22nd</h1><p>The Chinese agronomist who revolutionised rice production was 90</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>He was wandering in a ricefield of dreams. The plants were tall as sorghum, taller than a man. Their panicles hung full as brooms, and each grain was as big as a peanut. After walking a while he lay down in the leaf-shade with a friend, quite hidden. A rest was a good idea, because the wonder-plants went on and on. In fact, they covered the world.</p><p>Then Yuan Longping woke up, laughing. The rice plants he had tended for decades at Anjiang and then Changsha in Hunan province, sowing and nurturing them, visiting daily on his motorbike to inspect them, were not quite there yet. But they still deserved their name of super rice. The leaves were straighter and taller than ordinary, and the grains plumper. They had all the vigour of the wild strain that he and his team had found, after much searching, beside a railway line in Hainan in 1970 and had cross-bred, over careful years, with the domesticated variety. Sceptics told him he was wasting his time, since rice was a self-pollinator. He believed that cross-breeding was universal and, besides, that it always made the offspring stronger.</p><p>The figures spoke for themselves. With his new hybrid rice the annual yield was 20-30% higher. This meant that at least 60m more people could be fed every year. In Yunnan province more than 17,000 kilograms had been produced per hectare. China’s rice crop had risen from 57m tonnes in 1950 to 195m in 2017; from food deficiency, to food security. Higher rice-yields allowed farmers to turn more land to other uses—fruit, vegetables, fishponds—so that people not only ate more, but ate well. And this message was for the world, as well as China. Once his rice grew well, he sent seeds to the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Then he travelled widely, all across Asia and to Africa and America, as well as inviting foreign students to the Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Centre in Changsha to instruct them. A fifth of all rice grown globally now comes from hybrids that were his.</p><p>For this he won the Medal of the Republic, China’s highest, and the World Food Prize. An asteroid was named after him. There was talk of the Nobel, too. All that seemed just smoke to him. Though he was rich, from his shares in a seed company that used his name, he looked like a peasant, wiry as a twig, with his face leathered by sun and his big hands rough from “playing in the mud” all day. He was far happier in his short-sleeved work-shirts, out in his rice, or stripped off swimming in any wild river he could find, than in a tang suit in some conference hall. At social gatherings, he would offer round the first cigarettes and the nimblest jokes. When he lost at mahjong, no one was more delighted to pay the penalty of creeping through under the table.</p><p>Why he had become an agronomist was tricky to explain. His mother, whom he adored, did not want him to do it. He was a city boy anyway, born in Beijing, though he enjoyed the countryside and the thought of growing luscious things, like the grapes Charlie Chaplin could pick at his kitchen door in “Modern Times”. As he made his way to the Anjiang agricultural school, in a charcoal-fuelled bus struggling through the mountains, he had doubts himself. What settled his vocation was famine.</p><p>In 1949, at the founding of Communist China, he had first met hunger on the roads. Between 1959 and 1961, in Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward to collectivise farming, he saw country people falling down dying in the fields. They had been driven to eating tree-bark, fern-roots, even white clay. At the college, too, there was so little to eat that he barely had energy to dig. He dreamed of bowls of steamed fat pork, but woke to chew on rice bran. From that point his mission was to make sure people were fed.</p><p>Before the famine he had worked on grafting, because that was the Soviet model and Mao’s command. Crossbreeding of plants was forbidden and genes, ludicrously, were dismissed as “metaphysical”. So he grafted moonflowers on sweet potatoes, tomatoes on potatoes and a watermelon on a pumpkin (grotesque fruit, indescribable taste!), but found that any inherited traits vanished in the second generation. Secretly then he read Gregor Mendel on plant genetics, hiding him under the People’s Daily, and after 1960 he turned his full attention to China’s staple, rice.</p><p>He loved it in any case. As a boy he was enraptured by the deliciousness of xiaozhan rice from Tianjin, said to be the best in China. Around Anjiang, what the peasants wanted was quantity: miracle-yields from their fields. They would cross the mountains to get better seeds, so he did the same, traipsing round China to find the strong wild male-sterile plants he needed. Once he found them, in that unlikely spot in Hainan, it took three years to perfect the hybridising and another three to get his super rice into commercial production. Then, in a steep curve, yields soared away.</p><p>The Communist Party applauded him, but he never joined. He worried that, not understanding politics, he might say the wrong thing. In the Mao years at Anjiang he left indoctrination to other teachers, while he taught sports and how to sing Russian songs. The only concession he made to the Cultural Revolution was to give up his precious, then “decadent”, violin. Party officials called him “Comrade”, but he was no comrade of theirs, only of his agronomist colleagues and, he hoped, all hungry people. For their sake he kept on working to make rice better: salt-tolerant to grow by the coast, cross-bred with maize to be more nutritious, enriched with Vitamin a to improve people’s eyes. He fizzed with the thought that if just half of the 160m hectares of ricefields in the world were planted with his hybrid rice, an increase in yield of two tonnes per hectare would feed 500m more people every year. And he still talked, impishly, of plants taller than a man.</p><p>Outside the funeral home in Changsha on the day after his death, crowds came to lay a mountain of yellow and white chrysanthemums. Several of the mourners said that whenever they sat down to a meal, or merely smelled the fragrance of rice, they would remember “Grandfather Yuan”. Among the flowers were the traditional bowls of boiled rice, super-food for his journey. </p>]]></content>

But until May 23rd they thought they were safe in the West. That was when Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian journalist and activist, boarded a Ryanair jet that was due to fly from one eu country (Greece) to another (Lithuania). To his horror and the world’s astonishment, Belarus’s autocratic government hijacked it.</p><p>The plane was passing through Belarusian airspace and about to cross into Lithuania, where Mr Protasevich had been living in exile. Suddenly, the pilots were told there was a bomb on board. A mig-29 fighter jet was scrambled to intercept the plane and escort it to Minsk, Belarus’s capital, though this was not the nearest airport. On arrival Mr Protasevich was arrested, along with his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega.</p><p>No bomb was found. The alert was plainly a ploy. Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s dictator, has been rattled by mass protests against his theft of an election last year. Mr Protasevich co-founded Nexta (“someone” in Belarusian), an internet channel that covered, galvanised and in part organised those protests. He now faces a 15-year jail sentence. In a video “confession” Mr Protasevich, with a bruise on his forehead and part of his neck apparently covered by make-up, said he was being treated fairly. A similarly distressing video was aired of Ms Sapega, who is now being charged with instigating “mass disorder”.</p><p>Western governments competed to express their fury. The eu’s leaders demanded the release of the two young people, closed European airports to Belarus’s state airline and advised their own carriers to avoid its airspace. So did Britain. The most politically significant step came from neighbouring Ukraine, which banned the import of electricity from Belarus, placing itself squarely in the Western camp.</p><p>Britain, the eu and America are now working on new economic sanctions against Mr Lukashenko’s regime. Belarusian opposition leaders who live in exile, as those who are not in prison tend to, say it should include a boycott of Belarusian potash and petrochemicals, the country’s main exports, as well as many more travel bans and asset freezes on named individuals and state-controlled entities. Getting 27 eu members to agree on lists is likely to take time. But if Western leaders once held back because they reasoned that such moves would push Belarus closer to Russia, Mr Lukashenko’s actions have made their concerns less salient: his outrages have locked him firmly into Russia’s orbit.</p><p>The Kremlin is delighted. Margarita Simonyan, the boss of rt, Russia’s state propaganda channel, praised Mr Lukashenko’s piratical skills: “Never thought I would be jealous of Belarus. But now I am jealous. The old man has done it beautifully.” Russian tv channels disseminated the Belarusian dictator’s lies about the bomb threat having come from Hamas, which the eu designates as a Palestinian terrorist group. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, provided the rationale. “Russia will never leave Belarus in trouble…and will always come to the rescue of our neighbour and strategic ally. We have common history and spiritual values.”</p><p>The main commonality between the two regimes, however, is a fear of popular uprisings that might drive both from power. Last summer, as protests engulfed Belarus, it seemed that another “colour revolution” in a former Soviet state might topple another dictator. Vladimir Putin, who disapproves of such things, stepped in, offering economic help and pledging to provide security cadres to prop up Mr Lukashenko’s forces in case they wobbled. He also dispatched a team of Russians to take over parts of the Belarusian propaganda machine if necessary. The aim was not to empower Mr Lukashenko, whom he distrusts, but to secure his grip on Belarus, which he sees as an essential battleground in his confrontation with the West.</p><p>For years Mr Lukashenko had cleverly played Russia against the West, blackmailing both to extract money. When Mr Putin pushed for a deeper union between Russia and Belarus two years ago, so that he could preside over a new empire, Mr Lukashenko resisted, taking on the unlikely role of champion of Belarusian independence. But by stealing the election and then ordering the mass arrests, mass beatings and mass torture of those who objected, he has destroyed the last speck of legitimacy he had at home and alienated the foreign powers that had previously tolerated him. Now he has only one possible ally left, a judo enthusiast in Moscow.</p><p>The melding together of Russia and a once-reluctant Belarus continues. Mr Putin met Mr Lukashenko on April 22nd and praised progress in deepening the “union state” between the two countries. A few days earlier, Russia’s fsb, the security service that now plays a dominant role in Russian politics, said it had co-operated with the Belarusian kgb (as it is still called) to uncover a Western plot to assassinate Mr Lukashenko. Whichever country came up with this conspiracy theory, Mr Putin cited it last month in a telephone conversation with Joe Biden, whom he is to meet in Geneva on June 16th.</p><p>In Belarus the plot was instantly turned into a propaganda film, “To Kill the President”. In the words of Nikolai Karpenkov, one of Mr Lukashenko’s generals, it “clearly showed that this soft, kind opposition fighting for peaceful changes are in fact bloody-minded dogs preparing a military coup, murder and kidnapping.” The Belarusian security services claimed they were, in fact, fighting terror, rather than propagating it: “We are ready to act. As soon as the order comes, we will find and purge them…we will make the world freer.” Hijacking the Ryanair flight to arrest Mr Protasevich was part of the “counter-terrorist” operation that stems from this deepening collaboration with Russia, and was perhaps also intended to secure Belarus financial assistance in the event of harsher sanctions; a cynical deal indeed.</p><p>Belarus is testing new limits to what Freedom House, an American ngo, calls “transnational repression”. Authoritarian regimes such as those in Russia, China and Rwanda have long targeted domestic dissidents beyond their borders. Some will now be tempted to copy Mr Lukashenko’s novel tactics. Exiled dissidents of every nationality will be more nervous about boarding planes. Belarusian dissidents will wonder if they are safe flying over Russia, which is much harder to avoid than their homeland. When Mr Biden meets Mr Putin in three weeks’ time, the democrat and the despot will have even more to discuss. </p><p><a id="russia-puts-the-czech-republic-on-an-official-enemies-list"></a></p><h1 id="Russia-puts-the-Czech-Republic-on-an-official-enemies-list"><a href="#Russia-puts-the-Czech-Republic-on-an-official-enemies-list" class="headerlink" title="Russia puts the Czech Republic on an official enemies list"></a>Russia puts the Czech Republic on an official enemies list</h1><p>Its sin was to have blamed Russian agents for a deadly blast on Czech soil</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Unlike teenagers, countries rarely write down lists of their enemies. But Russia does. On May 14th it published a list of “unfriendly countries”. Oddly, it had only two names on it: the United States and the Czech Republic. The latter was unexpected, but explicable. In April the Czech government revealed that a deadly explosion in 2014 at an ammunition depot in the town of Vrbetice, previously thought accidental, was set off by Russian agents. (Some of the ammunition was destined for Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed rebels.) The Czechs and Russians have since expelled dozens of each others’ diplomats. Relations are now as sour as at any time since the Soviet Union collapsed (though not as bad as in 1968, when Moscow’s tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia to overthrow a reformist government).</p><p>That is inconvenient for the Kremlin. It needs friends inside the eu to stave off further sanctions over its latest misdeeds. Although most Czechs distrust Russia, it has long been able to count on the Czech president, Milos Zeman, a cantankerous populist who likes to set off explosions of a rhetorical kind. Mr Zeman questioned his own country’s intelligence agencies for blaming the blast on Russia. During a visit by Serbia’s president on May 18th he abruptly begged forgiveness for nato’s bombardment of Belgrade in 1999, clearly trying to suggest that the Russians are not the only ones who go around blowing things up.</p><p>Mr Zeman also called Russia’s enemy list “silly”, and his powers as president are limited. But the government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis is hanging by a thread. The Czech Communist Party, an unreformed Russia-friendly outfit that has 8% of the seats in parliament, stopped backing the coalition in April, depriving it of its majority. If Mr Babis falls, Mr Zeman could decide who will run a caretaker government until an election in October.</p><p>The biggest consequence of the feud involves an upgrade to the nuclear power plant at Dukovany, originally built by the Soviet Union. The state power company plans to build at least one new reactor by 2036 for €6bn ($7.3bn), though analysts fear the cost may be twice as high. After the Vrbetice affair the government announced that Rosatom, the Russian nuclear consortium, had been excluded from bidding.</p><p>However, experts say that Russian companies have only been kicked out of the initial phase, and could end up winning contracts later. Having built Dukovany, they have an advantage over their competitors, France’s edf, South Korea’s khnp and the Japanese-American firm Westinghouse. “If you ask Czech engineers, they mostly say they would be for the Russians,” says Martin Jirusek, an energy industry expert at Masaryk University.</p><p>Czech views of Russia have often see-sawed. Last spring the two countries tussled over the removal of a statue of a Soviet general, Marshal Konev, hailed for liberating the country from the Nazis in 1945 but then reviled for planning the invasion in 1968. But views of the West can be wary as well. A survey in 2020 by cvvm, a pollster, found that by a two-to-one margin Czechs are glad that their country is a nato member, but they are split almost evenly on whether that is a guarantee of independence or a form of subjugation to foreign powers. Enemies list or no, some Czechs are still reluctant to take sides. </p><p><a id="the-hidden-side-to-french-suburban-living"></a></p><h1 id="The-hidden-side-to-French-suburban-living"><a href="#The-hidden-side-to-French-suburban-living" class="headerlink" title="The hidden side to French suburban living"></a>The hidden side to French suburban living</h1><p>What politicians in Paris might learn from the area around it</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Cutting through farmland in a regional nature park, the approach to La Chapelle-en-Vexin is dominated not by its 12th-century chapel but by newly built two-storey homes. With their dormer windows, sloping tiled roofs and neatly hedged gardens, houses on such lotissements offer a French version of American suburban life: play space for children, a deck for the barbecue, and—crucially—off-street parking. In this village of just 333 inhabitants, an off-plan three-bedroom house with a garage is on sale for €260,000 ($320,000)—the same as a gloomy bedsit in central Paris.</p><p>Only 65km (40 miles) separate La Chapelle-en-Vexin from the cobbled boulevards of the French capital. Both belong to the greater Paris region, Île-de-France. Yet daily concerns could not be more different.</p><p>The suburban rer express line does not reach this far. Fully 85% of residents drive to work. Villagers worry about pollution. A big local issue is an effort to get a bypass built to divert heavy traffic from driving through the centre. But roads sustain daily life. Shopping is done by car at a hypermarket. Nobody in the village uses a bicycle to get to work. “We don’t feel close to Paris at all,” says Joëlle Valenchon, the mayor: “We are a bit forgotten.”</p><p>The French capital, with 2.2m people, is dwarfed by its region, home to 12.2m. Some 3m-4m of them live on its semi-rural edges. Such places, where 87% of trips are made by car, feel a world away from the capital’s concerns. Politics in Paris, governed by Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist backed by the Greens, is increasingly about bike-sharing, pedestrianisation, the végétalisation (greening) of concrete spaces and rooftop micro-farming. Paris aspires to be a “15-minute city”, a concept developed by Carlos Moreno, an urban planner. The idea is that everything—school, work, shops, sport, cafés—should be within 15 minutes from home on foot, or five minutes by bike. “Mine is actually more like a two-minute city,” says a Paris city-dweller, who rents an electric bike for more distant excursions.</p><p>The disconnect between Paris and the outer reaches of its region has political implications. One is that Ms Hidalgo, who is seen as an anti-car crusader and could run for the French presidency next year, may find it hard to appeal far beyond the périphérique. The Paris ring-road, built half a century ago, has turned into a gigantic concrete symbol of the capital’s division from its suburbs. Life on the lotissements on the region’s outer fringe has more in common with the villages and towns across France than it does with central Paris.</p><p>Divergent geographical interests also help explain why efforts over the years to merge the overlapping and competing administrative structures governing Paris and the region have come to little. As it is, the capital seems quite happy not to run the troubled banlieues, with their brutalist housing estates, which ring Paris itself. The semi-rural communes are more neglected still. “For 30 years the capital’s growth has benefited the nearer suburbs, but it has also reinforced the contrast with the outer periphery,” says Aurélien Delpirou, of the École d’Urbanisme de Paris.</p><p>The other Marine<br>The fringes of greater Paris carry a political warning too. At elections to the European Parliament in 2019, the Greens’ vote was concentrated in central Paris. A big swathe of the outer fringe, however, voted for Marine Le Pen’s populist National Rally. Studies by Hervé Le Bras, a geographer, show that the National Rally’s vote tends to rise with distance from a railway station. Isolation and fear of crime play a part, as does a sense that government ignores rural voters’ problems. At regional elections next month, the National Rally’s candidate, Jordan Bardella, is Ms Le Pen’s young deputy.</p><p>The campaign for the Île-de-France captures the rift between Paris and its region. Valérie Pécresse, the sitting centre-right regional president, is the favourite. All candidates with more than 10% go through to a run-off, where she may face both Mr Bardella and a candidate on the left, possibly the Greens’ Julien Bayou (the candidate of President Emmanuel Macron is polling fourth). Ms Pécresse, who moved the region’s headquarters from Paris to the suburbs, has distanced herself from Parisian politicians. She opposes the pedestrianisation of parts of central Paris, as it has pushed congestion and pollution out to the periphery. The fashionably bearded Mr Bayou, meanwhile, got into trouble last month for posters aimed at young voters, which hinted that “hunters” and “boomers” were not interested in climate change.</p><p>Greenery is at the heart of this tension, and competing interests are complex. In Marines, a small town with a cobbled central square, residents cherish the environment as well as their cars. Daniel Hermand, who works at the town hall, says he quit Paris for a calmer life close to nature and forests. If the pandemic and consequent home-working push more families out, they may bring their hobbies and politics with them. So Ms Pécresse has taken care to sound eco-friendly too. She has launched an electric-bike rental scheme, and promises a network of bicycle routes to match those of the rer train lines.</p><p>“Of course it’s good for people to use bicycles,” says Othman Nasrou, Ms Pécresse’s deputy. “But environmental policy can’t be to the detriment of those who need to use their cars.” Mr Macron learned this the hard way when gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) launched huge protests against a rise in tax on motor fuel. It is not fashionable politics to listen to car owners, nor to the quiet concerns of those on the fringes. But the lotissements of greater Paris and their voting habits suggest that policymakers who unthinkingly punish the car-dependent do so at their peril. </p><p><a id="how-farmers-still-rule-europe"></a></p><h1 id="How-farmers-still-rule-Europe"><a href="#How-farmers-still-rule-Europe" class="headerlink" title="How farmers still rule Europe"></a>How farmers still rule Europe</h1><p>Politicians dare not crimp their exorbitant privileges</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Armed with a device designed for throwing tennis balls for dogs, it is possible to launch an egg a very satisfying 60 metres. Head to the Quartier Leopold in Brussels on the right day and you can see farmers from across Europe firing a wide range of produce an impressive distance at Belgian riot police. It is during these regular protests at the European Union’s headquarters that the ingenuity, bravery and diligence of the European farmer truly shows itself. In one episode a pair of tractors slowly drove through a barbed-wire barricade, as cops scattered. When an armoured police van turned up, the farmers drove into that too. It took two water cannons at full blast to make the tractors retreat. Over the years, grumpy farmers have covered stoic Belgian riot police in hay, eggs, and milk direct from the udder.</p><p>A riot can be the voice of the unheard. It can also be a tantrum of the ludicrously privileged. European farmers are politically powerful in the same way that the sky is blue: it is a fact so universally acknowledged that it is usually not worth mentioning. This power was apparent this week in the final negotiations between diplomats, members of the European Parliament and officials over the terms under which farmers will receive €270bn ($330bn) in 2023-27. That the farmers will get the cash is a given. The debate is about how many conditions will be attached, with the options ranging from not a lot to very few indeed.</p><p>The Common Agricultural Policy (cap) is a tumour in the eu’s body politic. Sucking up a third of the group’s budget, it is a neat illustration of its struggle to change itself for the better. What began six decades ago as a quid pro quo between France and Germany (farming bungs in exchange for market access) is still in place. It is an odd form of redistribution. About 20% of farms get 80% of the money. Aristocrats, agri-giants and the Catholic church all take a juicy cut. Companies linked to Andrej Babis, the billionaire Czech prime minister, got €34m ($42m) one year. Money is shifted from European taxpayers to landowners, in a frankly feudal farce. Usually, there is a pretence that things will improve. This time, the European Commission has given up. “We have to acknowledge that there will be no revolution in the cap,” said Frans Timmermans, the commissioner tasked with making Europe greener.</p><p>History is littered with once-mighty interest groups that have withered. Coalminers in Germany and Poland will have cash thrown at them as their industries are phased out as part of the plan for a “just transition” to a green economy. But this amounts to a free bar at a wake. By contrast, farmers remain as powerful as ever. Partly this is down to the nature of food. People care more about what they put in their mouths than how they heat their homes or the bodywork of their Audis. Unlike coal or steel, food is not truly fungible. An Italian may spurn a tomato from Spain, never mind one flown in from Morocco, or a genetically modified American one. For a continent without a common tongue, snobbery about domestic produce provides a universal language.</p><p>The way the eu cooks up agricultural policy helps farmers keep their outsized power. Normally, policymaking in Brussels is a bazaar, with everything for sale at the right price. Officials from countries haggle with each other, surrendering on one topic to get what they want on another file. As a system it is opaque, but it works. By contrast, farming is insulated from the other subjects of haggling, sealed off in its own special committee. The result is that governments try to grab as much cash as they can, rather than question whether it should be there in the first place.</p><p>For all the talk of the eu’s democratic deficit, agriculture is an area where the eu suffers from a surplus of democracy. Dead-eyed technocrats would happily chop farming subsidies. European politicians will not let them. In France any self-respecting presidential candidate must spend time sniffing cheese at agricultural fairs. Farming generates barely 1% of European gdp. But its fate has outsized importance. Rather than left or right, the political battleground across much of Europe is a fight between urban centres and the rural periphery. Britain’s exit removed one of the few big governments that was less neuralgic about the future of farming (as its current enthusiasm for free-trade deals with agricultural powerhouses like Australia attests). For most of the eu, slashing subsidies would be an assault on a politically potent rural hinterland. It is a fight few want to have.</p><p>Farmers versus Swedish teenagers<br>Luckily, some do. Greta Thunberg, a young Swedish climate activist, has joined a cabal of ngos hammering the eu for not doing enough to curb agriculture’s environmental effects. At the moment, whatever ambition the eu has for climate policy melts away when it comes to farming, even though its emissions rival much heavier industries. Farmers can no longer brush off the concern. Environmental policy has gone from the hobby-horse of sandal-wearers to an existential policy debate. From now on, the farmers will have a fight on their hands. Things can get better. After all, the cap used to be even worse. The days when European taxpayers paid to overproduce products that were then dumped on poor countries are over. But it took years of concerted campaigning to shift the butter mountains and the wine lakes.</p><p>It is too late to make a difference this time, as talks over the €270bn come to a close. A slow grinding fight led by the likes of Ms Thunberg is necessary if the cap is to be overhauled. Ensuring that farmers do their bit for the climate, and stopping the transfer of cash to those who do not need it would be a start. The story of European policymaking is one of path dependency in which errors take years (and usually a big crisis) to unpick. Until then, the cap will remain a scar on the eu, a visible reminder of how hard it is to undo past mistakes. Should it ever look like being fixed, though, it will be wise to avoid the eu quarter in Brussels. Imagine how grumpy the farmers will be if they actually lose for once. </p><p><a id="britain---the-bbc-has-bigger-problems-than-a-misbehaving-interviewer"></a></p><h1 id="Britain-—The-BBC-has-bigger-problems-than-a-misbehaving-interviewer"><a href="#Britain-—The-BBC-has-bigger-problems-than-a-misbehaving-interviewer" class="headerlink" title="(Britain)—The BBC has bigger problems than a misbehaving interviewer"></a>(Britain)—The BBC has bigger problems than a misbehaving interviewer</h1><p>It is caught between rich American rivals and an unsympathetic government</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Relations between the British Broadcasting Corporation and the government have always been delicate. Stanley Baldwin bridled at the bbc’s coverage of the General Strike of 1926. Margaret Thatcher was infuriated by its reporting from the Falklands. Hugh Carleton Greene, the corporation’s boss in the 1960s, confessed that, when dealing with Harold Wilson’s government, “I found my experience as head of psychological warfare in Malaya in 1947 extremely useful.”</p><p>The latest spat pits the bbc against not just Downing Street but the royal family, as well as many viewers. An independent inquiry released on May 20th found that one of its most famous scoops, an interview in 1995 in which Princess Diana claimed that “there were three of us in this marriage”, was secured partly by deception. Martin Bashir, the interviewer, forged documents to persuade the princess that she was being spied on. A bbc probe at the time led by Tony Hall, who later became director-general, covered it up.</p><p>The bbc promises a review of its editorial practices and another report into its dealings with Mr Bashir, who left the corporation earlier this month citing ill-health. Two former executives, including Lord Hall, have quit their new jobs. Prince William declared the revelations proof that the interview “established a false narrative” about his mother. The government is drawing broader lessons. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, wrote in the Rupert Murdoch-owned Times newspaper that the bbc needed “a new emphasis on accuracy, impartiality and diversity of opinion”. To avoid “groupthink”, he said, “cultural change must be a focus”.</p><p>Conservative politicians have long suspected the bbc of closet liberal leanings. Boris Johnson’s government uses the “Brexit-Bashing Corporation” as a punchbag, as part of a strategy of drawing cultural dividing lines rather than economic ones. But the real danger posed by political skirmishes such as that over Mr Bashir is one of distraction. The more the bbc focuses on government assaults, the less it is able to cope with bigger threats emanating mostly from America.</p><p>More than six out of ten British homes now subscribe to an American video-streaming service. The result is more competition for eyeballs. In the past decade Britons have gone from watching four hours a day of broadcast television to just under three. Among under-35s, broadcast tv accounts for less than a third of video viewing (see chart).</p><p>The bbc is good at new media. Its website is Britain’s fourth-most visited after Google, YouTube and Facebook. The iPlayer streaming service, which the bbc launched in 2007 (the same year Netflix began streaming) is used by more people in Britain than any subscription platform. It is not enough. In 2019 under-35s spent less than an hour a day consuming bbc output, across television, radio and the internet, down by 17 minutes in just two years.</p><p>The compulsory licence fee through which it is funded is not cheap: at £159 ($225) a year, it would be enough for a basic subscription to both Netflix and Disney+, with money left over for popcorn. But the bbc is limited to about 25m fee-paying households and cannot borrow. Streaming companies have the world to fish in—Netflix has over 200m subscribers, Disney+ 100m—and are willing to lose money for years in the pursuit of market share. Whereas the bbc commissioned £2.8bn of content in 2020, Netflix and Disney+ have a combined budget this year of more than $20bn. Amazon recently earmarked nearly half a billion dollars for a single “Lord of the Rings” series.</p><p>Commercial media outfits are rushing to bulk up. WarnerMedia, creator of “Game of Thrones”, “Harry Potter” and other hits, has announced plans to merge with Discovery. France’s largest and third-largest channels, tf1 and m6, will also try to merge, to provide une réponse française to the Americans. The bbc has teamed up with itv, Britain’s biggest commercial broadcaster, to run BritBox, an international streaming service. With 2.6m subscribers it is a minnow.</p><p>The last stronghold<br>No big streamer does news, an area where the bbc remains strong. Last year 70% of Britons with internet access said they had absorbed its reports in one medium or another during the past week, according to the Reuters Institute at Oxford University; among 18- to 24-year-olds the figure was 51%. This represents a drop since 2015, when 79% of all adults and 68% of young people tuned in. But the bbc remains “undoubtedly, and by a massive margin” the main source of news in Britain, says Rasmus Nielsen of the Reuters Institute.</p><p>The corporation is at least stronger than other national broadcasters, which have seen similar declines in reach. Fully 86% of Britons say they are satisfied with their public-service media, versus between 50% and 61% of French, German, Spanish and Italian viewers. For all his complaining about the bbc, “Boris is intelligent enough to see that shutting it down would backfire,” says one senior Tory. The elderly, who make up the core of the Conservative vote, remain bbc addicts. And Mr Johnson’s healthy poll ratings mean he owes no favours to Mr Murdoch, who has long lobbied for the corporation to be trimmed.</p><p>Still, as the variety of entertainment from streamers grows, a compulsory levy to fund comedy, drama and the like looks odd. In the age of linear viewing, public-service broadcasters had to combine news with lighter fare to get people to tune in. The on-demand era has decoupled the two, making it harder to argue that everyone should pay for “Strictly Come Dancing”. Expect a smaller, newsier bbc in future—and direct the blame, or credit, not to Westminster but to Hollywood.</p><p><a id="britain%E2%80%99s-trade-deals-lack-transparency"></a></p><h1 id="Britain’s-trade-deals-lack-transparency"><a href="#Britain’s-trade-deals-lack-transparency" class="headerlink" title="Britain’s trade deals lack transparency"></a>Britain’s trade deals lack transparency</h1><p>A row over the latest, with Australia, shows why negotiators must be more open</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Cabinet splits always excite Westminster. So it proved after the Financial Times reported a bust-up between Liz Truss, the trade secretary, and George Eustice, the environment secretary, over a planned free-trade deal with Australia. At issue was Ms Truss’s desire to offer Australian beef-producers unlimited tariff- and quota-free access to the British market, upsetting Mr Eustice’s farmers. Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, said such an agreement would throw British family farms “under a bus”. Boris Johnson eventually came down on Ms Truss’s side after invoking the free-trade heritage of another Conservative prime minister, Robert Peel.</p><p>The prime minister is right to have done so. Brexit has created an opportunity to escape the European Union’s costly system of farm protection and to strike more adventurous trade deals with third countries. The Australians insisted on far more generous access for beef and lamb as the price of any agreement. And, as Ms Truss asked rhetorically: if Britain cannot strike a free-trade deal with an old friend like Australia, who can it do deals with?</p><p>For all the noisy opposition of farmers (especially in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) the quantities involved are small. Ms Truss’s trade department estimates that the entire deal with Australia would add a maximum of just 0.02% to gdp in the long term. Last year Britain imported some 560 tonnes of beef and veal from Australia. Were that number to rise tenfold, as Australian producers hope, it would still be less than 3% of more than 200,000 tonnes imported from the eu each year. Ms Truss also promises a 15-year transition before tariffs and quotas are lifted in full. A more justifiable fear for British farmers, suggests Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, is that the deal becomes a model for bigger future ones with Latin America and the United States. Yet such deals are far off and could be debated on their merits.</p><p>The argument has revealed the absence of a trade strategy. Brexiteers say they want free trade everywhere. Yet they remain shtum about the barriers erected with Britain’s biggest trading partner, the eu. Almost all the trade deals done by Ms Truss so far have been rollovers of those formerly in place through Britain’s eu membership. Australia would be the first significant new one. But why is the focus of such deals so much on farming (or in some cases fish), which are tiny shares of a gdp that is 80% composed of services? How is Britain going to lead the charge towards greater liberalisation of services trade around the world?</p><p>Indeed, argues David Henig of ecipe, a think-tank focused on trade, it seems as if the only post-Brexit strategy is to sign free-trade deals as quickly as possible. That fosters a sense of desperation, which puts Britain in a weak bargaining position against some of the world’s toughest negotiators. The latest deal appears to be of greater benefit to Australia than it is to Britain. Just wait for the battle that is likely with the Americans, who take no prisoners in trade talks.</p><p>That points to another concern over the deal: the lack of transparency in negotiating it. Public support for free trade is often fragile, because producers who lose out shout louder than consumers who gain. Protests from special interests, greens and others have often sunk free-trade negotiations, ranging from Seattle in 1999 through Doha in 2008 to a planned transatlantic trade and investment partnership in 2016. Yet the British government conducts its negotiations, including those affecting controversial food-safety standards, largely in secret. Parliamentary scrutiny is allowed only after trade deals are signed.</p><p>The risk of this triggering a popular backlash against freer trade is all the greater because of the government’s reputation. Ms Batters’s adverse reaction to the Australian trade deal was so strong partly because she claims that Mr Johnson promised he would die rather than sell farmers down the river in order to secure trade deals. She is not the first, and will not be the last, to discover that the prime minister has a habit of making promises that he does not intend to keep.</p><p><a id="the-square-mile-is-a-ghost-town-it-will-stay-that-way"></a></p><h1 id="The-Square-Mile-is-a-ghost-town-It-will-stay-that-way"><a href="#The-Square-Mile-is-a-ghost-town-It-will-stay-that-way" class="headerlink" title="The Square Mile is a ghost town.

In 1857 Building News, an architectural journal, declared that “except for business purposes, the City may be said to be now uninhabited”. These days fewer than 10,000 people make their homes in the Square Mile, although its pubs, restaurants and barbers were created to serve the 542,000 who normally work in the district. By comparison, New York’s somewhat larger financial district has 64,000 residents and 307,000 daily workers.</p><p>The Square Mile is quiet even compared with other parts of central London. In the West End, the number of people leaving Oxford Circus Underground station during the working week stands at 35% of the level in early March 2020, just before covid-19 struck. Bank station, in the City, is only 15% as busy as it was. Offices in the financial district are sitting empty. cbre, a large property manager, puts the vacancy rate at 12.4%. The highest it reached after the financial crisis was 9.4%.</p><p>The City of London Corporation has created a £50m ($70m) fund to assist small businesses. It has also announced plans to build 1,500 new homes over the next decade. But its core recovery plan is to promote the City as a business hub, and entice white-collar workers back.</p><p>The success of Britain’s vaccination programme notwithstanding, that will be difficult. In New Zealand, almost a year after the lifting of most pandemic restrictions, 62% of financial-services employees say they are working at least one day a week from home, and 26% are not visiting their offices at all. Three economists, José María Barrero, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis, have studied American white-collar workers. They estimate that employees paid between $100,000 and $150,000 will spend 35% of their working hours at home. Those paid over $150,000 (which is true of many financial-services workers) will toil from home 43% of the time—just over two days a week.</p><p>Although a few banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are hounding employees back into offices, most firms in London expect a blend of home and office working. But that will be hard to implement. Nick South of the Boston Consulting Group points out that because few white-collar workers are members of just one team, it is hard to draw up rotas that allow for both face-to-face collaboration and remote work. Employees may end up dialling in by default. And employee surveys routinely show that some people are extremely reluctant to return to the office. “You ignore these people at your peril,” says Mr South.</p><p>One clue to how London’s financial-services firms will respond comes from the property market. Mat Oakley of Savills, an estate agent, says that 96% of office space let in the Square Mile so far in 2021 has been grade a, meaning it is of high quality and built in the last ten years. The historical average is 65%. Firms seem to have concluded that in order to entice workers back, they will have to offer them plusher surroundings.</p><p><a id="a-drive-to-make-nature-writing-more-working-class"></a></p><h1 id="A-drive-to-make-nature-writing-more-working-class"><a href="#A-drive-to-make-nature-writing-more-working-class" class="headerlink" title="A drive to make nature writing more working-class"></a>A drive to make nature writing more working-class</h1><p>It has been bourgeois since John Clare</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“We can see cow parsley,” says the nature writer Natasha Carthew, standing next to the river in Bath. “Nettles, thistle…” Today, however, Ms Carthew is more interested in a different species: the modern nature writer. This breed, she says, can be recognised by its distinctive winter coat (a “tweed jacket”); by its “lamenting” cry as it talks about sunsets and whatnot; and by its frequent appearance in particular habitats, namely “the moors, the Lakes, the Peaks” and “the Robert Macfarlane table in Waterstones”.</p><p>The entire publishing industry has been colonised by the middle and upper classes. A study last year of literary types found that only 13% came from a working-class background. So Ms Carthew has launched the “Nature Writing Prize for working-class writers”, now in its second year, to “burst the stereotype of what it means to be a nature writer” and allow other species to thrive.</p><p>Emoting in the open air might seem an egalitarian pursuit. Fields are free, while pens and paper cost mere pennies. It is not so simple, says Ms Carthew. One cannot wander lonely as a cloud if one is working in a call centre, and it is easier to write about the questing vole in a plashy fen if one owns the fen. Such accusations make the publishing industry squirm: like most liberal elites, publishers are happier to be seen as liberal than elite. Steps therefore are being taken. Surveys have been conducted, working-class networks have been launched, hands have been wrung. There remains an uncomfortably large number of people in the industry called Sophie.</p><p>The question of who actually is working class in Britain is tricky. The nature-writing prize is open to those who “self-identify” as working class. Partly, says Ms Carthew, this is “just easier. I’m not going to have a tickbox… Council house? Single parent?” Her approach also reflects a significant social and cultural change. For many Britons today, class is less a state of employment than a state of mind. Although the proportion of Britons employed in working-class jobs has declined in recent decades (it now hovers around 25%) a study conducted by academics at Oxford University found that the share of British people identifying as working class remains stable, at around 60%.</p><p>“We like to identify with groups that are viewed as disadvantaged. There is almost a one-downmanship with all this,” says Jonathan Rose, author of “The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes”. For working-class nature writers however, history offers hope. Britain has a fine tradition of celebrating such authors, who were believed—with reason—to know their physical environment intimately. The poet John Clare may have been, as the subtitle of his books proclaimed, a “Northamptonshire Peasant Poet” but was wined and dined by literary London (he winced at the sound of his hobnailed boots on its marble floors).</p><p>Back at the river, Ms Carthew argues that widening access will widen the genre. She writes not merely about sublime sunsets but about concrete and crumbling railways. She points to a homeless shelter beside the river: “To me that’s nature.” The man within might, she suggests, be a poet too. When questioned by The Economist the man demurs. He is, he confirms, a passionate nature lover. He loves to watch the cormorants. He does not write about nature. “I just enjoy it. Because that’s what we’re supposed to do.”</p><p><a id="the-pandemic-has-seen-a-surprising-surge-in-cash-use"></a></p><h1 id="The-pandemic-has-seen-a-surprising-surge-in-cash-use"><a href="#The-pandemic-has-seen-a-surprising-surge-in-cash-use" class="headerlink" title="The pandemic has seen a surprising surge in cash use"></a>The pandemic has seen a surprising surge in cash use</h1><p>Look to the black economy</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Even before covid-19, a surprising quantity of coins and banknotes were at large in Britain. The rise of internet shopping and contactless payment cards pushed the share of transactions involving physical money down from over two-thirds in the early 2000s to under a quarter by 2019. Yet over the same period the value of banknotes in circulation rose from just over 2% of gdp to over 3%. Demand for cash as a medium of exchange has fallen but demand for physical money as a store of value has more than compensated. And over the past 15 months, even as many pubs and retailers have insisted on cashless payment, the amount of money in circulation has risen even further (see chart).</p><p>A decade of low inflation and extremely low interest rates explains some of the appeal of old-fashioned notes. The opportunity cost of keeping savings in a liquid but non-interest-bearing form has rarely been lower. But that cannot explain the jump in the amount of money in circulation since March 2020.</p><p>Graham Moody of link, the company that runs Britain’s atm network, says that cash machines were busy in the days before the first national lockdown in March 2020. Panicked consumers stockpiled money at the same time as they emptied supermarkets of toilet paper and pasta. After that, he says, “usage fell like a stone”. Total withdrawals from cash machines between April and December 2020 were 35% lower than the year before. But as the amount of cash entering circulation fell, the amount leaving circulation fell even faster.</p><p>It is likely that some of the extra notes are not actually changing hands. Saving rates have been historically high since the pandemic began, and some of that is probably in the form of physical money. Households and small businesses have made fewer trips to the bank, just as they have made fewer trips of all kinds. Some of the cash that would have normally been paid into bank accounts is probably sitting in wallets and tills.</p><p>But there is another, more worrying, explanation for the surge in cash. Treasury officials suspect that much of the rise has been caused by growth in the undeclared cash-in-hand economy since the early months of 2020. Four million Britons are still furloughed from their jobs; some of them are no doubt looking to top up their incomes. For those who choose to work in the shadows, cash is still king.</p><p><a id="international---joe-biden-orders-his-spooks-to-investigate-the-origins-of-covid-19"></a></p><h1 id="International-—Joe-Biden-orders-his-spooks-to-investigate-the-origins-of-covid-19"><a href="#International-—Joe-Biden-orders-his-spooks-to-investigate-the-origins-of-covid-19" class="headerlink" title="(International)—Joe Biden orders his spooks to investigate the origins of covid-19"></a>(International)—Joe Biden orders his spooks to investigate the origins of covid-19</h1><p>How can the world prepare for a future pandemic when it does not know for sure where the current one came from?</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In march, President Joe Biden asked his spooks how the covid-19 pandemic had started. Contradicting claims made last year by Donald Trump, who said the intelligence services had shown him very strong evidence on the matter, they told him that they did not know. So on May 26th he asked them again, publicly this time, admonishing them to try harder and to report back in 90 days.</p><p>This is a direct rebuke to China’s secretive government. When experts convened by the World Health Organisation (who) travelled to Wuhan, the city where covid-19 was first identified, in January and February this year their hosts refused to share crucial data. A senior Biden administration official said recently that he found those efforts to “undermine serious investigations” into the pandemic’s beginnings particularly troubling, and that they left “many more questions than answers”.</p><p>At the crux of this distrust is the possibility that sars-cov-2, the virus which causes covid-19, may have emerged accidentally from research on animal coronaviruses conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (wiv) or another nearby lab. In early 2020 this idea, sometimes conflated with the idea that the virus had been developed as a biological weapon, was publicly dismissed by eminent scientists. In February 2020 a number of them used the pages of the Lancet, a medical journal, “to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid-19 does not have a natural origin”. Most in the media followed their line. By far the most plausible account of covid-19’s origins, they reported, was “zoonotic spillover”—that is, a virus jumping unaided from animals to humans, as is taken to have been the case for sars, a disease caused by a different coronavirus, in 2002. Lab-leak theories were widely dismissed as conspiracy-mongering.</p><p>In the past few months, though, discussion of lab-leakery has gained currency among politicians and policy elites and in the mainstream media, as well as in influential blog posts by science reporters. This is in part because of the departures of Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state, who promoted the theory with gusto. To be able to consider the possibility without giving them succour will have made it easier for some.</p><p>But the resurgence is not a purely political phenomenon. On May 13th Science, a journal, published a letter from a group of senior scientists who had not previously weighed in on the matter arguing that “theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable”. In this they were taking the same position as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the who’s boss, who refused to rule out the possibility of a laboratory origin after the who mission in January and February was stonewalled, and has since called for further inquiry.</p><p>This is not going down well in China. On May 21st, at a Global Health Summit convened by the eu and g20, Xi Jinping, China’s president, urged world leaders to “firmly reject any attempt to politicise” the covid-19 pandemic. On May 25th China’s representative at the World Health Assembly, the who’s decision-making body, said the country considered the inquiry into the origins complete and that the focus should shift to other countries, strongly suggesting that it would not accommodate further investigation.</p><p>High on the assembly’s agenda were responses to the current pandemic and the prevention of future ones. Felicity Harvey, chair of an oversight committee for the who’s Health Emergencies Programme, said that new virus threats must in future be handled with more transparency, better data-sharing and an ability to give informal early warnings to the world. Earlier in May a who panel of experts recommended that countries be placed under a greater obligation to report new outbreaks and that the who’s authority to seek out and share relevant information with the world be strengthened.</p><p>It would be surprising if China (and, indeed, some other countries) were to accept all these ideas. Its leadership has consistently fought to deny international bodies the right to stick their noses into the affairs of sovereign countries, and it does not always welcome the who’s attentions. In 2018 it declined requests from American officials, made under who guidelines, for lab samples of the h7n9 strain of avian flu.</p><p>China has instead recently indicated it will reform its own public-health system. On May 13th the authorities announced a reorganisation of the national public-health bureaucracy under a new entity, the National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control. A priority in the shake-up is to improve top-down control, so that lower-level officials have more incentive to report new public-health threats up the chain of command.</p><p>Chinese authorities tried to deal with a similar issue after the sars outbreak of the 2000s, in part to tackle the problem that national health officials were outranked by provincial authorities who had covered up the early spread of that coronavirus in southern China. They made the monitoring of new threats more systematic, raised their game with the who and even co-operated with America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the model for China’s own cdc—the Wuhan office of which is now being mentioned in the context of a possible laboratory origin.</p><p>There is as yet no evidence in the public domain that a laboratory leak actually took place; just evidence that the possibility is real. Mr Biden’s request suggests anything the secret world can currently add to that is pretty weak stuff. His statement says that, at present, two “elements” within the intelligence community lean towards the zoonotic explanation, one prefers the laboratory origin, and no one has high confidence in any of these assessments. Without help from China, a harder look will not necessarily change this. But it is still worth taking, even given the risk of a confrontational response which will make the enhanced transparency and co-operation talked about at the World Health Assembly unlikely to blossom any time soon. </p><p><a id="assessing-the-theory-that-covid-19-leaked-from-a-chinese-lab"></a></p><h1 id="Assessing-the-theory-that-covid-19-leaked-from-a-Chinese-lab"><a href="#Assessing-the-theory-that-covid-19-leaked-from-a-Chinese-lab" class="headerlink" title="Assessing the theory that covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab"></a>Assessing the theory that covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab</h1><p>The evidence so far is circumstantial</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It is possible that the chain of infections which spread sars-cov-2 around the world began, as most new diseases do, when an animal virus found its way unaided into humans, whether in field or farm, cave or market. It is also possible that the chain began in a Chinese government laboratory. These two possibilities have been recognised by many of those studying the covid-19 pandemic for a long time. But the fact that two things are both possible does not mean they are equally likely.</p><p>For most of 2020 scientists and the media tended to treat the likelihood of a leak from a lab as a very small one, with everyday contact—“zoonotic spillover”—overwhelmingly more probable. That has now changed. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said in March that assessment of the laboratory hypothesis had not yet been extensive enough. On May 26th President Joe Biden ordered America’s intelligence agencies, which have not as yet reached a conclusion either way on the subject, to go away and try harder.</p><p>The escape artists<br>The place most strongly tied to the emergence of sars-cov-2 is a fish and animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China’s wildlife markets and the trade which supplies them with their civets, rats, pangolins and badgers are viral melting pots brimming with opportunities for zoonotic spillover. In the 2010s a study in Vietnam showed that animals acquire coronaviruses from each other as they make the journey to restaurant or market; there is no reason to think Chinese supply chains more salubrious. In February last year China announced a ban on wildlife consumption and trade in recognition of the risks involved. It was a big step, and a costly one.</p><p>The first flutterings of lab-leak concern were prompted by simple geography. That market is just 12km away from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (wiv), a global centre for coronavirus research. The Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc), which also worked on bat coronaviruses, is closer still: a mere 500 metres. A worker or workers in one of these labs could have been infected with a coronavirus being used in research, thus providing that virus with passage to the outside world. A related idea is that the virus came directly from a bat, or another animal, either inside a lab or as part of research-associated field work. An avid collector of wild bat viruses works for the cdc.</p><p>If one of these possibilities were to prove true it would be deeply and disturbingly ironic. Ever since the outbreak of sars, a respiratory disease caused by another coronavirus, in the early 2000s, coronaviruses have been seen as having a worrying propensity for pandemics. That is what made them of particular interest to the researchers in Wuhan; their work on coronaviruses was carried out in the name of reducing the threat they posed.</p><p>Pathogens escape from institutions working on them with depressing frequency. The last known death from smallpox was the result of a laboratory leak in Britain in 1978. sars-cov-1, the virus which causes sars, escaped from labs twice as it spread round the world in 2003, once in Singapore and once in Taiwan; it leaked out of a Beijing lab on two separate occasions in 2004. In December 2019 more than 100 students and staff at two agricultural research centres in Lanzhou were struck with an outbreak of brucellosis, a bacterial disease usually caught from livestock.</p><p>Most alarmingly, the h1n1 strain of influenza which started spreading around the world in 1977 is now known to have been released from a north-east Asian lab—possibly in China, possibly in Russia. Some Western observers suspected this at the time, but they made little fuss about it, perhaps afraid that doing so would lead to China and/or Russia pulling out of international flu-surveillance efforts, or spark a backlash against virology.</p><p>Biosecurity at the wiv was known to be spotty. American diplomats who visited it in 2018 reportedly flagged issues of concern, making specific mention of coronaviruses and pandemic risk. In February 2020 the Chinese ministry of science and technology issued new rules requiring laboratories to improve their biosafety, indicating unease with the status quo.</p><p>Charles Darwin, detective<br>The idea of a laboratory leak was apparently not unthinkable to those involved. When Shi Zhengli, a coronavirus researcher who is the director of the wiv’s Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases was interviewed for Scientific American in early 2020, she said one of her first concerns was whether the virus could have come from her own lab. After searching records of all the viral sequences that they had worked with, she concluded it had not. Yet the Chinese government has rarely been hesitant to suppress any information that does not suit it, and Dr Shi may not be able to say otherwise. It is also possible that the virus came from work outside her purview.</p><p>Dr Shi’s group at the wiv has spent years trying to understand mutations that would allow bat viruses to spill over into human populations. In the pursuit of such questions they conducted research designed to make coronaviruses more infectious to humans. In work published in 2015 they reported a chimera created from a bat coronavirus and a mouse coronavirus that was able to replicate efficiently in human airway cells.</p><p>Some proponents of the lab theory have speculated about what other animals the laboratory might have used in this work. They point out that the virus looks very much like a cross between a pangolin virus and a bat virus with an additional genetic sequence that makes the virus far more infectious to humans. This “furin cleavage site” is not found in other closely related viruses; perhaps it was put there, they say.</p><p>There are various counterarguments to the specifics of these speculations. There is also a more overarching caveat based on the insights of Charles Darwin: natural selection can come up with all sorts of subtleties which look like irrefutable evidence for intelligent design to those who start off believing in a designer.</p><p>What of evidence from the spread of the disease? According to the Guardian, a British newspaper, when the who sent scientist Peter Ben Embarek to China in July 2020 his subsequent report to the agency stated that the Chinese had done “little…in terms of epidemiological investigations around Wuhan since January 2020”. Some infer that China is not looking because it knows, or perhaps just fears, the answer.</p><p>That lack of zeal adds to lab-leak suspicions. One of the reasons offered for the increased interest in such ideas is that only limited further evidence for zoonotic spillover has come to light; no one has found anything close to a “smoking bat”. When the lab-leak story seems to have momentum and the zoonotic story appears to just sit there it is natural for people to get the feeling that the lab hypothesis is becoming more likely. But it is not strictly logical. It is also important to remember that the relatively quick progress made on the origin of sars in 2003 is not necessarily a reliable guide to how fast such sleuthing normally gets results.</p><p>While some data are absent, others are simply not being shared. During the who visit early this year the Chinese authorities refused requests to provide key epidemiological data on the 174 earliest known cases of covid-19 in the city in December 2019.</p><p>These data are crucial. Not all the early cases of covid-19 were from the market. Rather than being the source of the outbreak, it could simply have been a place where the virus was amplified. That speaks to the need to look at other possible sources, and that requires individualised data on every early case. The lack of such data meant that the who team was unable to do a standard epidemiological investigation, Dominic Dwyer, an Australian microbiologist, told the Wall Street Journal at the time. These early cases of covid-19 could point clearly in the direction of either an animal or laboratory source.</p><p>Excitement about the latter possibility has been stoked by the re-emergence of claims that three workers from the wiv got sick with something a bit covid-like in November 2019, claims first aired by the state department in the dying days of the Trump administration. But these reports lack corroboration, sources or details of where in the lab the people involved actually worked. That means they do nothing to move the story along.</p><p>The evidence to date shows that the circumstantial assumptions on which the idea is based—that there was coronavirus research and that it could have leaked—are true; it does not provide direct insight into the outbreak proper. As Ralph Baric, an American researcher who helped set up the wiv’s coronavirus work, told the Wall Street Journal, “more investigation and transparency are needed to define the origin”; he himself continues to see zoonotic spillover as the more likely possibility.</p><p>Ideally, China would help such investigations unearth new evidence. That can hardly be counted on. It is possible that the dogged work of America’s intelligence services may turn up compelling arguments for or against regardless, or that the many scientists poring over details of the virus’s genome and structure may come up with something. But there is no guarantee that the question will be solved soon.</p><p>Was it worth it?<br>For observers such as Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King’s College London, the uncertainty underlines the need for more discussion about the risks that the world is willing to take in the name of science. More facilities for pathogen research are being built around the world, and even the most sophisticated biosecurity measures may sometimes leak.</p><p>That means the research needs to be carried out in ways that allow scrutiny and accountability, that the knowledge sought needs to be worth the risks, and that that knowledge, once gained, should be used and made useful. There is no compelling evidence that the presence of the wiv in the city where the covid-19 pandemic began was anything other than a coincidence. But neither is there evidence that the wiv’s coronavirus research, justified in the name of pandemic preparedness, did anything to lessen this pandemic’s toll.</p><p><a id="business---alibaba-v-tencent-the-battle-for-china%E2%80%99s-e-commerce-deliveries"></a></p><h1 id="Business-—Alibaba-v-Tencent-the-battle-for-China’s-e-commerce-deliveries"><a href="#Business-—Alibaba-v-Tencent-the-battle-for-China’s-e-commerce-deliveries" class="headerlink" title="(Business)—Alibaba v Tencent: the battle for China’s e-commerce deliveries"></a>(Business)—Alibaba v Tencent: the battle for China’s e-commerce deliveries</h1><p>When it comes to logistics, Chinese tech giants take divergent routes</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 2019 richard liu told couriers working for jd.com that the Chinese e-commerce giant he founded would cancel their base pay after a 2.8bn yuan ($438m) loss the previous year, its 12th consecutive one in the red. Riders would make only a commission on deliveries. If the company did not cut back on spending, Mr Liu warned, it would go bust in two years.</p><p>Far from collapsing, two years on jd Logistics, jd.com’s delivery division, is on a roll, fuelled by a boom in Chinese e-commerce (see chart). Its parent company’s revenues jumped by 39%, year on year, in the first quarter, to 203bn yuan. On May 26th Pinduoduo, an upstart rival that also offers customers delivery by jd Logistics couriers, reported quarterly sales of 22bn yuan, 239% higher than a year ago.</p><p>The State Post Bureau expects logistics companies to deliver more than 100bn parcels this year, twice as many as in 2018. Overall spending on logistics in China is projected to hit 16trn yuan in 2021 and surpass 19trn yuan by 2025. That would make it the world’s largest market. The logistics business has also avoided the worst of the crackdown against Chinese big tech, which has seen firms such as Alibaba and Tencent (which owns a large stake in jd.com) taken to task by the Communist authorities over their growing power.</p><p>Domestic and foreign investors have been pouring money into the industry, say lawyers working on deals involving such businesses. jd Logistics has attracted investments from big private-equity groups such as Sequoia China and Hillhouse Capital. The market buzz around the firm is as frenetic as the pace at which its 190,000 workers fulfil and ferry orders. On May 21st it raised $3.2bn in Hong Kong’s second-largest initial public offering this year. Its shares are scheduled to begin trading on May 28th. The company’s backers are betting that its Amazon-like approach of creating a fully integrated delivery network has more mileage than a similar offering from sf Express, a stodgier incumbent similar to FedEx, or a rival model championed by Alibaba, which has plumped for a more distributed system.</p><p>jd Logistics is the only large Chinese delivery service to grow out of an e-commerce parent. It became a separate entity from jd.com in 2017, in part so that it could take orders from other online retailers. It still delivers the bulk of jd.com’s packages but a large chunk of its revenues now comes from orders outside the group. By owning much of its technology, lorries and warehouses, and directly employing staff, the firm has been able to ensure faster delivery times while monitoring quality. It operates China’s largest integrated logistics system, covering a good’s entire journey and including a fully autonomous fulfilment centre in Shanghai and driverless vehicles. The system can also flip into reverse, sending customer feedback to product designers that, jd Logistics claims, helps it produce better products and bolster brands.</p><p>Contrast that with Cainiao, in which Alibaba has a controlling stake. It does not own many of the logistics assets in its network. Instead it allows around 3,000 logistics companies employing some 3m couriers to plug into its platform. Its aim is to integrate and streamline the vast delivery resources that already exist across China, rather than build its own. The company has teamed up with most large logistics services—and taken investments from them as well. Alibaba, for its part, has bought minority stakes in several large operators as a means of exerting more influence over the industry. Cainiao is not publicly listed and does not disclose many operational details or, for that matter, how exactly it makes money.</p><p>In terms of revenues, both jd Logistics and Cainiao trail sf Express. Similarly to jd Logistics, that firm operates its own network. It still leads the market in “time-definite” delivery, a service that requires couriers to pick up and drop off parcels on a rapid, predetermined timetable. Like FedEx in America but unlike jd and Cainiao, it did not emerge from the tech industry, so lacks its rivals’ technological chops.</p><p>Which model emerges victorious will ultimately depend on which best controls costs, thinks Eric Lin of ubs, a bank. jd Logistics may have to lower prices further as it tries to get more business beyond jd.com. Analysts predict it could lose a combined 12bn yuan over the next three years, and turn a profit only in 2024. sf Express is spending heavily to try to match jd’s and Cainiao’s tech prowess. Its share price has fallen by around half since it issued a profit warning in April; it is expected to record a net loss of at least 900m yuan in the first quarter. Jefferies, an investment bank, points to sf Express’s troubles as a clear sign of an ongoing price war.</p><p>In the long run Cainiao’s asset-light model may enable it to keep spending in check. But for the time being it, too, is thought to be having trouble containing costs. Like its rivals it must fend off new specialist competitors offering cut-price services in areas like cold-chain and last-mile delivery. Average delivery prices in America have increased by about 5% annually in recent years, according to Bernstein, a broker. In China they have been falling at an average rate of 10% for the past decade. As China’s online shoppers get their goods ever more quickly, investors may need to brace for longer waiting times before their logistics returns finally arrive.</p><p><a id="chinese-e-commerce-titans-embark-on-a-spending-spree"></a></p><h1 id="Chinese-e-commerce-titans-embark-on-a-spending-spree"><a href="#Chinese-e-commerce-titans-embark-on-a-spending-spree" class="headerlink" title="Chinese e-commerce titans embark on a spending spree"></a>Chinese e-commerce titans embark on a spending spree</h1><p>Competition is spurring big internet companies to reinvest their plush profits</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Chinese tech giants, like those elsewhere, have thrived as covid-19 forced consumers to get their necessities and leisure online.

Rather than sit on this money (or fork it out to shareholders), it has pledged to ramp up investments in its business. It isn’t alone. As they vie for users, China’s tech titans are spending more on research and development. Even after those expenses and administrative costs, they are awash with re-investable cashflow.

But it may be pretty good advice for any manager or worker, minus the calories. The longer the shift, the less effective the employee may become.</p><p>In a new paper for Royal Society Open Finance, “Quantifying the cost of decision fatigue: suboptimal risk decisions in finance”, Tobias Baer and Simone Schnall examine the credit decisions of loan officers at a leading bank over the course of their working day. The academics write that decision fatigue “typically involves a tendency to revert to the ‘default’ option, namely whatever choice involves relatively little mental effort”. In other words, as you become tired, you get mentally lazy.</p><p>The study looked at proposals to restructure loans, with each credit officer analysing 46 requests per day. The approval rate was around 40%, so the default decision was rejection. Officers tended to start work between 8am and 10am, took lunch between 1pm and 3pm, and tended to leave at 6pm.</p><p>The researchers found that the approval rate declined significantly between 11am and 2pm, as lunch approached, then picked up again after 3pm before declining in the last two hours of work. The applications were distributed to credit officers by the bank’s automated system, so they were in effect allocated randomly. There is no sign that the loans assessed at lunchtime were of a different quality from those in the rest of the day.</p><p>What makes this study ingenious is that the authors were able to see whether or not the loans were subsequently paid back. They found that rejecting a restructuring request made it less likely that the loan would be repaid. So they calculated that decision fatigue, by causing more rejections, actually cost the bank money; around $500,000 over the course of a single month.</p><p>Similar patterns have been seen in other situations. A much-cited study of Israeli judges found they were less likely to grant parole as lunch approached, but became more lenient once their stomachs were full again. Other research found that doctors grew steadily more likely to prescribe antibiotics, even when these might not be necessary, over the course of their shift. In some areas of work, breaks are seen as a vital matter of safety. In the eu, lorry drivers are expected to take a 45-minute break after 4 hours 30 minutes behind the wheel.</p><p>Mental activity can result in physical exhaustion, as anyone who has spent a day in successive meetings can attest. In the middle of a business trip, nothing can seem more enticing than the solitary silence of a hotel room, with no clients to amuse or placate in sight. Breaks can also boost creativity. It is easy for the brain to develop tunnel vision when it is working hard. There are times when the mind needs to roam free. Kevin Cashman of Korn Ferry, a consultancy, and author of a book, “The Pause Principle”, reports that executives say their best ideas often come when exercising, taking a shower or commuting.</p><p>Taking a break by leaving the workplace, if only to go to the coffee shop, may be the sole practical way for workers to recharge mental batteries. Many people have hobbies—puzzles, crosswords, knitting—that are enjoyable because they engage only part of their conscious minds but still stave off boredom.</p><p>However, such pastimes are regarded as impermissible at the office. This is ironic since they are unlikely to disturb anyone else, whereas chatting with a colleague, which is all too likely to do so, is seen as a perfectly acceptable diversion. One of the nicest elements of working from home during the pandemic has been the ability to take breaks at the time, and in the style, of the employee’s choosing (subject to the tyranny of the Zoom conferencing calendar).</p><p>The lesson for managers is that what seems like “slacking” is actually a useful device for maintaining productivity. And the study of credit officers indicates that companies should look for ways to protect workers against decision fatigue.</p><p>One approach would be to give employees more breaks, of course. But another might be to monitor decisions at certain times of the day. The bank that was the subject of the study could have ensured that loan decisions made just before lunch, or at the end of the day, were subject to review. Software could be used to “nudge” employees with a message like: “Your decision-making seems to have changed, maybe you want to take a break and reconsider.” A pause should win applause.</p><p><a id="how-to-make-sense-of-corporate-cock-ups"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-make-sense-of-corporate-cock-ups"><a href="#How-to-make-sense-of-corporate-cock-ups" class="headerlink" title="How to make sense of corporate cock-ups"></a>How to make sense of corporate cock-ups</h1><p>Not all U-turns are as bad as AT&amp;T’s</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“Sorry” is not a word you hear often in business. Japanese miscreants may bow in shame. But in the West even architects of some of the world’s most spectacular strategic blunders struggle to express remorse. It took Gerald Levin, boss of Time Warner, a decade to apologise for what he finally admitted was “the worst deal of the century”—the $165bn merger of the media giant with aol, an internet firm, in 2001, during the dotcom crash. It was unravelled, ignominiously, eight years later.</p><p>Who knows when—or indeed if—Randall Stephenson and his former lieutenant, John Stankey, will acknowledge how wrong they were to mastermind the $110bn acquisition of Time Warner by at&amp; t, which they completed in 2018. The combination created a company weighed down by huge debts, a high dividend and onerous investment demands. A mere three years later it, too, is being dismantled, with the media business spun out and merged with Discovery, another media firm. Mr Stankey, who took over from Mr Stephenson as the telecoms giant’s boss last year, has bowed not in shame, but to the inevitable. It was u-turn or bust.</p><p>What to make of such strategic reversals? It is usual to see them all as an indictment of megalomaniacal empire-builders and money-grubbing bankers, at the expense of staff and long-suffering shareholders. And yet business, by its nature, is full of deathtraps. Risks must be taken. Wrong turns happen. Course corrections are inevitable. Not all about-turns merit the equivalent of hara-kiri in the c-suite . Here is a rough guide to when they should and should not be tolerated.</p><p>Start with experimentation, the essence of business in a world of constant flux. Most mergers and acquisitions are small, incremental bets. The payoffs can be large. When they go wrong, they cost shareholders money and generate bad headlines, but are forgivable if placed in a spirit of trial and error. Take Verizon, at&amp; t’s telecoms rival. The firm, now valued at $235bn, spent less than $10bn on aol and Yahoo, its fellow internet pioneer, in the mid-2010s, hardly breaking the bank as it sought to build a media arm. Their sale, for $5bn plus 10% of shares in May, though embarrassing, marked a retreat, not a rout—certainly compared with the tens of billions of shareholder value that analysts believe at&amp; t torched on its media binge. Call it misadventure, not madness.</p><p>Then there is speculation. Some firms make a living by buying and selling other companies, often using flimsy rationales to justify the purchases. u-turns are an occupational hazard. Headlining this group is SoftBank, a Japanese tech conglomerate, whose twists and turns can cause motion sickness. It has flipped Sprint, an American mobile operator, and is in the process of doing the same with Arm, a British chip designer. Son Masayoshi, its billionaire founder, once portrayed both as strategic acquisitions. Even Warren Buffett, the no-frills chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, a bigger, less techy conglomerate, occasionally pirouettes. Last year Berkshire dumped its holdings of airlines in America as the pandemic raged, just months after increasing its stakes. Airlines have rallied since. “I don’t consider it a great moment in Berkshire’s history,” Mr Buffett conceded recently, “but we have more net worth than any company on Earth.”</p><p>Acquisitions are not the only danger zone. Sometimes a firm’s long-term strategy implodes, requiring a big rethink. ge, an industrial group, boasted that ge Capital, its financial arm, was a profit-making machine before discovering that it was also a risky liability when the subprime crisis hit. Airbus, a European aerospace company, halted production of its a380 superjumbo after realising, 12 years into the programme, that airlines did not want it. Intel, no longer the world leader in chipmaking, will rent out some of its production facilities to others, as a foundry. These fall into the category of course corrections, not full-scale flip-flops.</p><p>The screeching handbrake turn is in a different league. at&amp; t is not the only stodgy firm to have tried—and spectacularly failed—to reinvent itself overnight. Under its flamboyant boss J6M (Jean-Marie Messier Moi Même, Maître du Monde), Vivendi, born out of a French water-and-sewage company, sought 20 years ago to re fashion itself as a global entertainment giant, becoming one of France’s biggest corporate casualties in the process. European lenders, as well as Japan’s Nomura, an investment bank, have lost fortunes trying to become racier by buying Wall Street firms. Still, none compares to at&amp; t and Time Warner for the number of u-turns running through their combined corporate history.</p><p>It is worth watching out for three danger signs. First, be alert when deals are billed as transformative. Looking through the fine print of at&amp;t’s purchase of Time Warner, the main justification, to track customers to sell advertising, was flimsy; it did not warrant the cost. Yet shareholders blithely gave it their blessing. Second, it was no small experiment: the whole company was put on the line. Third, it produced big opportunity costs. The acquisition of Time Warner and Directv, a satellite-tv company, in 2015, turned at&amp;t into America’s biggest non-financial corporate borrower. That constrained it when it needed to spend on 5g mobile spectrum and the Hollywood streaming wars. Even with the Discovery deal and its first dividend cut in decades, it is not out of the woods.</p><p>U-turn, you pay the price<br>The moral of the story is that when deals go wrong, the faster they are unravelled the better. But when they are so big that they jeopardise the future of the firm, accountability is vital, too. Mr Stephenson pocketed $90m from at&amp; t between 2018, when the Time Warner deal was completed, and the end of 2020, when he left the post of executive chairman. Mr Stankey has earned $60m. Mr Stephenson is gone. Mr Stankey should go, too, if nothing else than to serve as a deterrent against future acts of m&amp; a madness. There may be no apologies in business. But failure on such a grand scale should at least carry a price tag. </p>]]></content>

Though the civilian leadership had been supplanted by men in fatigues, the coup, he suggested, would be good for the economy.</p><p>It was not an absurd claim: the previous military-backed government, in power from 2011 to 2016, was considered more solicitous and efficient by many businessmen than the democratically elected one that followed it. And although previous stints of military rule had seen America and other Western countries impose sanctions, many Asian investors had ignored them and piled into what had seemed a promising market. Some 90% of the total stock of foreign investment in Myanmar comes from other Asian countries. If businesses around the region could be persuaded to keep funnelling money to the country, the general’s boosterism could conceivably prove correct. But the initial evidence suggests they are not quite as gung-ho as they used to be.</p><p>In response to the coup, several firms are cutting ties with two big conglomerates owned by the army. Lim Kaling, a prominent Singaporean businessman, has said he will sell his stake in a tobacco joint venture with one of the conglomerates, Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (mehl). Kirin, a Japanese brewer, has said that if it cannot find a partner to buy mehl’s stake in its joint venture in Myanmar, it will have to consider leaving the country. The Asian Development Bank has suspended new grants and loans while Japan, Myanmar’s biggest donor in 2019, has put new aid projects on hold.</p><p>Many other Asian firms are packing their bags, although relatively few tie their move explicitly to the coup. Some 11% of the more than 180 Japanese firms surveyed in April by a group of foreign chambers of commerce said they had terminated their operations in Myanmar. The country has become an extremely difficult place to do business. Internet shutdowns, staff shortages and random violence meted out by the security forces have forced many workplaces to close. More than two-thirds of the firms surveyed said they had curtailed their activities; income had declined for nearly half.</p><p>Many of these companies are staying put, nonetheless. In fact, the junta insists that Myanmar will attract $5.8bn in foreign investment this year. That may be fanciful, but several of the countries that are the biggest sources of investment are not themselves democracies, including China, Thailand and Vietnam. Companies from these places would not necessarily be put off by the coup alone.</p><p>Some firms draw a distinction between doing business with the government and with the Tatmadaw, as the armed forces are known, even though the two are now one and the same. The Korea Land and Housing Corporation is a South Korean government agency that formed a joint venture with the construction ministry in 2019 to build a new industrial park near Yangon, the commercial capital. Kwak Hwan-gun, who runs the agency’s operations in Myanmar, rejects the idea that, owing to the coup, the state’s share of any profits will flow to the army. “I don’t know where you heard that the military benefits from this but it’s totally fake news,” he insists. By the same token, Kang Ho-bin of Sun&amp;l, a South Korean firm that has a transport business with rt, a state-owned firm, insists that some government departments have managed to evade the generals’ clutches.</p><p>Some businesses take their cue from their home government. For decades the Japanese authorities have argued that economic and diplomatic engagement can nudge the generals in the right direction. State agencies and investment firms have forked out billions of dollars of grants and loans to support Japanese businesses venturing into Myanmar. Some Japanese diplomats admit that the coup shows that the government needs to think again. Yet Japan frets that if it abandons its projects, China will swoop in, says Kitaoka Shinichi, the president of Japan International Cooperation Agency, the state aid agency.</p><p>Debate about how exactly businesses should respond rages in South Korea too. Some firms argue that withdrawing altogether would hurt ordinary Burmese. Posco International, an affiliate of Posco, a South Korean steelmaker, has operated an offshore gasfield in Burmese waters in a consortium with Myanmar’s state oil and gas company since 2013. The National Unity Government ( nug), a government-in-exile composed of mps unseated by the coup, has asked Posco International and other foreign energy firms to suspend payments to the government until democracy is restored. Oil and gas is the single biggest source of revenue to the state. But Posco International argues that halting production would turn off the lights for many ordinary Burmese. Two-fifths of the country’s power came from gas in 2019—although just 20% of the gas from Posco’s business is for domestic consumption.</p><p>There are no easy answers. The nug suggests that gas companies should press on with production but should forward any money owed to the government to an escrow account, to be handed over when democracy is restored. Total, a French energy company, has said that would put their local employees at risk of prosecution and reprisals from the security forces. But on May 26th Total and Chevron, an American energy company, said they were suspending dividend payments to a Burmese pipeline company in which the state oil and gas group has a 15% stake. (They are still paying taxes for extracting gas.) Some lawmakers in America, meanwhile, want to take such decisions out of energy companies’ hands by making it difficult for them to do business in Myanmar, wherever they are from. Far from creating an economic boom, the coup could result in an implosion. </p><p><a id="myanmar%E2%80%99s-generals-struggle-to-restart-its-stalled-economy"></a></p><h1 id="Myanmar’s-generals-struggle-to-restart-its-stalled-economy"><a href="#Myanmar’s-generals-struggle-to-restart-its-stalled-economy" class="headerlink" title="Myanmar’s generals struggle to restart its stalled economy"></a>Myanmar’s generals struggle to restart its stalled economy</h1><p>Businesses are caught between striking workers and the army</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In mid-january Thaung Tun, who was then Myanmar’s minister of investment, promised local and foreign business folk a swift recovery from damage wrought by covid-19. Plans for whizzier internet and renewable energy, he said, would bring opportunities they could once “only have dreamed of”. Two weeks later the army launched a coup, bundling Mr Thaung Tun and other members of Aung San Suu Kyi’s cabinet into detention. Some analysts now think the economy could shrink by as much as 20% this year.</p><p>Business-friendly technocrats of the type who once advised Thein Sein, the retired general who served as president until 2016, hold little clout in the new regime. The army has shut companies it believes are harbouring opponents, including many media firms, while also trying to force businesses it deems essential to stay open. The army is frightened by rolling strikes that have been organised in protest against the coup and the hundreds of killings its soldiers have carried out while putting down demonstrations. In March authorities in Yangon, the commercial capital, briefly detained branch managers from supermarkets across the city so they could remind them to stay on the job.</p><p>Four months after the takeover long queues continue to form at cash machines, which frequently run out of banknotes. People wait past dusk to get money, even though being out after dark increases the risk of running into trouble with soldiers patrolling the streets. In May an official from the central bank said that frightened citizens trying to withdraw their savings were in fact aiming to “disturb the country and create mistrust”. The junta has asked banks to send it cd-roms containing records of all deposits and withdrawals.</p><p>The army had earlier threatened to fine or nationalise banks that did not get striking employees back to their posts. Quite a few have now returned. But the persistent threat of violence from security forces means many workers are frightened to be out and about for long. A Burmese employee of a South Korean bank was killed in Yangon on March 31st after soldiers fired on a company van that was taking her home after her shift.</p><p>Internet restrictions are making online commerce difficult. The junta started blocking all mobile internet in mid-March, in an effort to stymie demonstrations. In recent weeks it has started allowing access to selected online services, though social-media sites remain off limits. Investors were once keen on Myanmar’s digital economy, which grew particularly swiftly during lockdowns imposed to control the spread of covid-19. They had previously piled money into local firms such as Frontiir, an internet service provider. Not any more. Telenor, a Norwegian mobile operator that began rolling out its service in Myanmar almost a decade ago, has written off the full value of its business in the country, at a cost of $782m.</p><p>Restaurants and shops in the posher bits of Yangon have reopened, but customers remain sparse. A fruit-merchant in the city’s Chinatown says that although it is getting much easier than it was to transport produce around the country, “there are far fewer buyers than before”. A foreigner who runs a consumer-goods business in the city says he has yet to restart operations since deciding to down tools in February, in part because of worries about the safety of staff. “We are waiting to see what happens in the coming months, but it is hard to be optimistic.”</p><p>Activists would like more businesses to take a stand against the regime. On May 12th Tom Andrews, the un’s rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said companies “should exert the maximum leverage on the military”. More than 200 firms, local and foreign, have backed a joint statement calling for democracy and the rule of law. But the army has a history of violence against the staff of businesses that upset it, says an executive at a big foreign company. “Even as part of what appears to be civil dialogue with authorities, in official letters and phone calls, the threats are there: ‘or else there will be consequences’.” </p><p><a id="india%E2%80%99s-covid-19-crisis-is-beginning-to-ease"></a></p><h1 id="India’s-covid-19-crisis-is-beginning-to-ease"><a href="#India’s-covid-19-crisis-is-beginning-to-ease" class="headerlink" title="India’s covid-19 crisis is beginning to ease"></a>India’s covid-19 crisis is beginning to ease</h1><p>But its vaccination programme is stumbling</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In late may India passed two sad milestones in the struggle against covid-19. The official number of deaths from the pandemic crossed 300,000. Daily fatalities topped a record 4,500. Sadder still was the certainty that on both counts the true toll was many multiples higher. Across vast stretches of the country’s interior there is little testing for the virus, and therefore few “official” cases or deaths. Epidemiologists agree that a full tally would put India far ahead of America and Brazil in the dismal rivalry for the country with the most people killed by covid-19.</p><p>Yet even India’s faulty government numbers now give reason for hope. The parts of the country where counting is fairly reliable show a clear trend. The virus’s vicious second wave is rolling back almost as fast as it rolled in. In early May India was recording some 400,000 new cases a day. This has now fallen below 250,000. The daily number of new cases in Mumbai, the country’s commercial capital and one of the first places to see a surge, is about an eighth of its peak. In Delhi, the hard-hit capital, the share of covid-19 tests proving positive in April reached a frightening 36%. This has tumbled below 2%. The corresponding national “positivity rate”, heavily weighted towards cities where more tests are performed, has fallen from 24% to less than 10%.</p><p>In the main cities at least, the desperate fight to get oxygen to gasping patients has been won. Daily demand for liquid medical oxygen (lmo), which reached some 9,000 tonnes—three times the demand during India’s first peak in September—has now begun to drop, according to a government task-force.</p><p>Jokers point to another indicator of improving fortunes. Leaders whose visibility faded as the tragedy mounted have suddenly grown less camera-shy. “You know cases are going down because…Modi has reappeared,” jested one tweet, referring to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who recently appeared to choke with emotion during a televised Zoom call with doctors in his parliamentary constituency.</p><p>But if panic is beginning to recede, the crisis is far from over. The wave started in the west of the country, broadly speaking, and has still not finished sweeping eastwards. Infections in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in the far south, are only just beginning to peak. “We can’t really be sanguine because it’s like an agglomeration of peaks,” says Ambarish Satwik, a surgeon in one of Delhi’s biggest hospitals. “It’s going to move centrifugally from cities to villages, so it’ll drive on for a bit.”</p><p>Across India’s poor, crowded Gangetic plain, where doctors and statistics are most sparse, anecdotal evidence suggests that the grim reaper has come, snatched lives in every village and mostly then marched on again. It has left whole communities emotionally and economically shattered. A team of reporters from Dainik Bhaskar, a Hindi-language daily, counted more than 2,000 corpses hastily disposed of along a 1,100km stretch of the Ganges.</p><p>The victims are not only the very poor. A teachers’ union in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, says no fewer than 1,621 out of the 800,000 teachers who work in its public schools died in the past month. At a recent conclave of state-owned banks, which employ more than half a million people, managers said that around one in five staff had contracted covid, and that more had died of the illness in the past six weeks than in the preceding year of the pandemic.</p><p>The wave has left scars. While India’s poorest, perennially battered by droughts, floods and capricious governments, among other plagues, have been forced to bear the calamity with stoicism, its middle class has been made to feel vulnerable as never before. Even the most privileged found themselves locked out of overwhelmed hospitals, or obliged to queue for vaccines along with hoi polloi. Their suffering continues. On social media, urban Indians are no longer messaging desperate pleas for oxygen, or for drugs that were widely and wrongly prescribed for covid-19. Now the demand is for medicine to fight mucormycosis or “black fungus”, a deadly infection that has particularly afflicted diabetics who were too liberally dosed with steroids during treatment.</p><p>Public frustration over the scale of the tragedy might have been soothed if the government’s vaunted campaign to vaccinate Indians had been a success. Instead it has failed spectacularly. During the height of the surge in infections the number of people receiving shots did not rise to meet the threat, but instead withered from 3.5m a day to barely 1.5m because the government had failed to plan properly or to secure enough vaccine. Millions of Indians who received a first dose now wonder when or whether they will receive a second. Many millions more—some 89% of India’s 1.4bn people—have received no dose at all. Their wait may be long: the imf predicts that by the end of this year fewer than 35% of adults will have received a jab.</p><p>The government, belying its own talk of determination to secure more vaccines, still will not license proven foreign ones such as those of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Bureaucrats refuse to waive indemnity clauses, as dozens of other countries have done, leaving the companies to face the risk of endless, costly litigation in India’s overburdened courts.</p><p>In cities, where more people are able to get a jab, the vaccination campaign may have helped bend the current wave. But the main cause of the decline in numbers, aside from the virus’s own natural trajectory, has been the imposition of tough local lockdowns. Mr Modi’s government, wary of hurting India’s badly wounded economy even more, had delayed these measures as long as possible. But in the end it was strict curfews, enforced by public fear of the rampaging disease as much as police muscle, that have saved most lives.</p><p><a id="the-philippines-is-repairing-its-relationship-with-america"></a></p><h1 id="The-Philippines-is-repairing-its-relationship-with-America"><a href="#The-Philippines-is-repairing-its-relationship-with-America" class="headerlink" title="The Philippines is repairing its relationship with America"></a>The Philippines is repairing its relationship with America</h1><p>Tilting towards China has not done it much good</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The discovery in March of 200-odd Chinese vessels around a reef in the “exclusive economic zone” that extends 200 nautical miles from the Philippines’ shores has brought near-daily protests from its foreign and defence ministries. Whitsun Reef, which the government calls the Julian Felipe Reef, is one of many that make up the Spratly Islands in the middle of the South China Sea. It is three times closer to the Philippines than to China, which lays wild and unsupported claim to nearly the whole sea.</p><p>The swarming of Whitsun, led by “grey zone” militia vessels masquerading as fishing trawlers, is the latest move in China’s expanding occupation of contested specks in the South China Sea. This time, most of the Philippine government appears determined not simply to roll over. As the defence secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, put it: “While we acknow ledge that China’s military capability is more advanced than ours, this does not deter us from defending our national interest, and our dignity as a people, with all that we have.” The foreign secretary, Teodoro “Teddy Boy” Locsin, who has a notorious trigger thumb on Twitter, went further. “China, my friend,” he wrote, “how politely can I put it? Let me see… O…GET THE FUCK OUT.”</p><p>Strikingly, the member of government most reluctant to criticise China is the president, Rodrigo Duterte. After Mr Locsin’s outburst, the coarse-talking Mr Duterte declared that, within his cabinet, only he had a licence to curse. He also found ways to praise China, including for the supply of much-needed vaccines against covid-19.</p><p>On paper, says Julius Trajano, a political analyst, the president is the chief architect of foreign policy in the Philippines. After he took office in 2016, Mr Duterte tilted strongly towards the great power to the north. He refused to press a ruling in the Philippines’ favour from an international tribunal, which rubbished China’s sweeping claims in the South China Sea. On his first trip to Beijing as president to meet his counterpart, Xi Jinping, he declared that it was “time to say goodbye” to the United States. For good measure he announced a military “separation” from the Philippines’ ally and former colonial power.</p><p>At the time, Mr Duterte was quick to boast of the fruits of his pro-China tilt: promises of big investments in the Philippines’ decrepit infrastructure as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (bri); the return of Filipino fishermen to the waters around Scarborough Shoal, into which China had muscled in 2012; and the prospect of Chinese help in exploring for hydrocarbons in Philippine waters. Yet, says Jay Batongbacal of the University of the Philippines, it has nearly all come to naught. bri projects are either small (a couple of bridges in Manila, the capital) or controversial (dams in nature reserves). Fishermen say they are frightened to return to Scarborough Shoal, given past rammings by Chinese vessels. Maritime tensions preventing exploration for oil and gas, Mr Batongbacal argues, have influenced energy policy, leading to an overemphasis on coal. A flood of Chinese nationals to Manila’s offshore gambling industry has brought a host of social problems in its wake.</p><p>Mr Duterte’s insistence that relations remain good is motivated by hopes of deliveries of Chinese vaccines, on which his legacy now rests (he steps down next year). To date, supplies have been paltry. And despite the pandemic’s ravages—more than 20,000 dead—Filipinos are sceptical of Chinese jabs.</p><p>The president must realise that his tilt towards China has been a failure. The reverse of the coin is a renewed tilt towards America. A year ago Mr Duterte announced the cancellation of the bilateral Visiting Forces Agreement (vfa), which enables American troops to be deployed in the Philippines. Yet twice since then he has granted an extension allowing the vfa to continue, while Mr Lorenzana and Mr Locsin argue for its permanent retention. Meanwhile, Mr Duterte has at last begun to champion the arbitral ruling against China’s claims, including to Scarborough Shoal.</p><p>The Philippines is repairing its relationship with America. In reality, it was never sundered—foreign and security ties run deep. Still, the administration of President Joe Biden has signalled support. It has increased joint military exercises and has made clear that its mutual-defence treaty covers coming to the Philippines’ aid, even in the event of an attack by China’s unofficial militias. China may have won Whitsun Reef. But it has lost the Philippines.</p><p><a id="china---education-in-china-is-becoming-increasingly-unfair-to-the-poor"></a></p><h1 id="China-—Education-in-China-is-becoming-increasingly-unfair-to-the-poor"><a href="#China-—Education-in-China-is-becoming-increasingly-unfair-to-the-poor" class="headerlink" title="(China)—Education in China is becoming increasingly unfair to the poor"></a>(China)—Education in China is becoming increasingly unfair to the poor</h1><p>The hukou system of household registration exacerbates a huge divide</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>After xiong xuan’ang gained the capital’s best score in China’s university-entrance exam in 2017, he was interviewed by Beijing’s media. The son of diplomats, Mr Xiong acknowledged that his upbringing had been privileged. “All the top scorers now come from wealthy families,” he said. “It is becoming very difficult for students from rural areas to get into good universities.” His honesty drew much praise online.</p><p>Since 1998, when China began a huge expansion of university enrolment, the number of students admitted annually has quadrupled to nearly 10m. About one third of high-school students now proceed to undergraduate courses. Data are patchy, but experts agree that the share of rural students at China’s best universities (the top 1%) has shrunk. Only 0.3% of rural students make it into them, compared with 2.8% of urban ones. Most other tertiary institutions are far inferior.</p><p>Around the world, students from poor backgrounds struggle to compete with their richer counterparts. In China the divide is particularly stark. The main cause is the hukou system, which makes it very difficult to gain free access to state-provided services outside the place where one’s household is registered. This means that in cities, the children of migrants from the countryside are usually shut out of local state schools. They have to attend shoddy private ones that charge fees, or go to their parents’ village for an education that is free but also bare-bones.</p><p>The situation is made worse by the way that university places are allocated. The best universities are concentrated in the biggest and richest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. They offer a disproportionate number of places to students with local hukou. China’s two most prestigious universities, Peking University and Tsinghua, are in Beijing. Their acceptance rate is around 1% for local students but only a tenth of that for applicants from places outside the capital, according to state television. More students from Beijing are admitted to Tsinghua every year than the combined number of successful applicants from Guangdong and Shandong. The population of those two provinces is ten times bigger than Beijing’s.</p><p>In a paper published in 2015, scholars from Tsinghua and Stanford University said students with hukou in the poorest fifth of counties were seven times less likely than their urban counterparts to get a university place and 14 times less likely to attend an elite one. In those counties, the odds were even more stacked against girls and ethnic minorities. “It is really, really clear that it is now much, much harder for a poor, rural kid to get into a good university,” says Scott Rozelle of Stanford. He estimates that around 75% of urban children go to university compared with 15% of rural ones. Nearly 80% of children under 14 have rural hukou. But writing in 2017, Wu Xiaogang, now of nyu Shanghai, a Sino-American joint-venture university, said less than 17% of students in elite universities had rural household-registration before taking up their places. The pattern has not changed since then, says Mr Wu. “If anything, it may be even worse now.”</p><p>That is because inequalities in society are becoming more pronounced. The children of wealthy families have access to the best schools as well as to after-school tutoring and extra-curricular activities. Their parents can afford homes in good catchment areas. China offers nine years of free, compulsory education, but fees are levied at state-run senior secondary schools. In poor areas, charges can amount to more than 80% of net income per person, one of the highest such burdens in the world. Some students prefer to start work: a typical unskilled factory hand can earn in a month what a poor farmer earns in a year.</p><p>The national university-entrance exam was suspended for the final decade of Mao Zedong’s rule. Since its relaunch in 1977, universities mostly have relied on test scores for admission. In 2003 China began to allow some universities to recruit students with special talents such as in sports and arts. Again, the wealthy have been the main beneficiaries: only they can afford to pay for the training needed.</p><p>For decades state-funded feeder schools in poorer areas played a vital role in offering good students from the countryside a chance to get into university. But many have closed as a result of migration into cities. Meanwhile, competition has grown for places in good senior secondary schools. Ma Hang attended primary school in his home village. But the best junior high school in the county would not accept village students unless they paid extra fees or had powerful connections. His parents managed to use such a connection to get him into the school. He says that set him on a path that led him to a feeder high school and then to university.</p><p>Rural children in China face obstacles at every stage of development. Babies are more likely to be undernourished and lack parental attention. By the time they enter primary school, many have ailments such as anaemia, poor vision and worms. Around 60% of students from the poorest counties suffer from at least one of these afflictions, says Mr Rozelle.</p><p>Those who, despite the odds, make it to elite universities often feel socially isolated. In 2020 a student from the countryside took to social media to describe being “lost and confused” at university after leaving the “straightforward environment” of school, where passing tests was the focus. More than 100,000 students, many with rural backgrounds, weighed in, sharing their own experiences of feeling like misfits and lamenting their job prospects. They coined a new term in Chinese: xiao zhen zuotijia, meaning “small-town swot”.</p><p>Wang Jianyue, a country-born physics whizz, can relate to their complaints. He chose to study finance at university, thinking it would be easier to find a job with such a specialism. It was only after he saw several of his classmates get internships at big financial firms using their parents’ connections that he “truly understood the gap” between himself and them. Mr Wang changed his focus to computer science. Unlike some other small-town swots, he has, to his relief, got a job offer.</p><p><a id="china-wants-to-curb-an-old-custom-the-hazing-of-wedding-couples"></a></p><h1 id="China-wants-to-curb-an-old-custom-the-hazing-of-wedding-couples"><a href="#China-wants-to-curb-an-old-custom-the-hazing-of-wedding-couples" class="headerlink" title="China wants to curb an old custom: the hazing of wedding couples"></a>China wants to curb an old custom: the hazing of wedding couples</h1><p>It does not fit with the government’s plan to create “civilised cities”</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Nerves are common in the run-up to nuptials. Couples in some parts of China must brace for torment. In a ritual called naohun, or “disturbing the wedding”, guests haze them. Often this involves forcing the man to strip to his underwear and don stockings or a bra. Friends then tie him to something and slather his body with sticky substances such as soy sauce and eggs. Firecrackers, taped to flesh, are sometimes set off; injuries ensue. Women can be targeted, too. Naohun allows people to kiss the bride and bridesmaids and even to grope them.</p><p>Naohun rites were not always intended to humiliate. They began centuries ago with the aim of helping to put newlyweds—who often barely knew each other—at ease. Relatives would gently tease the couple in their bridal chamber, alluding to intimate acts. This served as a form of sex education. Rituals involving the groom’s father, such as making him carry his daughter-in-law on his back, were once cheered as a sign that she would be well-treated by her husband’s family.</p><p>But in recent times, naohun has become an excuse to be rowdy, lewd or even physically abusive. In 2017 NetEase, an internet giant, found 142 cases in the previous five years of hazing so outrageous that it had featured in stories in China’s media. Half of the incidents involved binding and beating. In 80% of them, grooms were the victims. Only five involved hazing of the bride, but cases of sexual harassment may often go unreported.</p><p>The custom has faded in big cities but remains popular elsewhere. In the NetEase sample, the provinces of Shandong and Yunnan accounted for 60% of cases. The practice upsets the government, which wants to create “civilised cities”. Last year it called for an end to “unhealthy marriage practices”. These included naohun, “extravagance and waste” at parties and “sky-high” caili—cash given by the groom to the bride’s family. In April the central authorities designated 15 areas in ten provinces as pilot zones for wedding reform.</p><p>Local governments have responded with a flurry of directives. In Inner Mongolia, in the north, weddings must now be hosted by local “red-and-white councils” run by Communist Party branches (red stands for weddings, white for funerals). In some provinces, newlyweds must sign a pledge to eschew “uncivilised” naohun. A county in Henan province has capped caili at 30,000 yuan ($4,600)—less than a third of the going rate. Others have limited the size of banquets to 30 tables. Fines have been specified for rule-breakers.</p><p>Even before the central government began its campaign, the city of Dali, a popular wedding spot in Yunnan, had begun stationing urban-management officers at well-known naohun locations. Yang Pinkang, a 26-year-old local who got married in October, had no naohun. “My friends were disappointed,” Mr Yang says. “But am I not meant to look my best for my wife on my wedding day?” He says residents have gone cool on naohun since the drowning of a groom who was thrown into a lake. Mr Yang recalls how his uncle set his aunt’s wedding dress on fire after friends dared him to crawl under it and light matches.</p><p>No more such recklessness in Shandong province, officials hope. “Let us all be more polite,” one city there, Zouping, decreed in March. “Help weddings go back to being warm and romantic.” Consider it a marriage demand, not a proposal. </p><p><a id="china%E2%80%99s-revealing-afghan-strategy"></a></p><h1 id="China’s-revealing-Afghan-strategy"><a href="#China’s-revealing-Afghan-strategy" class="headerlink" title="China’s revealing Afghan strategy"></a>China’s revealing Afghan strategy</h1><p>A suspicious China prepares for America to pull out of Afghanistan</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On may 9th China’s foreign ministry was asked to comment on an atrocity in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Terrorists had detonated a car bomb outside a girls’ school, then two more bombs to kill pupils running for safety. At least 68 people had died, most of them children. The attack was aimed at girls from a Shia minority that is often targeted by Sunni Islamist groups, which have brought much misery to Afghanistan. Today such groups are jostling for blood-soaked advantage ahead of a full withdrawal of American forces, at the latest by September 11th this year, as ordered by President Joe Biden. China’s diplomats could have responded to the latest violence in several plausible ways.</p><p>It would have been reasonable for the foreign ministry to tell the largest militant group, the Taliban, to rein in the mayhem, for China enjoys growing leverage over the Taliban’s leaders. That may seem counterintuitive. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has expressed hope that future Afghan governments will embrace moderate Islam: an apparent rebuke of Taliban-style zealotry. Across the border, in China’s north-western region of Xinjiang, officials have demolished mosques and banned young people from public prayers. In all perhaps a million Muslims, most of them from the Uyghur minority, have passed through re-education camps in Xinjiang, set up to cure them of excessively religious or “backwards” thinking, and to turn them into biddable workers, loyal to the Chinese motherland.</p><p>But the Taliban can be both fanatical and pragmatic, it turns out. Their leaders hope to rule Afghanistan soon, a quarter of a century after they first subjected the country to a reign of pious terror. Especially over the past three years, say scholars and diplomats in Beijing and other capitals, links between the Afghan Taliban and China have grown remarkably. Anxious for political recognition and economic backing from their giant neighbour, Taliban delegations have approved of Chinese plans to build motorways between Afghan cities. They claim to support a Chinese-funded project near Kabul to create one of the world’s largest copper mines, which has been stalled for years by concerns about ancient Buddhist ruins on the site and by fears of militant attacks.</p><p>Privately, it is said, the Taliban have signalled that they do not care about Xinjiang. That relates to China’s main interest in Afghanistan: to prevent that unhappy country from sliding into chaos and becoming a haven or transit corridor for Uyghur militants who, China is sure, lurk in the region. Those fighters, China believes, include some with combat experience in Syria, some trained by Iran, and others who hope to enter Xinjiang through lawless tribal regions of Pakistan.</p><p>It would have been reasonable, too, for China to have asked Pakistan to help stem the bloodshed. Pakistan is the Taliban’s patron, and has prodded the Afghan militants to establish ties with China. Pakistan likes to be useful to China, its most important sponsor. But the ministry chose a different response. After deploring the murder of the schoolgirls in Kabul, its spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, singled out America for blame. She charged that the “abrupt” announcement of America’s exit from Afghanistan had “led to a series of explosive attacks throughout the country”. She called on foreign troops “to pull out in a responsible manner and avoid inflicting more turmoil and suffering on the Afghan people”.</p><p>This is a new criticism. Chinese scholars and state media have spent years accusing American forces of straying beyond their original mission to eradicate al-Qaeda and of spreading turmoil with their naive dreams of Western-style nation-building. More recently, they have asserted that America will surely leave behind covert operatives after its troops leave, in part to make trouble for China. In short, China believes that America has stayed too long in Afghanistan, is departing too hastily and is not really leaving at all.</p><p>That line of argument is tangled enough. Making it more so, Chinese officials now call Afghanistan an area of possible co-operation with America, along with climate change and efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. When pressed for detail, including at a recent meeting with American counterparts in Anchorage, Chinese envoys are vague. A few years ago China and America did jointly train Afghan diplomats and police. These days China stresses the importance of its Belt and Road Initiative: how the infrastructure-building scheme can promote Afghan development and thus stability, such as by connecting the country to the sea via Pakistan.</p><p>Afghanistan once saw remarkable co-operation. Early in the war on terror, President George W. Bush’s administration designated a Uyghur group, the East Turkistan Independence Movement ( etim), as terrorists. Chinese agents were allowed to interrogate Uyghurs detained in Guantánamo Bay. They told one Uyghur he was lucky to be in American hands, since “as soon as they got him back to China, he was dead”, his lawyer later told Congress. Such joint action is unthinkable now: the two sides are so far apart on Xinjiang. In 2020 the Trump administration delisted etim as a terror group, expressing doubts that it still existed. China says it is a grave menace.</p><p>To China, nothing matters more than stability<br>China sees its positions as coherent. Singling out America as a troublemaker is logical. It also distrusts the Taliban, Pakistan and Iran, but those actors have reasons to bow to China’s will, so do not need public scolding. In contrast, America is a dangerous rival that has made bad mistakes, so is an ideal target for criticism. China may support regional or un peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, if its neighbour seems on the brink of civil war. But it will not send its own troops to keep order, at least under a Chinese flag, because its neighbour is a “graveyard of empires”. Afghanistan’s case is revealing. China is emerging as a great power that—to an exceptional degree—trusts in cold, hard economic and security interests alone. To China, self-interest is wisdom. </p><p><a id="middle-east--africa---how-the-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-is-failing"></a></p><h1 id="Middle-East-amp-Africa-—How-the-Israeli-Palestinian-peace-process-is-failing"><a href="#Middle-East-amp-Africa-—How-the-Israeli-Palestinian-peace-process-is-failing" class="headerlink" title="(Middle East &amp; Africa)—How the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is failing"></a>(Middle East &amp; Africa)—How the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is failing</h1><p>The Holy Land looks ever more like one unequal state</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>By the standards of the peace process, if not international law, Oranit is not a terribly contentious Jewish settlement. The Palestinians previously accepted that this hilly town of low-slung homes in the occupied West Bank would remain part of Israel in a future two-state solution. In one negotiating session their disagreements amounted to an area of about 400 square metres. It has grown into a commuter town, half an hour by motorway from Tel Aviv, and rates nine out of ten on Israel’s “socioeconomic index”, a measure of education, wealth and employment.</p><p>Look east across the sun-baked hills and one sees Azzun Atmeh, an impoverished Palestinian village. No easy commutes for its residents: it is almost fully encircled by settlements and the imposing separation barrier. This is theoretically part of a future Palestine, but right now it is Israel, with most of its land designated as “Area C”, where Israel holds civil and military jurisdiction.</p><p>The question of how to divide this land has been more or less answered, yet the parcelling out to two states has not come. Instead it remains under Israel’s control—a single state in which Jewish Israelis and West Bank Palestinians living a stone’s throw from each other hold very different rights and face very different prospects.</p><p>Almost three decades have passed since Yasser Arafat, the late Palestinian leader, and Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s prime minister at the time, shook hands on the White House lawn in 1993 after signing the Oslo accords. That hopeful moment cemented a formal peace process that would create a Palestinian state and end half a century of conflict. It was meant to happen within five years. Hope, alas, gave way to despair. It has now been more than five years since the parties even sat down to talk.</p><p>Each time there is a bout of bloodletting between Israelis and Palestinians, it is de rigueur to urge them back to the negotiating table. But such rhetoric obscures why the peace process has failed. Decades of meetings produced a mountain of maps and policy papers. The outline of a two-state solution is well known to all. The problem with the peace process is not a lack of process, it is that process became a substitute for peace.</p><p>To continue that process in hope of a breakthrough is to indulge a fantasy. It pretends that conditions on the ground—the steady growth of Israeli settlements, Israel’s ever-more entrenched control of Jerusalem, the schism between the West Bank and Gaza—are merely obstacles to negotiate around rather than insurmountable roadblocks. And it ignores shifts in politics and public opinion. Most Palestinians and a plurality of Israeli Jews oppose the two-state solution, as do two of the three governments between the river and the sea.</p><p>It is time to admit the land-for-peace paradigm has failed. Moreover, it has often been unhelpful and counterproductive. The theoretical existence of a peace process gave Israel cover to entrench an occupation that looks permanent, and contributed to the rot in Palestinian politics. What exists today, and will exist for the foreseeable future, is really just one state.</p><p>The Palestinian Authority (pa), the self-governing edifice set up after the Oslo accords, was meant to exist “for a transitional period not exceeding five years”. That deadline came and went, but the parties came close to a deal in 2000 at the Camp David summit, two weeks of sequestered talks between Ehud Barak, then the prime minister of Israel, and Mr Arafat. Conventional wisdom at the time blamed the latter for walking away; subsequent assessments offered a more muddled picture.</p><p>Regardless, the failure at Camp David gave way to the brutal second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which soured many Israelis on making peace. Still, more negotiations followed: the “road map for peace”, the summits at Taba and Annapolis and Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>For the past decade these efforts have been listless. Barack Obama’s two attempts at peacemaking lacked even memorable names. The second segued into a brutal 51-day war between Israel and Hamas, the violent Islamist group that rules Gaza. There have been no direct talks since 2014. Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” was a curious effort to solve the conflict without input from Palestinians.</p><p>His successor, Joe Biden, seems disinclined even to try. He played at best a secondary role in broking a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel when they fought earlier this month. Then he dispatched Antony Blinken, his secretary of state, for a round of talks. The focus was to be aid for Gaza. The peace process was not on the agenda.</p><p>Unsettling<br>In 1968 one of Mr Blinken’s predecessors, Dean Rusk, sent a sharp memo to the Israeli embassy in Washington. He noted reports that Israel was establishing civilian settlements in the newly occupied West Bank. This not only violated the Geneva Conventions, Mr Rusk wrote, but also “creates the strong appearance that Israel… does not intend to reach a settlement involving withdrawal from those areas”.</p><p>Today more than 440,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements, a figure that has grown roughly fourfold since the Oslo accords were signed. The world has done nothing to halt their growth. Diplomats have accepted the fiction that the settlements are temporary, a claim belied by billions of shekels invested in homes and infrastructure over decades. Some settlers have now lived in the West Bank for two generations.</p><p>Negotiators insist that big settlement “blocs”, which house about three-quarters of the settlers in the West Bank, are no obstacle to a peace deal. Yet one of the largest, Ariel, sits almost halfway across the width of the West Bank. The blocs carve ribbons and punch holes in the outline of a Palestinian state (see map). More than 100,000 Israelis live outside them, in isolated communities that would need to be evacuated—more than 12 times the number removed from Gaza during Israel’s disengagement from that territory in 2005.</p><p>Settlers wield a level of political power today they did not hold back then. Five parties in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) are ideologically committed to expanding settlements deep in the West Bank. Together they hold 56 seats, five shy of a majority. Even members of the Labour party have urged Israel to annex large chunks of the West Bank and end the fiction of “temporary” settlement. A poll conducted last year by the Israel Democracy Institute found that just 30% of Israelis opposed doing so.</p><p>Mr Trump’s peace plan was widely mocked. But the map it offered, an archipelago of Palestinian territory connected by roads and tunnels and pockmarked with Israeli enclaves, was probably a realistic vision of how a peace agreement would look. (It still did not satisfy the settler movement, for which the very existence of a Palestinian state is anathema.)</p><p>His plan did not offer even the pretence of a capital for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, which they have long sought (the area is largely Palestinian). Instead they would house their future government in dismal suburbs on the far side of Israel’s concrete separation barrier. That too reflects current trends in Israeli politics. No big party accepts the city’s division.</p><p>Jerusalem is now ringed with settlements, home to more than 200,000 Israelis, making it impossible to give the Palestinians a contiguous capital and difficult even to connect the northern and southern halves of the West Bank. Right-wing Israeli groups are using courts to try to expel Palestinians from their homes in Arab-majority neighbourhoods. The settler movement is not shy about its objectives. Each hill it claims in the West Bank, each home it seizes in East Jerusalem, makes it harder for Israel to cede the occupied territories in a final agreement with the Palestinians.</p><p>The settlers’ spoiling is working, but they need not worry, anyway: there is no Palestinian leader to strike such a deal. Mahmoud Abbas has been president since 2005, serving an endless four-year term. Two-thirds of Palestinians are unhappy with his performance; 68% want him gone.</p><p>Mr Abbas rules by decree, but he has no legitimacy to speak on behalf of Palestinians, half of whom are outside his remit anyway. The community in East Jerusalem feels adrift and leaderless, caught between the pa, which has no authority there, and the Israeli government, which most Palestinians are ineligible to vote for. The 2m in Gaza live under the rule of Hamas, which offers, at best, a lengthy truce with Israel.</p><p>Out of mind<br>In Israel, meanwhile, the peace process is no longer a salient political issue. That is largely thanks to the long-serving prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. He tepidly endorsed a two-state solution in 2009, but has spent much of his career working to prevent it. Foreign diplomats often say the occupation is unsustainable. In the short term, Mr Netanyahu has proved them wrong. The security situation is fairly calm, the economy hummed before the pandemic and Israel’s diplomatic position is better than ever. Last year it established overt ties with four Arab states.</p><p>With no pressure to resolve the conflict, most Israeli parties either oppose the two-state solution or ignore it. The Labour party, once the beating heart of Israel’s peace camp—it held a 44-seat plurality at the time of the Oslo accords—won just seven seats at the last election.</p><p>A poll of Palestinians in March found that just 40% still support the two-state solution, down from 51% in 2016 and 56% in 2011. Support among Israeli Jews dropped from 53% in 2016 to 42% last year. Five years ago 82% of Israeli Arabs backed the idea; today 59% do.</p><p>Yet Israelis and Palestinians are not sure what they do support (see chart). Some desire a single, binational state, others an apartheid state. There are Palestinians who hope to throw all the Jews into the sea and Jews who hope to throw all the Palestinians into Jordan. The most popular choice after a two-state solution is to believe there is presently no solution.</p><p>It need not be a binary choice between one state and two. Some Israelis and Palestinians talk of a confederation that would split the difference. Both communities could fulfil their national aspirations, but with shared institutions and a porous border. Both Mr Abbas and Reuven Rivlin, the outgoing Israeli president, have expressed openness to such an arrangement.</p><p>It would face obstacles, not least that it requires creating a system of governance that does not exist in the world today. A binational state would have to overcome a century of hostility. Such challenges are often cited as a reason to support the status quo: a two-state solution is desirable because the alternatives would be hard. After three decades of failed negotiations, though, this argument sounds hollow.</p><p>In his final weeks as secretary of state, in 2016, John Kerry warned that Israel was heading for a permanent occupation, a reality he described as “separate but unequal”. His choice of words, a reference to Jim Crow in America, was meant to jolt listeners. Yet it was less a prediction of the future than a description of reality. The four groups of Palestinians in the Holy Land all face formal and practical discrimination compared with Israeli Jews.</p><p>Start with Arab Israelis, as Israel calls them, or Palestinian citizens of Israel, as many (though not all) call themselves. They hold full citizenship, if not quite full rights. A “nation-state law” passed in 2018 reserved the right of “national self-determination” for Jews alone. The poverty rate for Arabs, 36%, is double that of Jews; their average monthly income in 2018 was 34% lower. The Supreme Court has upheld the right of small towns to screen residents for “social suitability”, a practice that has been used to bar Arabs from moving in.</p><p>Palestinians in East Jerusalem exist in a sort of limbo. Most refuse to seek Israeli citizenship, waiting for a solution that never comes. They risk losing their Israeli residency cards if they leave the city; more than 14,000 have been revoked since 1967.</p><p>A Palestinian born a few kilometres to the north, in Ramallah, cannot visit Jerusalem without a permit. Life in the West Bank is largely confined to the one-third of its territory under a measure of Palestinian control. Hundreds of checkpoints restrict freedom of movement.</p><p>Then there is Gaza. To be born there, since 2007, is to be born in a place one cannot easily leave. Israel permits only select categories of Palestinians to cross its border, while Egypt allows only a few thousand travellers a month (and some months none at all). Almost half of Gazans are unemployed and 80% need help from aid groups to survive.</p><p>These divisions occasionally collapse during times of trouble, as they did this May, when unrest in Jerusalem led to rocket fire from Gaza, riots inside Israel and protests in the West Bank. In quieter times, though, Palestinian leaders are happy to help perpetuate divisions among their people in order to preserve their fiefs.</p><p>Several years ago your correspondent met Mahmoud Zahar, one of the founders of Hamas, in Gaza. In the West Bank, he said, Palestinians faced the routine threat of having their homes demolished by the Israeli army, often for failing to obtain building permits that are nigh impossible to get. Not so in Gaza: “Since Hamas took power,” he said, “there has not been a single house demolition.”</p><p>That would come as a surprise to Palestinians who recently endured 11 days of conflict. The fighting displaced more than 70,000 people; some have no homes to return to. A longer war in 2014 left an estimated 17,000 families, more than 100,000 people, homeless. In fact, Mr Zahar was one of them: his home was destroyed by an Israeli air strike.</p><p>Such is the emptiness of Hamas’s rhetoric. To the extent that it remains popular, that is largely in contrast to the superannuated Mr Abbas. At 85, he is old enough to remember a time before Israel existed; most of his constituents are not old enough to remember a time before he was president. The pa he oversees was meant to form the nucleus of a future state. With no state on offer, today it serves mostly to distribute public-sector salaries and conduct security co-ordination with Israel.</p><p>America alone has provided more than $5bn in aid to the Palestinians since 1994. Many in the West Bank wonder where it went, as they drive on rutted roads and visit overcrowded hospitals. Close to a billion dollars is thought to have vanished during Mr Arafat’s rule. Today Mr Abbas is more interested in prosecuting anti-corruption activists than pursuing corruption. As long as his security forces keep the West Bank quiet, though, the world gives him a pass.</p><p>The endurance of Hamas and Fatah, Mr Abbas’s party, is indicative of how the Oslo era warped Palestinian politics. Majorities in the West Bank and Gaza think their leaders corrupt and authoritarian. But Fatah enjoys a measure of international legitimacy because it accepts a territorial compromise that is now a mirage; Hamas claims popular legitimacy by rejecting compromise and promising liberation, which is just as illusory.</p><p>To discard the land-for-peace framework would mean a sea change in Palestinian politics, reflecting a stark disjuncture between generations. Older people have spent a lifetime dreaming of an independent state. Asked why they do not abandon that dream and push for equality, they reply that Israel would never accept it. Many younger Palestinians disagree. The call for statehood, they argue, lets Israel frame the conflict as a struggle between two nations on a more or less equal footing. A battle for equal rights would put the onus more squarely on Israel.</p><p>The two-state paradigm turned the conflict into a land dispute. If negotiators could simply find the right path for a border, the weary parties could retreat to their respective sides. But this is also a conflict over how two peoples should live together on an uncomfortably small patch of land.</p><p>Delusions and reality<br>Some on both sides cling to fantasies. Right-wing Israelis persist in believing that the Palestinians can be persuaded to leave or be consigned to live as second-class non-citizens, a cheap labour pool content to cross teeming checkpoints each day to till fields and swing hammers. Groups such as Hamas still insist they can outlast Israel, that one day the Jews will pack up and “go back to Europe”, never mind that most of them are native-born (and often descended from Middle Eastern Jews rather than European Jews, to boot).</p><p>Here and there in Israel one sees a phrase in graffiti on walls in Hebrew and Arabic: ain lanu eretz aheret; la watan lanna badeel. “We have no other country.” The Arabs and Jews must decide how to share it; the world cannot dictate a solution. That will require a new peace process, a genuine one, with legitimacy and popular support on both sides. It is hard to envision such a process sprouting soon from such poisoned soil. But to acknowledge reality would be a start. What came before has failed, and what comes next will need to talk less of partition and more of parity. </p><p><a id="gay-people-are-reclaiming-an-islamic-heritage"></a></p><h1 id="Gay-people-are-reclaiming-an-Islamic-heritage"><a href="#Gay-people-are-reclaiming-an-Islamic-heritage" class="headerlink" title="Gay people are reclaiming an Islamic heritage"></a>Gay people are reclaiming an Islamic heritage</h1><p>In the old days Muslims were quite tolerant of homosexuality</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>For decades regimes in the Middle East have alleged that homosexuality is both morally unacceptable and a Western import. Many gay activists disagree on both counts. Homophobia is the Western import, they claim, introduced by puritanical Europeans. “Ban the colonial law,” cried campaigners in Tunisia in December, referring to a law criminalising gay sex written by the French more than a century ago. “All these homophobic laws in the Middle East were brought in by colonialism to undermine Islam’s permissive civilisation,” says Ramy Khouili, a Tunisian activist.</p><p>History is complicated, and prejudice has ancient roots. Nonetheless, activists can point to periods of the Islamic past when Arab rulers were more liberal about sex. They relate how the Caliph Amin in ninth-century Baghdad had a male lover and feted gay poets. They read poems from a classical genre called mujun, or hedonistic smut. And they recall that the Ottoman Turks, who ruled most of the Middle East in the 19th century, decriminalised homosexuality a century before America and Britain. Back then, “you could be with a man or a woman,” says the transgender founder of north Africa’s first gay movement, the Abu Nawas Association, named after a great Arab poet, who was gay. “There were men dressed as women and living as women—and it was normal.”</p><p>“A Promenade of the Hearts”, a collection of stories and poems compiled by Ahmad al-Tifashi, a 13th-century Arab sexologist, is experiencing a revival in Beirut’s libraries. The penis, he claims, is better shaped for anal than vaginal penetration. While much classical and Ottoman poetry features male lovers, gay groups are discovering lesbian poetry from the past. “How much have we grinded sister, ninety pilgrimages/ More delightful and invisible than the entries of the penis head,” reads a couplet.</p><p>Gay poetry is not the only art form undergoing a renaissance. Muhammad Issaoui, who calls himself “a queer dancer”, adapts the traditions of male belly-dancers once common in Cairo and Beirut. He performs in Tunisia’s clubs and theatres clad just in feather boas and underpants. “It was natural for men to express their feminine sides before,” he says. “It was just pleasure and art.”</p><p>Some activists are examining old legal texts—and finding contradictions. Classical jurists upheld the Koran’s clear prohibition of sodomy, yet debated how deep the penis must penetrate to be deemed a violation. (Up to the line of circumcision, according to a standard work written by Shia Muslims.) The present-day jihadists of Islamic State throw gay people off rooftops, citing a reported saying of the Prophet endorsing the practice. But scholars have struggled to find historical cases of anyone taking this verse literally.</p><p>This gay re-engagement with Islam has its critics. Many feminists are secular and see Muslim clerics as part of the patriarchy they want to topple. Still, most are willing to lend their support to gay people now facing arrest, torture and censorship by Arab rulers. “The problem isn’t Islam,” says Rasha Younes, a Lebanon-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, a monitoring group. “It’s the oppressive regimes who want to control us and the Middle East in its name.”</p>]]></content>

They like to elide “you” and “all” into a single-syllable word, and instead of the state government meeting annually, its citizen legislators are in session only every other year to discuss the budget and pass new laws. (This is despite Texas boasting the ninth-largest economy in the world, ahead of Brazil’s.) May 31st marks the end of the current legislative session in Austin, but the impact of the past few months will be felt for longer. “This was the most conservative session I’ve seen in 30 years,” says Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune, which keeps tabs on the state capitol.</p><p>If Texas is dancing the two-step, it is doing so with two right feet. Bills that might not have even been given a hearing in previous legislative sessions are passing both Republican-controlled chambers of the state legislature and being signed by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott. This includes one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, which bans the procedure as early as six weeks and makes no exception for rape or incest. “Permitless carry”, which enables those over the age of 21 to carry a handgun with them in public without going through training, fingerprinting or a background check, has also passed the legislature and will soon be signed into law. What once seemed a fringe preoccupation of a few lawmakers is now mainstream among Texas Repulicans.</p><p>The same is true of a new voting bill, which puts restrictions on polling places and their hours of operation, and was expected to be signed into law as The Economist went to press. The session also underlined where the front-line in the culture-wars is now: there was a bill banning the teaching of critical race theory (a particular approach to historical racial bias) in schools. One preventing transgender students from joining school sports teams that match the gender with which they identify narrowly missed a deadline. Another bill being considered would require sports teams that do business with the state to play the national anthem at every game. “Just when you think Texas couldn’t go further to the right, here we are,” says Mark Jones of Rice University.</p><p>This rightward-step took many by surprise, because the last time legislators convened the bills they passed were more concerned with governing than signalling. That session had followed Democratic gains in 2018, when Beto O’Rourke ran for the us Senate. In response Republicans adopted a strategy of self-preservation, mostly avoiding polarising social issues and focusing instead on priorities for mainstream voters, such as increasing funding for public education and capping property taxes.</p><p>Since then, the 2020 election has emboldened Republicans, who see self-preservation rather differently now. After boasting that they could well take control of the state House, Democrats failed to make inroads, both because campaigning was constrained by covid-19 and because national progressive rhetoric did not play well in Texas. Republicans have seized on this, and are using this legislative session to establish their credentials ahead of next year’s mid-term elections, when all 31 members of the Senate are up for election.</p><p>Members of the legislature fear Democrats less than losing to a conservative rival in the primary. “Nobody cares about November any more,” says Jason Sabo of Frontera Strategy, a lobbying firm. “The only thing that matters is March, and the only way to lose a Republican primary is if someone makes you look too liberal.” Mr Abbott, too, is using this legislative session to fend off conservative primary challengers next year, when he is up for re-election. He is believed to have presidential aspirations, and views the state’s fame for some of its more Trumpian laws as thoroughly good for his own national brand.</p><p>Texas may be a bellwether for national politics. It is also a showcase for the lingering influence of Donald Trump and his acolytes. Dan Patrick, the lieutenant-governor, twice chaired Mr Trump’s campaign in Texas. The state’s voting bill panders to the former president’s false claims of electoral fraud. “The only people who were at the Capitol in Austin were legislators and older white male lobbyists in pinstripe suits and cowboy boots,” says Mr Sabo. “I have seen more American-flag-wear in the last 25 days than I have in the last 25 years,” he adds. “It’s like a Trump rally.”</p><p>Meanwhile, plenty has been left undone. Consider Dallas Independent School District (disd), the state’s second-largest. Michael Hinojosa, the superintendent, says his biggest priority was to see that funding promised in the last session was not cut, a worry eased by the federal stimulus. But now, on top of trying to ensure that pupils catch up with the learning lost during the pandemic and the huge snowstorm in February, he will have to eliminate all black and Mexican-American studies courses at disd’s 37 high schools and redesign professional training for all 22,000 employees, because of a bill (which will probably pass) banning modish talk about accommodating people of different ethnic or racial backgrounds. Republicans enjoy bossing teachers around. Mr Abbott announced that public schools and other government entities can no longer require masks on their campuses from June 5th.</p><p>The trend of state government exerting power over local—largely liberal—cities and counties is playing out across Texas. The voting bill is another instance of the state trying to “micromanage” by telling counties where to put polling places and how long they can stay open, says Lina Hidalgo, the Democratic county judge of Harris County, which covers Houston. Other examples include new laws to stop local governments from allowing homeless encampments and to prevent them from defunding the police (which they are not actually doing). “We can finally retire the idea that local control is a conservative value,” quips Mr Smith of the Texas Tribune.</p><p>Legislators will be back in Austin this autumn for a special session on redistricting. Because the Democrats did not win control of the House, Republicans will have unchecked power to redraw districts to favour them. It will be hard to draw districts that last for more than a couple of election cycles, predicts Ed Emmett, a Republican who was county judge and lost to Ms Hidalgo. “If Republicans don’t start talking about issues that the general public cares about, we’re not going to be competitive,” he says. Yet similar pleas from moderate Texas Republicans have been heard before, and ignored.</p><p>Right now the headlines are focused on the bills being passed, but the session may be remembered just as much for what was ignored. This includes devising a plan for Texans who lack health-care coverage and shoring up the state’s electricity grid, after the February storm left millions without electricity and killed around 200. The legislature has not developed a substantive bill to prevent the grid from failing again, even though experts have warned that the summer heat could cause widespread blackouts. Their elected representatives may leave them without electricity, but at least Texans will not need a gun permit. </p><p><a id="the-george-floyd-act-is-a-police-reform-smorgasbord-would-it-work"></a></p><h1 id="The-George-Floyd-Act-is-a-police-reform-smorgasbord-Would-it-work"><a href="#The-George-Floyd-Act-is-a-police-reform-smorgasbord-Would-it-work" class="headerlink" title="The George Floyd Act is a police-reform smorgasbord. Would it work?"></a>The George Floyd Act is a police-reform smorgasbord. Would it work?</h1><p>Assessing the evidence for and against the bill</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>According to initial reports from the Louisiana State Police, Ronald Greene died in a car crash. This was in May 2019, one year before the murder of George Floyd. Mr Greene’s family was suspicious, so they pressed the police to release footage from the cameras worn by six of the officers on the scene. Not all the devices were switched on, and it took a 17-month wrangle before they could watch the footage (the public did not see it until the Associated Press leaked it, seven months after that). It showed the troopers repeatedly stunning Mr Greene with a taser, punching him, and leaving him moaning face-down on the road for nine minutes; he died on the way to hospital. The assault was recorded on body cameras.</p><p>After the murder of Mr Floyd a year ago, a police-reform bill named after him was introduced in Congress. It was passed by the House of Representatives but is pending in the Senate. The House version encompasses a range of policies, including restrictions on the use of force (any application of physical restraint other than handcuffing), creating a national database of officer misconduct, requiring federal officers to wear cameras and limiting qualified immunity (a judicial doctrine that shields officers from civil liability). Would it actually improve policing?</p><p>A large-scale study by the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago found that body cameras reduce the number of police misconduct complaints by 17%. They also probably reduce the use of force. But in 2020 only about 8,000 departments (about 45%) used such cameras and just seven states required them. The Floyd Act, as currently written, requires federal uniformed officers to wear body cameras, and requires state and local law enforcement to buy them with federal funds. Much of the Floyd Act applies only to federal officials: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Park Police, officers in the various federal departments, and others. They account for only about one-fifth of America’s 700,000 law-enforcement officers. But the bill could nevertheless serve as a standard for other departments, says Mark Levin, a lawyer at the Council on Criminal Justice, a think-tank.</p><p>Just putting cameras on officers is not enough, as shown by Mr Greene’s death. North Carolina requires a judge’s approval to release video footage, as does Louisiana, where Mr Greene was killed. Eleven other states also restrict public access to body-camera footage. By contrast, when Ma’Khia Bryant, a black teenager, was shot and killed by an officer in Ohio, the video footage was released publicly in a few hours. Ohio’s body-camera policy, signed by a Republican governor, John Kasich, in 2019, makes the footage part of the public record. As currently written, the Floyd Act requires federal agencies, in most cases, to release any footage showing a death or serious injury in police custody within five days of being asked to do so.</p><p>Some departments allow officers to decide themselves when to switch them on. Others have strict protocols for when a camera must be activated (at the start of any call, for example). Others use cameras activated automatically by sirens or drawing a gun from its holster. Such details matter. One study found that among officers systematically recording incidents on arrival, rather than using their discretion, use-of-force incidents decreased by 37% in comparison to officers not using body cameras. Among those who chose when to turn their cameras on and off, use-of-force incidents increased by 71% against this control group. Limiting discretion protects officers, too, argues Chad Marlow of the American Civil Liberties Union. “In the climate that we live in nowadays, if police officers have discretion and make the wrong call, a malevolent motive is going to be assigned to that officer.”</p><p>Some other parts of the bill are strongly supported by the evidence. De-escalation training—teaching officers techniques that require less frequent and less severe uses of force—was found to reduce use-of-force incidents by 28%, decrease citizen injuries by 26% and lower officer injuries by 36%. This sort of training, though effective, is required in only 16 states. But not all aspects of the Floyd Act are supported by rigorous evidence. Implicit-bias training, teaching officers about their unconscious biases, has been implemented in 69% of police departments. Yet the University of Chicago Crime Lab reckons that, as currently implemented, it is ineffective.</p><p><a id="for-the-biden-administration-the-northern-triangle-poses-a-migration-trilemma"></a></p><h1 id="For-the-Biden-administration-the-Northern-Triangle-poses-a-migration-trilemma"><a href="#For-the-Biden-administration-the-Northern-Triangle-poses-a-migration-trilemma" class="headerlink" title="For the Biden administration, the Northern Triangle poses a migration trilemma"></a>For the Biden administration, the Northern Triangle poses a migration trilemma</h1><p>Reduce migration, reduce corruption or be humane?</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Had the protest not been on the Mexican side of the border, it could have been mistaken for a rally for Joe Biden. Migrants sported white t-shirts emblazoned with the president’s campaign logo and the message “Biden Please Let Us In”. Critics say the president’s folksy manner is to blame for a surge in arrivals at the border that his administration is scrambling to contain. That may be unfair, but it reflects the discontent many Americans feel over his handling of immigration. It is one of the few policy issues where a majority disapprove of the president’s performance.</p><p>While some migrants—particularly from the “Northern Triangle”, as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are collectively known—may have been encouraged by Mr Biden’s promise of a “fair and humane immigration system”, most leave their homes for other reasons. Central America has the highest poverty rate, and some of the worst homicide and domestic violence rates, in Latin America. Families who have the means to legally move abroad do so, while those who do not will often take the long route north. Worsening natural disasters, such as back-to-back category-four hurricanes in 2020, also displace people.</p><p>Mr Biden is no stranger to the Northern Triangle’s woes. As Barack Obama’s vice-president he oversaw an effort to reduce migration by dealing with its root causes, a job he feels compelled to finish, says Paul Angelo, from the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. He has requested $4bn in aid for the Northern Triangle and chosen vice-president Kamala Harris to lead talks there. Ms Harris will visit Mexico and Guatemala in June, her first official trip abroad. And he appointed Ricardo Zúñiga, a senior member of the foreign service, as special envoy to the Northern Triangle.</p><p>Donald Trump froze aid in the hope of forcing governments to detain northbound migrants. This may have contributed to a dip in arrivals. Mr Biden hopes to accomplish something similar with programmes to reduce crime and poverty. Some have met success: according to usaid, in 2014-2017 community violence-prevention schemes helped to lower murder rates by 45% across 50 municipalities in El Salvador and 36% nationally in Honduras (other experts point to a crackdown in prisons and rumoured negotiations between gangs and politicians). Mr Biden has not abandoned harder options, however. His administration struck an agreement with Mexico and the Northern Triangle to beef-up their border security.</p><p>Yet working with central-American governments goes against another of Mr Biden’s impulses: fighting corruption. Over the past decade the rule of law has eroded in the Northern Triangle, according to Transparency International, a watchdog. The Universidad de las Américas Puebla ranked Honduras and Guatemala among the worst countries for impunity (Mexico trailed not far behind). Both scrapped international commissions that investigated and prosecuted crooked officials.</p><p>Finding a balance now falls to Ms Harris and Mr Zúñiga. The vice-president has conspicuously avoided criticising Andrés Manuel López Obrador despite some of his autocratic inclinations, in part because his co-operation on immigration is necessary. Meanwhile the Mexican president has rebuked America for giving aid to an ngo that has criticised his administration.</p><p>Mr Zúñiga has had a rocky start with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who has bristled at criticisms of his government’s tightening grip on power. And the Biden administration has given a wide berth to Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras, who stands accused in a court case in New York of taking bribes from drug traffickers. The us-Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act empowers the Department of State to identify corrupt officials and deny them entry into America. Several names have been added to the list, including Mr Bukele’s cabinet chief. The problem, warns Andrew Selee of the Migration Policy Institute, is that “in contexts where corruption is required to get things done, no one has clean hands.”</p><p><a id="how-to-build-back-under-budget-maybe"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-build-back-under-budget-maybe"><a href="#How-to-build-back-under-budget-maybe" class="headerlink" title="How to build back under budget (maybe)"></a>How to build back under budget (maybe)</h1><p>Lessons from the construction of the James Wilson line</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“This is a unique opportunity,” says Bent Flyvbjerg, an economic geographer who studies infrastructure projects. “There hasn’t been anything like it in the history of the United States.” He is referring to the Biden administration’s $1.7trn infrastructure plan. A group of Senate Republicans have countered with a $1trn offer. Whatever the final number, how can lawmakers make sure the money goes as far as possible?</p><p>The need to build new projects and repair old ones is not in dispute. Poor infrastructure costs trillions in foregone growth. A third of America’s bridges are structurally deficient. New structures, such as seawalls and storm barriers, are needed to help mitigate the effects of climate change. But productivity in public-sector construction has stagnated for decades and high costs abound, particularly where transport is concerned. The money needed to construct a mile of interstate highway rose threefold in real terms between the 1960s and the 1980s. American subway lines often cost between two and four times as much as typical projects in Europe or Asia.</p><p>Consider the James Wilson line, a hypothetical rail project named after The Economist’s founder and paid for with an influx of Biden bucks. Even before ground is broken, the cost forecasts are wildly inaccurate and prospective benefits dramatically inflated. A cost-benefit analysis is done, but elected officials discard its results in favour of political considerations. Mr Flyvbjerg argues that this all leads to the projects that look best on paper being implemented, “and the projects that look best on paper are the projects with the largest cost underestimates and benefit overestimates, other things being equal”.</p><p>Soon, a press release goes out announcing the construction of the Wilson line. Immediately vocal pressure groups demand expensive changes. By insisting on additional features like walls to contain noise and paths for pedestrians, this stirring display of participatory democracy adds new costs. Spooked by the response, the government takes expensive, pre-emptive steps to reduce the likelihood of litigation. A recent paper argues that such exercises of “citizen voice”—and governments’ fear of them—are a big cause of soaring highway-construction costs.</p><p>Leah Brooks, one of the paper’s authors, argues that legal and social changes in the 1970s set the stage for this situation. That decade saw the rise of homeowners’ associations, as well the introduction of legislation requiring more consideration of citizens’ concerns. New judicial doctrines increased the ability of citizens to sue executive agencies. The National Environmental Policy Act (nepa), a landmark piece of legislation passed in 1969, delivered valuable environmental protections. Combined with a Supreme Court decision that enhanced citizens’ ability to sue the government, nepa provided a “judicial toehold” from which to oppose new construction—whether or not the challengers’ concerns are genuinely motivated by a desire to protect the environment.</p><p>It is now time for a contract to be awarded for construction of the Wilson line. Best practice is to give out contracts on the basis of cost, speed, and a technical score determined by an in-house oversight team. But unfortunately the agency drawing up the contract does not have enough qualified staff to conduct a full review of construction proposals. The lowest bidder wins the job, as is typically the case in America. After winning, however, the contractor quickly tacks on additional costs, and the government is again in over its head. Unable to manage such a big project, it ends up relying on contractors and consultants who botch key segments of the Wilson line, requiring expensive do-overs. Inter-agency turf battles and co-ordination problems worsen the situation.</p><p>For the Wilson line’s underground sections, its builders choose to do things the hard way. Its stations, like those of New York City’s recently built Second Avenue subway, are unnecessarily large. And instead of digging the stations out from street level in a so-called “cut-and-cover” approach, which is the (cheaper) norm in sensible places like Denmark , the Wilson line’s builders choose to mine them from within a tunnel. Alon Levy, who studies transit infrastructure costs, says such mystifying choices come about because America has failed to copy other countries. Mr Flyvbjerg goes further: America has such an “island mentality”, he claims, that it doesn’t even consider outside ideas for long enough to reject them.</p><p>What can be done so that projects like the imaginary Wilson line do not go off the rails? State and federal agencies can ensure that teams have enough capacity to review multiple projects and to manage contractors. Being too punctilious can backfire, though: New York’s exacting requirements are partly responsible for the astronomical costs of subway construction there.</p><p>More advanced construction practices can also help. Standardisation of components like railway cars and subway stations can reduce variation, thereby shortening timelines and lowering costs. Transparency and accountability are vital as well. The Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for maintaining more than $300bn-worth of dams and levees, records cost data but does not make them public. Ms Brooks says it should. To mitigate the effects of citizen voice, she also suggests a statute of limitations on litigation for some infrastructure projects.</p><p>Donald Trump implemented nepa reforms which he said would speed construction, but which also did away with some valuable environmental protections. The Biden administration is considering rolling back these changes. nepa has been used to challenge not just polluting industrial facilities but renewable energy projects as well, and the threat of environmental lawsuits adds to infrastructure costs. Mr Biden is free to roll back Mr Trump’s changes— but he should consider making some of his own.</p><p><a id="america%E2%80%99s-sagebrush-rebellion-never-ended"></a></p><h1 id="America’s-Sagebrush-Rebellion-never-ended"><a href="#America’s-Sagebrush-Rebellion-never-ended" class="headerlink" title="America’s Sagebrush Rebellion never ended"></a>America’s Sagebrush Rebellion never ended</h1><p>There is an ideological link between the 1970s movement and recent wildlife-management laws</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Back in February, Montana’s Republican governor killed a wolf without a proper permit. Greg Gianforte, who is best-known for body-slamming a reporter on the campaign trail in 2017, trapped the creature after it strayed out of Yellowstone National Park and onto a private ranch owned by one of his political donors—the director of Sinclair Broadcast Group, whose 191 local tv stations might not frown on trapping liberals. A satirist could be proud of this Western. It also exemplified what Chris Servheen, a wildlife biologist in Missoula, describes as a new bout of “anti-predator hysteria” in state legislatures in the northern Rocky Mountains.</p><p>Lawmakers in Montana and Idaho have recently passed a slew of measures to reduce the number of bears and wolves in their states. In Idaho one law allows wolf-hunting from snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. It devotes money to private contractors tasked with hunting the animals down and removes limits for the number of wolves one person can kill. The law says that wolves can be killed so long as their number still exceeds the state’s recovery goal of 150 animals. That means 90% of the Gem State’s 1,500 wolves are at risk. Next door in Montana, Mr Gianforte has signed bills that, among other things, will extend the wolf-hunting season and reimburse hunters and trappers for their expenses.</p><p>Wolves are not the only predators in legislators’ cross-hairs. Grizzly bears are still protected in the Lower 48 under the Endangered Species Act (esa). But two new laws in Montana increase the likelihood that they will be killed, by banning state employees from moving bears that wander out of protected zones, and allowing people to kill a bear if they think it is threatening livestock. Republican senators from Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have also introduced a bill to remove grizzlies around Yellowstone from the endangered list. Mr Servheen, who led the Fish and Wildlife Service’s grizzly-bear recovery programme for 35 years, says the laws amount to the biggest attack on the region’s large predators since they were nearly wiped out by settlers in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>The laws’ proponents argue that the animals hurt ranchers and human hunters by preying on livestock and big game, such as elk. The data say otherwise. The number of cattle and sheep killed by wolves amounts to an insignificant fraction of Idaho’s livestock, and ranchers are compensated for their losses. There are also more elk today than when grey wolves were brought back to the state in 1995.</p><p>Why, then, are Republicans eager to kill the West’s big predators? The impulse behind these laws is not new. Andrew Isenberg, a historian at the University of Kansas and author of “The Republican Reversal: Conservatives and the Environment from Nixon to Trump”, says the threat wolves pose to ranchers is largely symbolic. The esa was passed in 1973 and signed into law by Richard Nixon. The law called for the protection of threatened animals and, crucially, the ecosystems they inhabit. But those protections were viewed by many westerners as overreach by the federal government, which, they argued, should have little say over how western lands are managed.</p><p>The animosity towards the esa and other federal regulations on land use in the West boiled over in the form of the Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s. The rebels—a coalition of ranchers, miners, loggers, oilmen, local officials and western politicians—fought to pass bills that would transfer the management of public lands to the states. Ronald Reagan famously told Utahns to “Count me in as a rebel” on the campaign trail in 1980. The Gipper’s election quieted the rebels, but fights over federal land flare up whenever the interests of westerners in extractive industries, ranching or state government clash with those of conservationists and, lately, climate scientists.</p><p>More recently, Donald Trump’s rollback of environmental laws gave would-be rebels something to cheer. The Trump administration took grey wolves off the endangered list and reduced the size of protected lands. State parties have kept it up. Republicans in Montana enjoy a trifecta, which means the party controls both chambers of the legislature and the governor’s mansion. Steve Bullock, the state’s previous governor and a Democrat, would probably have vetoed the predator laws.</p><p>Conservation once had bipartisan support. That consensus, argues Mr Isenberg, broke down during the oil crisis in the 1970s when the environment took a back seat to the pursuit of energy independence. Perhaps that calculation will shift again. Meanwhile, the wildlife wars rage on. “It’s like watching a car wreck in slow motion,” Mr Servheen says about Montana’s new bear laws, “when it’s your car and your family in it.” </p><p><a id="new-york%E2%80%99s-newest-island-reflects-the-city%E2%80%99s-spirit"></a></p><h1 id="New-York’s-newest-island-reflects-the-city’s-spirit"><a href="#New-York’s-newest-island-reflects-the-city’s-spirit" class="headerlink" title="New York’s newest island reflects the city’s spirit"></a>New York’s newest island reflects the city’s spirit</h1><p>Mix a hurricane, a billionaire backer, a British designer and plenty of lawsuits. Garnish with tulips</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Depending on tide levels, New York City is made up of 40-odd islands. Some are famous, like Ellis Island, where 12m immigrants officially entered America. Hart Island is where the city buries its poor. Rikers Island is a penal colony. But mostly, as former mayor, Michael Bloomberg once noted, “New York City’s smaller islands are our secret treasures.” Governor’s Island is a car-free park. City Island is a fishing village. As of May 21st, New York has a new, manmade, one: Little Island.</p><p>Little Island rests on 132 concrete “tulips” of different heights, which create rolling hills and winding footpaths over 2.4 acres (1 hectare). Designed by Thomas Heatherwick, a Brit with a talent for eye-catching public designs, the island is a whimsical delight. Like its neighbour the High Line, an obsolete freight track converted to public space which (in the before times) drew 8m visitors a year, it will be much visited.</p><p>It is also characteristically New York, a city enlivened by madcap projects. This one was the brainchild of Barry Diller, a billionaire media mogul. Mr Diller was asked to help rebuild a pier destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. He was keen to do something more architecturally ambitious. The project faced several legal challenges: its creator almost gave up on what had become known as Diller’s folly. Then Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, intervened to keep it afloat.</p><p>Mr Diller’s and his wife Diane von Furstenberg’s foundation spent $260m on Little Island. It will continue to maintain the island for the next 20 years. He says he understands people who say, “Why should somebody with money dictate what public places are like?” But, he says, that misses the point. Having the resources means he can “braze it through” while public officials delay.</p><p>The island opened just as the city begins to lift restrictions. Dan Doctoroff, Mr Bloomberg’s deputy mayor, who steered the city’s tilt toward the west side, sees Little Island as a catalyst for New York’s recovery. It is also part of the west side’s rebirth, which includes the High Line (Mr Diller and his wife were early champions of that too) and Hudson Yards, a huge redevelopment project. Google has leased some of the pier next door. To the south a garage for rubbish lorries is being converted to a sports field and a sandy beach. “The key,” Mr Doctoroff says, is to “create conditions where people want to do extraordinary things.”</p><p><a id="is-kamala-harris-a-gift-to-the-republicans"></a></p><h1 id="Is-Kamala-Harris-a-gift-to-the-Republicans"><a href="#Is-Kamala-Harris-a-gift-to-the-Republicans" class="headerlink" title="Is Kamala Harris a gift to the Republicans?"></a>Is Kamala Harris a gift to the Republicans?</h1><p>The vice-president already looks like her party’s prospective presidential nominee</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Here is what the millions of Americans who take their opinions from Fox News and related outlets have been hearing about Kamala Harris. The vice-president was put in charge of the southern border because she “has brown skin”. Her picture book, “Superheroes Are Everywhere”, was issued to migrant children, maybe corruptly. (“Is she profiting from Biden’s border crisis?” tweeted Republican supremo Ronna McDaniel.) Metropolitan elites worship her; Vogue, which ignored lovely Melania Trump, put her (her!) on its cover. Her entrepreneur niece, Meena Harris, is an anti-white racist queen of cancel culture.</p><p>In other words, while the mainstream media soberly cover Ms Harris’s efforts to win Joe Biden’s trust and master her portfolio (which includes Mexico and Guatemala but not the border, where her book has not been issued to anyone), she is being relentlessly defined on the right as a dishonest member of the corrupt elite with an agenda alien to white America. Tucker Carlson—who during the election campaign refused to pronounce Ms Harris’s Hindu name correctly—has neatly synthesised these two slanders. “She’s a globalist superhero. Just like Voldemort, you can’t really know how to pronounce her name.”</p><p>So far, so predictable, you might say. But Ms Harris is no ordinary vice-president. As the first non-white, female vice-president of a party that has made diversity an organising principle, she is the presumptive next Democratic presidential nominee. It is hard, even at this early stage, to imagine her being denied. Given the 78-year-old Mr Biden’s age, her elevation could be only three years off. And the election that would ensue—the Republicans’ worsening derangement suggests—may well be as crucial as the one just past. This raises the question of whether she has what it takes to rise above the right-wing slanders and appeal to middle America, as Barack Obama did, or whether she will be destroyed by them, as Hillary Clinton was. And it is making senior Democrats nervous. “Everyone is saying, ‘Oh God, Kamala is next and then we’re in trouble’,” says a Democrat close to the White House.</p><p>Oratory aside, Mr Obama’s success was based on an ability to reassure white Americans that was rooted in his intimate knowledge of them. The son of a white woman, brought up by his white grandmother, he promised better times for all and rarely mentioned race unprompted. Ms Harris is a different case. She is the daughter of South Asian and Jamaican immigrants, brought together by the civil-rights movement, who brought her up as black. Though nothing like the vindictive race-warrior of Mr Carlson’s fevered imagining, she leans into black identity politics more than the former president did.</p><p>This is a good way to win elections in California. It would be a disastrous general-election strategy, as shown by the white backlash to Mr Obama, notwithstanding his carefulness, and by Ms Harris’s failure to impress even black voters during her hapless presidential bid. African-Americans tend to support the Democratic candidate who seems likeliest to appeal to white voters, on which basis they preferred Mr Biden. And her Hail Mary effort to turn things round by accusing Mr Biden of racial insensitivity during a televised debate (“I do not believe you are a racist [but]…”) only confirmed them in their choice. Polls suggested that black voters found it cynical and insincere.</p><p>The coverage of her current job has also been mixed. She has been accused of failing to carve out a well-defined “Veep” role or hire a sufficiently politically savvy staff. This is probably unfair. Her pressing need is to do whatever Mr Biden (with whom she had some making up to do) wants in order to make his administration successful. And she appears to be doing that. She was involved in the recent Middle-Eastern diplomacy. She is due to visit Mexico City next week. Though inexperienced in foreign policy, she is a polished front-woman who espouses Mr Biden’s internationalist views. The criticism of her seems rather to reflect not only the underlying anxiety about her ability to succeed him, but also the unusual nature of her position.</p><p>Ever since Walter Mondale upgraded the vice-presidency in the late 1970s, most of its occupants have spent four years trying to make themselves useful; then a second term, if it transpired, laying the groundwork for a presidential run. The carping suggests Ms Harris is expected to do both things at once, which is unrealistic; and indeed she would be castigated if she tried to.</p><p>There is one political task she cannot delay, however. That is to understand why her presidential campaign failed, which was not mainly to do with her race or gender, however much of an electoral burden they may be. Her stump speech sounded like group-written marketing spiel (something about wanting to “prosecute the case against Donald Trump”). Her promise—quickly rescinded—to scrap private medical insurance suggested a politician who had no clear idea where or what she stood for: whether on the left, with an emphasis on expanding the government, or towards the centre, with more focus on enterprise and opportunity. This was why the pundits and donors who at first flocked to her quickly moved on. It was in turn why she resorted to playing the race card against Mr Biden. No wonder she makes some Democrats nervous.</p><p>Kamala chameleon<br>She should reflect on the fact that the centrist Mr Biden won as Mr Obama had before him: by promising hope, opportunity and togetherness for all. There is no evidence that Democrats can get round Americans’ mistrust of government and vexed racial politics any other way (however they may hope to govern). Mr Obama, a big admirer of Ms Harris, must believe she can pull off the same trick. Talking up her vice-presidential credentials was one of his two big political calls last year. The other was his initial dismissiveness of Mr Biden. It would be a terrible shame if the former president turned out to be wrong on both counts.</p><p><a id="the-americas---brazil%E2%80%99s-president-jair-bolsonaro-is-under-siege"></a></p><h1 id="The-Americas-—Brazil’s-President-Jair-Bolsonaro-is-under-siege"><a href="#The-Americas-—Brazil’s-President-Jair-Bolsonaro-is-under-siege" class="headerlink" title="(The Americas)—Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is under siege"></a>(The Americas)—Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is under siege</h1><p>As his popularity fades, the populist turns to patronage</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>There are many ways to describe pork-barrel politics in Brazil. They include tomá lá dá cá (give and take), troca de favores (trading favours), corporativismo (corporatism) and velha política (old politics). In 2018, on the campaign trail, Jair Bolsonaro used these and far ruder insults to disparage his fellow politicians, especially ones from the left-wing Workers’ Party (pt), which governed from 2003 to 2016 and was roiled by two big corruption scandals. As president, he vowed to advance his agenda without distributing cargos (jobs) or emendas (amendments: ie, pork).</p><p>The first sign he had given up on this “new politics” came in mid-2020, when he formed an alliance with a bloc of self-serving parties known as the centrão (big centre) in order to shield himself from impeachment petitions, of which there are now 117. Centrão support is never free. A recent investigation by Estado de S. Paulo, a newspaper, showed that last year Mr Bolsonaro’s government forked over 20bn reais ($3.9bn) through emendas do relator, or “chairman’s pork”, a reference to the chairman of the budget committee. At least 3bn reais were funneled through the development ministry to congressmen to fund public works and purchase farm equipment at inflated prices, sometimes through companies owned by relatives.</p><p>The scandal, which the press has dubbed tratoraço (roughly, “tractor-gate”), is the clearest proof yet of Mr Bolsonaro’s participation in pork-barrel politics. It is unfolding alongside an even bigger public-relations disaster: a parliamentary commission of inquiry ( cpi) into the government’s handling of the pandemic. The two crises demonstrate how Mr Bolsonaro has become increasingly weak and how Congress, which is known for virus-like opportunism, has used his vulnerability to strengthen itself. “The more fragile the president, the higher the cost of support,” explains Sylvio Costa of Congresso em Foco, a watchdog site.</p><p>Brazil’s political system, known as “coalition presidentialism”, is a hybrid between the presidential model of the United States and European-style parliamentary government. The president directs policymaking and drafts the budget but cannot get much done without Congress, where his or her party rarely has a majority. Most of Brazil’s 30 or so political parties lack ideological platforms; they back presidents in exchange for patronage. This favours vote-winning projects like paving roads or painting schools, rather than long-term planning, says Élida Pinto, a professor of public finances at Fundação Getulio Vargas (fgv), a university.</p><p>In 1994 six congressmen lost their posts as a result of a vote-buying scandal involving fake ngos. In 2005 a centrão lawmaker admitted that the pt was funnelling 30,000 reais per month to congressmen in exchange for legislative support. (He was kicked out of Congress but is now an ally of Mr Bolsonaro.) In 2014 prosecutors launched a probe called Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) which revealed a vast kickback scheme among construction firms, political parties and the state oil firm.</p><p>In response to protests, Congress passed a series of constitutional amendments aimed at reducing corruption while keeping congressmen sweet. Most emendas became in effect an automatic allowance (not at the president’s discretion) for lawmakers to spend in their constituencies. They had to follow new rules, such as providing receipts. But such restrictions made it harder for presidents to cobble together a coalition. When Dilma Rousseff, a pt president, was impeached in 2016, it was technically because she had hidden the size of Brazil’s budget deficit; but also because she struggled to manage an increasingly unruly Congress. She expanded her cabinet to 39 ministries in order to dole out patronage, but a recession in 2014-16 limited her scope.</p><p>Mr Bolsonaro is experiencing something similar. Brazil has had one of the worst covid-19 outbreaks in the world, with an official death count of more than 450,000. His strategy of downplaying the pandemic seemed to work last year, when a third of Brazilians received emergency aid. But this year a second wave has coincided with rising inflation, slow vaccination and a reduction in handouts. Mr Bolsonaro’s approval rating has fallen from 40% to below 30%. The speaker of the lower house, Arthur Lira, the only person who can open impeachment proceedings, warned of “bitter political remedies”.</p><p>But impeachment is unlikely, partly because Mr Bolsonaro in effect reinvented chairman’s pork at the end of 2019. Most of the new allowances went to lawmakers who voted for Mr Lira and the centrão’s pick to head the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, in leadership elections in February. Documents on government sites account for only around 1bn of the 3bn reais spent by the development ministry. The budget chairman, Domingos Neto, sent 110m reais to a city of 59,000 people of which his mother is the mayor. The ministry agreed to pay 500,000 reais apiece for tractors listed as costing 200,000. It insists that there were no irregularities.</p><p>A bigger threat to Mr Bolsonaro’s popularity is the cpi, which began hearing testimony in the Senate this month. Its daily sessions are broadcast live on tv, creating a macabre oral history of Brazil’s pandemic disaster. Two former health ministers said that the government’s initial strategy rested on herd immunity and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug promoted by Donald Trump. A Pfizer executive said that the government ignored six offers to sell Brazil vaccines. The health minister at the time, Eduardo Pazuello, a general who was also in charge when the city of Manaus ran out of oxygen, tried to skip testifying by saying he might have covid-19 himself.</p><p>Mr Bolsonaro “is becoming a prisoner of his unpopularity”, says Alessandro Molon, the leader of the opposition in the lower house. The latest polls show the president’s support falling in nearly every constituency, including among his strongest backers, such as evangelical Christians. His top rival in the 2022 election is likely to be Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former pt president whose popularity has recently increased. One poll suggests that if a runoff election were held tomorrow, 55% would pick him against just 32% for Mr Bolsonaro (the rest said neither). When Brazilians see Europeans and Americans getting vaccinated, they realise “our president is a caricature,” says Ciro Gomes, a former governor who also plans to run.</p><p>Mr Bolsonaro could recover before next year’s election. Vaccination is at last progressing and the economy is doing better than feared. The economy minister, Paulo Guedes, has urged Congress to reform taxes and the public sector. This would free up money for vote-winning programmes, he argues. But lawmakers want handouts too. “The centrão is not loyal,” warns Rebeca Lucena of bmj, a consultancy. “If the ship is sinking, it will jump to another.” </p><p><a id="a-massacre-adds-to-peru%E2%80%99s-election-woes"></a></p><h1 id="A-massacre-adds-to-Peru’s-election-woes"><a href="#A-massacre-adds-to-Peru’s-election-woes" class="headerlink" title="A massacre adds to Peru’s election woes"></a>A massacre adds to Peru’s election woes</h1><p>The government blames Marxist militants</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As omens go, it was a bad one. On May 23rd, less than two weeks ahead of Peru’s presidential run-off election, 16 people were massacred in a remote village in an area known as “vraem”, the valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers, where coca is grown. The area has been under a state of emergency since 2003.</p><p>The motive of the killers remains unclear. The authorities in Lima rushed to blame remnants of the Shining Path, a radical left-wing insurgency. Leaflets justifying the murders were left behind with the bodies. In the 1980s and 1990s the Shining Path was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. However, the mayor of Vizcatán del Ene district, where the massacre took place, told reporters that he thought drug traffickers were more likely to be responsible (though both could be true). The violence throws a grenade into Peru’s already tumultuous election.</p><p>On one side is Pedro Castillo, a rural school teacher who briefly shot to fame in 2017 when he led a long teachers’ strike. He is the candidate of Free Peru, a hard-left party. On the other is Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, who as president in 1990-2000 defeated the Shining Path, but who has been serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and other abuses since 2009. Mr Castillo and Ms Fujimori were never expected to reach the run-off. Neither polled well in the first round campaign. But in a crowded field of 18 candidates on April 11th, they came top, with 19% and 13% respectively, putting them through to the final vote.</p><p>Ms Fujimori had already been making much of Mr Castillo’s supposed Marxism. Billboards across Lima encourage people to vote against communism. On May 25th, after the massacre, she accused him of having ties to the militants she considers responsible, and thereby of threatening her father’s legacy. Mr Castillo denies any such connections. His supporters say he is not a communist. But a newly elected congressman from Free Peru, Guillermo Bermejo, is on trial for terrorism for collaboration with the Shining Path 13 years ago. (He calls the accusations “pure fantasy”.) He has been taped saying that if his party takes power, “we’re not going to give it up…we prefer to stay to establish a revolutionary process in Peru.” Mr Castillo has not rebuked him.</p><p>Ms Fujimori has problems of her own. She has been arrested three times and spent more than a year in prison in pre-trial detention on charges of accepting illegal campaign donations. She was released a year ago as part of a scheme to curb the spread of covid-19 in jails. The Castillo campaign argues that Ms Fujimori would turn the state into a patronage machine to benefit the rich and well-connected. Ms Fujimori says that she is innocent and the victim of political persecution.</p><p>Whoever wins on June 6th will face a mistrustful population and a fractured Congress, with ten parties splitting the 130 seats in the unicameral legislature. Thanks to a series of scandals and political feuds, Peru has rattled through four presidents in the past five years. This election may not end the instability. </p>]]></content>

America began overseeing talks between the Israelis and Palestinians three decades ago. But the Holy Land remains contested by two peoples who cannot bring themselves to live together. The fighting in May that left 242 Palestinians and ten Israelis dead accomplished nothing except to clear the field for the next round of fighting.</p><p>The peace process set up in the Oslo accords in 1993 aims to create two states that agree to disagree—using land swaps, security guarantees, a deal to share Jerusalem and a limited “right of return” for Palestinians. Israel’s prize was to be a thriving democracy and a sanctuary for Jews; for Palestinians it was the promise of self-rule. At times, peace has been tantalisingly close, only to recede again amid mutual recrimination.</p><p>Today, however, instead of being a pathway to peace, the two-state “process” is barring the route. Everyone pretends that peace is still on the agenda when, in reality, it is not. That is a formula for strife. Almost everything that matters can be deferred with the promise that, one day, it will be resolved in a deal that is perpetually over the horizon. It is also a formula that, by default, leads to a single state.</p><p>The idea that the two-state framework is harmful will not come as news to the Palestinians. Under it, the vision of a viable, contiguous, sovereign Palestine has receded. Palestinian territory in the West Bank is an archipelago in an expanding sea of Israeli settlements that are illegal under international law. Gaza is a solitary island, cut off by an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. The Palestinian Authority was supposed to be a government in waiting. Young Palestinians look on it as the agent of Israel’s occupation, even as they laud Hamas, the violent Islamist group that rules Gaza, for standing up to Israel.</p><p>In place of the stagnant two-state effort, the new Palestinian vision is to demand individual rights in one state. Those in Gaza and the West Bank resent needing Israel’s permission (often withheld) to travel to see their families. The recent fighting was fuelled by a dispute over property in East Jerusalem, where most Palestinians are mere “residents”. Even Israeli Arabs complain of inequality and rose up during the fighting in Gaza.</p><p>That leaves Israel in a quandary. It has thrived under Oslo. gdp per head has grown by over half in the past 30 years. Its Iron Dome missile-defence system largely shields it from Hamas’s attacks. A divided, weak Palestinian leadership suits Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who shows little interest in the Palestinians. And it’s not just him: the conflict did not feature much in any of the four elections Israel has held since 2019.</p><p>This cannot last. The Oslo figleaf lets Israel claim that the occupation will be undone in a final deal. As the interim power in charge, it has no duty to extend full rights to the West Bank. But 54 years after the six-day war, the idea of a temporary occupation rings increasingly hollow.</p><p>Without hope of an agreement, Israel’s critics have begun to talk of a “one-state reality”. This challenges Israel: as the Holy Land has as many Jews as Palestinians, it cannot remain both Jewish and democratic while permanently controlling all of that territory. Many critics of Israeli policy, including some liberal Jews, now compare the Palestinians’ treatment to apartheid.</p><p>The Palestinian demand for rights is resonating abroad, not least in the halls of America’s Congress. By allying Israel to the Republican Party, Mr Netanyahu has helped make the Palestinians part of America’s culture wars. Progressives in the Democratic Party have started to declare that Palestinian lives matter.</p><p>America is Israel’s most important ally. True, American aid matters less than it did and Israel now produces most of its own advanced weapons. It has relations with more countries, including its Arab neighbours through the Abraham accords. Yet if it drifts away from Europe and America and towards countries like Russia, China and populist India, it will be a blow to Israel as a Western, liberal and democratic ideal.</p><p>More important, Mr Netanyahu’s “anti-solutionism” leaves his country less able than ever to navigate a future with the Palestinians. His embrace of the Jewish far right makes eruptions more likely even as it fires up militant Palestinians—witness the recent communal violence in Israeli cities. The wall that seals off Israel from the West Bank has led to deeper distrust between Arabs and Jews. The settlements, once thought negotiable, have become permanent obstacles to peace.</p><p>The status quo has served Israel well but is not sustainable. Sooner or later there will be a reckoning that requires a new formula for living next to the Palestinians. Adhering to Oslo while undermining it in practice feeds the reality of one state—because it makes two states harder to realise.</p><p>Instead of imposing peace in one top-down stroke of diplomatic brilliance, a more realistic aim would be to build it patiently from the bottom up. The guiding principle should be to focus on the human and civil rights of Palestinians. Israel will not grant Palestinians full rights tomorrow. But it can make its Arab citizens more equal by devoting resources to their communities. It could make the administration of Jerusalem more inclusive, so that tiffs over fencing do not escalate into war. It must take more responsibility for the suffering in the West Bank and Gaza—and work harder to alleviate it.</p><p>A focus on rights also makes Palestinian leaders more accountable. They cannot easily demand rights from Israel that they deny their own people. Mahmoud Abbas is in the 17th year of a four-year term as president. His Fatah party is sclerotic. Hamas tramples the rights of its people, including women and minorities. Better Palestinian leaders are a prerequisite for peace.</p><p>Abandoning Oslo carries risks, obviously. Unbound, Israeli settlers might push farther into Palestinian territory. Hamas, which wants a single state in which Palestinians would outweigh Jews, might redouble its resistance. But today’s path is even riskier.</p><p>Peace always starts by acknowledging reality. It takes root by improving lives and renewing politics. That can flourish into something new. Then, one day, the parties can start talking again about a deal, whether of one state or two. </p><p><a id="firms-are-rediscovering-their-love-for-capex-good"></a></p><h1 id="Firms-are-rediscovering-their-love-for-capex-Good"><a href="#Firms-are-rediscovering-their-love-for-capex-Good" class="headerlink" title="Firms are rediscovering their love for capex. Good"></a>Firms are rediscovering their love for capex. Good</h1><p>That is both a radical change and an enormously important one</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As the rich world reopens, the contours of the post-pandemic economy are becoming clear. The latest trend is a global surge in capital spending. Forecasters reckon that overall real investment worldwide will soon be a fifth higher than it was before the pandemic. America’s business investment is rising at an annual rate of 15%. By 2022 companies in the s&amp;p 500 are forecast to be spending over a tenth more on factories, technology, r&amp;d and the like. Barely a day goes by without a large firm boasting about how much it plans to splurge. at&amp;t says it will throw $24bn a year at its networks. Sony is piling $18bn into an expansion push. Semiconductor firms are engaged in one of the biggest capital-spending (or capex) sprees in history.</p><p>That is both a sharp change and an enormously significant one. Sharp, because before covid-19 managers embraced capex austerity. America’s business investment had stagnated relative to gdp for several decades. Britain’s was 15% lower than in the late 1990s. Even as business profits soared, firms devoted a smaller share of their cashflows to capex and r&amp;d, and more to share buybacks and dividends. Significant, because investment in new technologies and business practices is the secret sauce behind higher living standards. Weak capital spending contributed to the rich world’s sluggish productivity and growth in the 2010s, and to the gnawing sense that capitalism was misfiring.</p><p>Now, though, all that is changing. Fiscal stimulus has put money in people’s pockets. In America real disposable income per person is 27% higher than it was in February 2020. And as economies reopen, people are in the mood to spend. Companies can thus be more confident there will be demand for their wares in the next few years—as good an incentive as any to expand capacity. Some firms, especially in consumer-facing industries, are low on inventory and are frantically trying to catch up.</p><p>Yet capital spending is rising not just because the economic cycle is on the up. Firms are also adjusting to permanent pandemic-induced shifts, from an emerging norm of “hybrid work” to greater online shopping. The big tech firms, whose products are so important to this shift, have led the investment charge. In 2020 they accounted for a third of total r&amp;d spending in the s&amp;p 500; this year they are boosting capex by 30% relative to 2019.</p><p>Other companies now recognise that they need to pull up their socks. High-street retailers are at last investing heavily in online offerings to compete with Amazon. Restaurants continue to improve their dine-at-home service even as dine-in reopens, allowing them to squeeze more sales out of preparing food. Consultancies are finding ways to let their staff remain connected when they are not in the office. Growth in global shipments of computers for companies will be even faster this year than last. All this promises a world in which people get more done in less time.</p><p>Firms in some industries still play by the rules of the 2010s. Mining companies seem cautious about shelling out in order to relieve supply bottlenecks in commodity markets. Big hotel chains appear to have no plans to install rainforest showers in every room. And it remains to be seen whether the post-pandemic norm will be one of structurally higher investment spending, or whether firms slip back into their old ways. For now, though, stand back and appreciate the global capex surge. It promises a more dynamic form of capitalism. </p><p><a id="germany-must-learn-to-live-with-a-little-inflation"></a></p><h1 id="Germany-must-learn-to-live-with-a-little-inflation"><a href="#Germany-must-learn-to-live-with-a-little-inflation" class="headerlink" title="Germany must learn to live with a little inflation"></a>Germany must learn to live with a little inflation</h1><p>The alternative is a two-speed Europe</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Inflation in germany exceeded 2% in April. If the Bundesbank’s latest forecasts prove right, it could soon reach 4% for the first time in nearly 30 years. Inflation angst is rising among the country’s monetary hawks. The exigencies of the pandemic muted German grumbling about the European Central Bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy. But as inflation rises, so will reflexive German demands that the bank should taper its bond-buying.</p><p>Such clamouring would be misguided. Europe’s recovery is more subdued than America’s, making the odds even better that the inflation spike will prove temporary. And the interests of the weaker members of the currency union, still crawling their way back to health, should come first.</p><p>The hyperinflation of the 1920s etched inflation-phobia deep into the German psyche. After the second world war the Bundesbank earned a fearsome reputation by being the first to tame the inflationary beast. In the early 2000s, shortly after the birth of the euro, Germany restrained wage costs and the southern European economies lost competitiveness against it. As the southerners recovered from their debt crises, they narrowed the gap by clamping down on their own labour costs, while Germany did too little to adjust. That set the euro zone on a demand-deficient, deflationary path. The area’s economy has never fully recovered, even as the ecb has used up most of its ammunition.</p><p>That lost decade is one reason why spiralling wages and prices in Europe are vanishingly unlikely, even as overheating is a possibility in America. What is more, the hit from the pandemic in Europe has been worse. Output in the euro zone fell further than in America last year. Despite this, its fiscal stimulus looks stingy compared with the Biden administration’s largesse. The eu’s new €750bn ($919bn) recovery fund will take years to be disbursed fully. Investors expect inflation in five years’ time to languish below the ecb’s target of “close to, but below 2%”. Expectations in America, by contrast, are above 2%.</p><p>Further reassurance can be gained from peering into the mechanics of Germany’s inflation spike. As in America, it reflects some transitory global factors, including the oil-price collapse last spring which depressed the base used to calculate the annual rate. Strip out food and energy prices, and inflation in Germany was only about 1% in April. Some temporary country-specific issues are also in play. A carbon charge has pushed up prices, and an emergency cut to value-added taxes last year will arithmetically boost inflation later this year. Look along the supply chain and you might take fright at Germany’s producer-price inflation, of more than 5% in April. But this should ease as factories and suppliers respond to a surge in orders.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest reason why Germany should tolerate a period of above-target inflation is that the euro area’s health depends on it. Activity is resuming across the zone, as vaccines are administered and lockdown restrictions lifted. Germany has less lost ground to make up than most. It suffered a deep downturn last year, with the economy shrinking by 5%, but it fared far better than France, Italy and Spain, where output fell by nearly twice as much. Unemployment in Germany remains low, at 4.5%. Its reliance on manufacturing and exports has been a boon. Other countries, by contrast, must pray that spending on tourism, retail and hospitality returns to the levels of the old days. Goldman Sachs, a bank, reckons that Spain and Italy have twice as much economic slack as Germany.</p><p>The ecb sets monetary policy for the currency union as a whole, not its largest member alone. And so Germany must seek to keep its economy humming along while the others catch up and the stimulus is withdrawn. That is the price of being one of the strongest members of a currency union. After a lost decade, the euro zone has learned from some of the mistakes of the past crisis. The pursuit of balanced budgets and austerity has been abandoned for the time being. The eu is on the verge of issuing common debt to finance its recovery fund. Both shifts were possible because of a change of thinking in Berlin. A recognition that the German economy must run hot is the missing link in restoring confidence throughout the euro zone. </p><p><a id="it-is-time-to-clean-up-the-air-in-buildings"></a></p><h1 id="It-is-time-to-clean-up-the-air-in-buildings"><a href="#It-is-time-to-clean-up-the-air-in-buildings" class="headerlink" title="It is time to clean up the air in buildings"></a>It is time to clean up the air in buildings</h1><p>Fresh thinking about fresh air</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 1842 edwin chadwick, a British social reformer, published his “Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population”. By documenting evidence of social and geographic inequalities in health, Chadwick showed that poor sanitation was associated with poor health. The report eventually led British cities to organise clean water supplies and to centralise their sewage systems, in turn reducing the prevalence of infectious diseases, in particular cholera. Similar reforms around the world in the 20th century tackled food safety and outdoor-air pollution. Now a new public-health priority is becoming apparent: making indoor air cleaner.</p><p>Take schools. They are “chronically under-ventilated”, according to the Lancet covid-19 commission. A study of 100 American classrooms found 87 with worryingly low ventilation rates. Across Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden, researchers found that indoor-air quality in 66% of classrooms fell short of healthy standards. In America nearly one child in 13 has asthma—a condition triggered by allergens often found in schools. Outdoor-air pollution can penetrate inside buildings—childhood exposure can affect neurodevelopment and academic performance, and cause cancer.</p><p>The problem extends well beyond classrooms. Many people spend more than 90% of their time indoors. Researchers have linked under-ventilated spaces in buildings to a range of ailments—headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, coughs, dizziness, nausea, and irritation of eye, nose, throat and skin. Poor ventilation has been blamed for increased absences from work, decreased productivity and asthma.</p><p>The pandemic has brought a new urgency to the matter. The virus which causes covid-19 spreads between people less by close contact and infected surfaces and more by hitching a ride on aerosol particles from people’s lungs that can linger in the air of an ill-ventilated room.</p><p>Indoor-air quality has attracted little government attention. But achieving clean, pathogen-free air in buildings and indoor public spaces is possible. The first step is to give people more information on how well-ventilated their air is. Carbon-dioxide concentrations are a good proxy for ventilation, and cheap sensors to detect this gas in rooms could provide occupants with useful data on when to open windows or upgrade their air-conditioning systems. National indoor-air-quality standards would help. One way to enforce them could be through ventilation certificates for buildings, similar to food-hygiene certificates that already exist for restaurants.</p><p>The bill for all this need not be huge. A recent study found that raising the standard of ventilation in all American elementary and secondary schools to the minimum level would cost less than 0.1% of the country’s typical public spending on education. President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan assigns $123bn to improving school infrastructure and mentions ventilation as a priority. Other countries should follow suit.</p><p>More investment would be money well spent. Better indoor air boosts academic performance—maths and reading scores go up, and pupils are measurably more attentive in class. Office-workers benefit, too. Researchers have found the cognitive scores of people in well-ventilated offices are 61% higher than those of workers in conventional office set-ups.</p><p>Ventilation is the forgotten part of the agenda for improved public health. Chadwick’s report on sanitation lifted people’s expectation that the water coming out of their taps would be clean. Covid-19 should lead policymakers to ensure, belatedly, that the same is true for the air in people’s buildings.</p><p><a id="voters-should-curb-mexico%E2%80%99s-power-hungry-president"></a></p><h1 id="Voters-should-curb-Mexico’s-power-hungry-president"><a href="#Voters-should-curb-Mexico’s-power-hungry-president" class="headerlink" title="Voters should curb Mexico’s power-hungry president"></a>Voters should curb Mexico’s power-hungry president</h1><p>Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pursues ruinous policies by improper means</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In a world plagued by authoritarian populists, Mexico’s president has somehow escaped the limelight. Liberals furiously condemn the erosion of democratic norms under Hungary’s Viktor Orban, India’s Narendra Modi and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, but barely notice Andrés Manuel López Obrador. This is partly because he lacks some of the vices of his populist peers. He does not deride gay people, bash Muslims or spur his supporters to torch the Amazon. To his credit, he speaks out loudly and often for Mexico’s have-nots, and he is not personally corrupt. Nonetheless, he is a danger to Mexican democracy.</p><p>Mr López Obrador divides Mexicans into two groups: “the people”, by which he means those who support him; and the elite, whom he denounces, often by name, as crooks and traitors who are to blame for all Mexico’s problems. He says he is building a more authentic democracy. It is an odd creature. He calls a lot of votes, but not always on topics that are best resolved by voting. For example, when legal objections are raised to one of his pet projects—moving an airport, building a pipeline, blocking a factory—he calls a referendum. He picks a small electorate that he knows will side with him. When it does, he declares that the people have spoken. He has even called for a national referendum on whether to prosecute five of the six living ex-presidents of Mexico for corruption. As a stunt to remind voters of the shortcomings of previous regimes, it is ingenious. It is also a mockery of the rule of law.</p><p>The president’s scorn for rules is one reason the elections on June 6th matter. He is not on the ballot; his single six-year term expires in 2024. But the national legislature is up for grabs, as are 15 of 32 governorships, most state assemblies and thousands of local posts.</p><p>Voters have a chance to rein in their president by rejecting his party, Morena. It is not clear that they will. Most are dissatisfied with the way the country is being run, but 61% approve of Mr López Obrador himself. Many feel that he cares about ordinary people, even if he has not materially improved their lives. The opposition parties have failed to offer a coherent alternative. Morena is slipping in the polls, but may retain its majority in the lower house, with the help of its allies. The more levers he controls, the further Mr López Obrador can pursue his plan to transform Mexico.</p><p>He has done good things, such as bumping up pensions and subsidising apprenticeships for the young. Though a leftist, he has kept spending and debt under control, so Mexico’s credit rating remains tolerably firm. But he suffers from what Moisés Naím, a Venezuelan journalist, calls “ideological necrophilia”—a love of ideas that have been tried and proved not to work.</p><p>He has fond memories of the 1970s, when a government-owned oil monopoly spread largesse around his home state. He is trying to recreate something similar, by all but banning private investment in hydrocarbons and forcing the grid to buy power from state sources first, no matter how costly and filthy they are. He likes railways, so he is ploughing $7bn into a diesel-burning boondoggle in his home region. Frustrated with officials who fuss about rules and putting contracts out to tender, he enlists the army to build his railway, run ports and fight crime. In other countries, inviting the men with guns to handle huge sums of public money with scant supervision has proved catastrophic, as any Egyptian or Pakistani could warn him. But Mr López Obrador is notorious for not listening to advice. His catchphrase in cabinet meetings is “Cállate!” (Shut up).</p><p>His disdain for expertise has made government less competent. His tree-planting scheme has encouraged farmers to chop down old trees so as to be paid to plant new ones. His policy of “hugs, not bullets” for gangsters has failed to reduce a stratospheric murder rate. For all his railing against graft, Mexicans report as many demands for bribes from officials as before.</p><p>He was woefully slow to respond to covid-19 and spent far too little on cushioning its economic effects. According to The Economist’s estimates, Mexico has suffered 477,000 excess deaths from the pandemic, one of the worst rates in the world; and its gdp shrank by 8.5% last year. The country should be poised for galloping growth. Multinationals are eager to diversify their supply chains away from China, and Mexico is a manufacturing hub next to the United States, which is entering a stimulus-stoked post-covid boom. Yet investors are wary.</p><p>They fear the uncertainty of rule by presidential whimsy. Mr López Obrador is undermining checks on his power. He leans on advertisers not to support fault-finding media. He cuts the budgets of watchdogs, or stuffs them with his supporters. Last week he said he would replace the central-bank governor with someone who favours “a moral economy”. He has threatened the body that runs elections.</p><p>The next three years will determine the depth and duration of the damage he does to Mexico and its democracy. He is barred from seeking re-election, but is trying illegally to extend the term of a friendly supreme-court judge. Critics fear he wants to set a precedent for himself. Mexico’s institutions are strong, but may buckle under sustained assault by a zealot with popular support. The country escaped de facto one-party rule in 2000. Given the risk, voters on June 6th should support whichever opposition party is best placed to win, wherever they live. The opposition parties should work together to restrain the president.</p><p>Learn from your mistakes<br>They should learn from him, too. He is popular partly because they did a poor job of helping those left behind during the long boom that followed economic liberalisation in the 1980s; and also because much of the ruling class really is corrupt. Mr López Obrador’s ad hoc, lawless approach has not made Mexico cleaner, but he has highlighted the need for a clean-up.</p><p>The United States needs to pay attention. Donald Trump did not care about Mexican democracy. President Joe Biden should make clear that he does. He must be tactful: Mexicans are understandably allergic to being pushed around by their big neighbour. But America ought not to turn a blind eye to creeping authoritarianism in its backyard. As well as sending vaccines, unconditionally, Mr Biden should send quiet warnings. </p><p><a id="briefing---mexico%E2%80%99s-populist-president-faces-a-crucial-test-in-elections-in-june"></a></p><h1 id="Briefing-—Mexico’s-populist-president-faces-a-crucial-test-in-elections-in-June"><a href="#Briefing-—Mexico’s-populist-president-faces-a-crucial-test-in-elections-in-June" class="headerlink" title="(Briefing)—Mexico’s populist president faces a crucial test in elections in June"></a>(Briefing)—Mexico’s populist president faces a crucial test in elections in June</h1><p>The vote could either curb him or empower him to take Mexico back to the 1970s</p><p>来源：2021-05-29 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The plaque beneath a bust of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in his home town proclaims him “the face of hope” and a “tireless fighter for the rights of Mexicans”. That is certainly how the people there see him.</p><p>“Andrés Manuel is different,” says Heberto Priego Colomé, a pensioner sitting in the shade in Tepetitán, a settlement of 2,000 souls in Tabasco state in southern Mexico. “He’s normal. He’s sincere. He talks to the people.” He has also “sent lots and lots of help”. The old man gestures to a fancy new plaza with a basketball court and a diving board from which younger folk can plunge into a river. When the president visited, he threw a party on the plaza.</p><p>Mr Priego Colomé ticks off other benefits Tepetitán’s favourite son has brought: bigger public pensions, a training programme for the young, a scheme whereby old rural folk are paid to plant trees, and a new refinery that will bring jobs to Tabasco. When the river flooded last year, the president sent every household in the affected areas a fridge, a mattress, a stove, a fan, some pans and a blender, plus 8,000 pesos ($400). Some had received 10,000 pesos after earlier floods.</p><p>Mr López Obrador is not a conventionally skilled orator. He rambles and repeats himself. But he connects with Mexico’s have-nots and makes them feel seen and respected. Rarely has a Mexican president attracted such adulation—and loathing. To his supporters, who are largely rural, hard-up or old, he is the first national leader since the 1930s who truly cares about them. To his detractors, he is an incompetent demagogue who could drag Mexico back to its pre-democratic past.</p><p>At elections on June 6th Mexicans will have a chance to endorse one or other of these views. Mr López Obrador is not on the ballot—he is not halfway through his six-year term. But they will be voting for the lower house of the national legislature, 15 state governorships, 30 out of 32 state assemblies and thousands of local posts such as mayor. Voters can either boost Mr López Obrador’s party, Morena, or clip its wings.</p><p>Mr López Obrador has attracted far less global attention than other populist leaders. But look closer and he appears astonishingly similar to them (see table). In his eyes, Mexicans fall into two groups: the people, whose authentic will he represents, and the elite, who are to blame for all Mexico’s ills. He sees himself as on a historic mission to sweep away the rotten habits of the past and establish a republic of virtue.</p><p>If he is on a mission from God, his opponents must be working for the other side, and he lets them know it. Mr López Obrador’s predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, is a “spineless, immoral, unpredictable sycophant”. Others he has called “apprentice pickpocket” or “reverend thief”. In his daily two- to three-hour-long press conferences, he blasts individuals, such as critical journalists. Some have received death threats from his supporters.</p><p>He is ostentatiously austere. On assuming office, he halved the presidential salary and put the presidential jet up for sale; he flies economy class. The poor applaud such gestures. But by cutting his own pay, he also cut that of top civil servants; no government employee may earn more than the head of state. Many of the best-qualified quit. “Mexico was building a civil service that was professional and serious. That’s now broken,” says Montserrat Ramiro, a former energy regulator. On May 25th the United States downgraded its rating of the safety of flying over Mexico, citing regulatory laxity. A buyer has yet to be found for the presidential plane.</p><p>Few would quarrel with Mr López Obrador’s diagnosis that too much of Mexico’s political class was corrupt and ignored the vast majority of Mexicans. His goals are good: to raise incomes, improve public services, cut crime and eliminate corruption. But criticisms that he selects the wrong policies to achieve them, implements them ineptly and tries to nobble any institution that gets in his way hit the mark.</p><p>Not his finest hour<br>Consider his record on covid-19. The official death toll is 220,000, which is bad enough. The Economist’s excess-death model estimates that as of May 10th, 477,000 more Mexicans had died than would normally be expected—a rate 68% higher than in Brazil, a bungler too.</p><p>The toll is partly down to Mexico’s crowded cities and overweight population. But a panel commissioned by the World Health Organisation also found “major deficiencies in decision-making” by the government. Mr López Obrador was slow to act, set aside too little money and slashed research funding. He failed to wear a mask in public and said Mexicans could curb the spread of the virus by not lying or stealing.</p><p>The infection rate is falling, but the human cost has been immense. Gregoria, who sells single cigarettes and tamales in Mexico City, says two of her brothers died of covid-19, aged 52 and 62. She adds that the pandemic has driven away her customers; the government has given her no help.</p><p>Mr López Obrador has done little to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic because he is terrified of debt. A currency crisis in 1994 taught him that too much debt can cripple the government and let foreign creditors boss Mexico around. So his fiscal response to covid-19 has been among the most parsimonious in Latin America. Mexico’s credit rating remains tolerably firm. But more than 1m Mexican businesses went bust in the past two years. The economy shrank by 8.5% last year.</p><p>Even as bars remain open, schools have been closed for 14 months (some are reopening as teachers get jabbed). Teachers’ unions have strained to keep them shut. They are very powerful: in one state, Oaxaca, a union controls the distribution of federal funds to the state government. Mr Peña Nieto tried to curb the unions’ power. Mr López Obrador has restored it.</p><p>The president’s policies are an eclectic mix of statism, nationalism and nostalgia for the 1970s. Take energy. Back in the 1970s, oil prices were high and Mexico’s state oil monopoly was a mainstay of the economy, especially in Mr López Obrador’s home state. Like a boutique that stocks bell-bottoms, he is trying to revive a questionable old fashion. He has all but banned foreign investment in Mexican oil and is pouring cash into an $8bn refinery in Tabasco, to be run by Pemex, the mega-lossmaking national oil firm.</p><p>Mr López Obrador has ordered cfe, the state electricity provider, to buy state-generated power first, rather than the cheapest option. This is often from dirty oil—so high in sulphur that its use is banned in most ships. Cheaper, cleaner options exist, but these are usually produced by private and often foreign firms, which Mr López Obrador distrusts. His policies have raised questions about $26bn of private investments already made in solar and wind energy in Mexico. This deters investors.</p><p>Fed up with bureaucratic delays, Mr López Obrador has turned to the army, which follows orders promptly. It now watches the border, runs ports, helps catch criminals, distributes textbooks and vaccines, and is building 2,700 branches of “the Bank of Wellbeing”, a state-run bank to disburse cash to the needy. Men in uniform are also building a hopelessly uneconomic $7bn railway loop around his home state, paid for by the taxpayer. On completion the army will own it and pocket the income. For now the army is relatively clean—and respected. That may change if its leaders are tempted by the vast sums of money they suddenly control.</p><p>Mr López Obrador’s crusade against corruption has been selective. He has imposed tougher punishments for bribe-taking officials and clamped down on firms that sell facturas (bills that can be used for tax deductions). However, fewer government contracts are put out to tender than in the past. Mexicans tell pollsters they are asked to pay bribes as much as before.</p><p>The president’s vow to curb violence has proved hollow, too. The murder rate, five times that of the United States, has barely budged. Gangs control huge swathes of territory, corrupt the police and pull the strings of local mayors.</p><p>Could try harder<br>It is not Mr López Obrador’s fault that drugs are illegal in the United States, nor that this generates vast profits for Mexican criminals. Nonetheless, his efforts to stem the mayhem have been limp. He blames poverty for crime, and promises to create more jobs for the young. But at the same time he has replaced the federal police with a more militarised outfit, the National Guard, under command of the army.</p><p>Under the slogan of “hugs, not bullets”, he has taken a soft approach to gangs. In 2019 he freed a drug kingpin’s son, hoping to buy a respite from the killing. He did not get one. The implied message to the gangs has been “You can do what you like and we won’t ask for anything in return,” says Jorge Castañeda, an ex-foreign minister.</p><p>For many, Mr López Obrador’s gravest flaw is disregard for the rule of law. He cancelled a half-built new airport for Mexico City. After the decision was challenged in court, he called an unlawful referendum, in which a tiny electorate gave him a green light. Claiming that the people had spoken, he pressed ahead.</p><p>This has become a habit. He used a similar plebiscite to “approve” a gas pipeline, and another to halt construction of an American-owned brewery. Such shenanigans appal business folk. “We have lost certainty for investment, and for the future of Mexico as a democracy,” says one. Foreign direct investment (fdi) should be booming, as firms scramble to diversify their supply chains away from China. Mexico has a sophisticated industrial base and the world’s biggest national market on its doorstep, where demand for manufactured goods has been strong in the past year and which is starting a post-lockdown boom. Yet fdi has fallen under Mr López Obrador. A rise in the first quarter of this year included few new projects. “Firms are investing only to maintain existing projects,” says Luis Rubio, an economist.</p><p>A bad way to run things<br>Mr López Obrador is trying to inject the “people’s will” into criminal justice, too, proposing a referendum on whether to prosecute five of his predecessors for corruption. He has also pressed an independent-minded judge to resign and signed a law extending the term of the friendly chief justice of the Supreme Court. The court will rule as to whether this is legal—which it plainly is not. Mr López Obrador’s critics fear he is trying to set a precedent. For a Mexican president to stand for a second term is taboo. But what if he were merely to extend his first term, perhaps claiming that the people demanded it?</p><p>Mr López Obrador assails institutions as eagerly as children thwacking a piñata. He stifles the media by leaning on businesses not to advertise in critical outlets. He cuts the budgets of recalcitrant agencies. He wants to abolish inai, the transparency agency, arguing that such a body is unnecessary when the president is an honest fellow like himself. He has threatened the institute that oversees elections, too. Critics fear he will do away with it and have elections run by the presidential office.</p><p>His social programmes have done some good. His pensions rises and the minimum wage have helped many. His schemes to support young and rural people are well-meaning. Some 330,000 Mexicans aged 18-29 get 4,310 pesos a month through year-long apprenticeships. Over 420,000 old rural folk are paid to plant trees.</p><p>Yet both programmes are badly designed. Some farmers chop down trees so they can be paid to plant more. Some plant species that wilt in the local soil. The youth programme is chaotic. No one checks if the young people receiving cash are actually learning anything. Some employers demand kickbacks. The handouts are portrayed as personal gifts from the president.</p><p>His economic record is dismal. Some economists predict real gdp per person will be lower at the end of his term than at the beginning. Mexico should be doing far better. Joe Biden’s stimulus should turbocharge Mexican exports, even as Mexican emigrants send chunks of their stimulus payments back home. The country’s economic sluggishness is the fault of “covid, not our policies”, says Claudia Sheinbaum, the ruling-party mayor of Mexico City. On May 21st Mr López Obrador said he planned to replace the respected central-bank governor with an (unnamed) economist “strongly in favour of moral economics”.</p><p>On a collapsed overpass in Mexico City, someone has scrawled: “Was it worth the bribe?” At least 26 people died when a train fell off it in May. Bystanders speculate that someone took a backhander to ignore shoddy construction or maintenance. “It had cracks. You could see them,” fumes Gabriel Gonzáles, a local taco seller. He complains about rising prices, the baleful effect of covid-19 on his business, and the lack of government support. The president’s party, Morena, “is as bad as the rest of them,” he grumbles.</p><p>The election on June 6th may not deliver as big a blow to the president’s party as it deserves. To oversimplify, it hinges on whether Mr López Obrador’s personal popularity outweighs his woeful record. His approval rating is a healthy 61%, yet polls show most Mexicans are unhappy about the economy, public safety and corruption.</p><p>Morena is less popular than the president. It is ahead of its rivals in the polls, but its lead is slipping. A few months ago its leaders said they expected to win a two-thirds majority of the 500 federal deputies, a dozen of the 15 governor races and the vast majority of the local congresses. Now they are tempering expectations.</p><p>The campaign has been dirty. The opposition say it is no coincidence that, when Morena’s candidate for governor of the rich northern state of Nuevo León flagged in the polls, the attorney-general opened criminal cases against the two leading opposition candidates. More than 30 candidates have been murdered.</p><p>Nonetheless Mr López Obrador is expected to keep control with the help of allied parties (see chart). The opposition—the Institutional Revolutionary Party (pri), which ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, and the National Action Party (pan)—are a mess. Given Mr López Obrador’s record, they should be doing far better. But neither has worked out why the president is so popular. (It is because previous regimes were so self-serving and out of touch.) Neither offers a compelling vision. A newer party, the centre-left Citizens’ Movement (cm), shows more promise. It controls Jalisco and may win Nuevo León; together, these big industrial states generate 15% of gdp.</p><p>Going rogue<br>The opposition’s greatest fear has been that Mr López Obrador might win enough power to change the constitution. For that, he would need two-thirds of both houses of the legislature and a majority of state legislatures. That seems unlikely: he does not have a majority in the upper house, whose seats are not in play in this election. But his critics now worry that if he does badly at the polls, he may double down on extralegal means of transforming the country.</p><p>His party will dominate the poorer states of the south. The opposition will dominate the richer north. More than ever, there will be two Mexicos: one, a dynamic and integrated part of North America; the other, remote, backward and resentful. And one charismatic politician, sure of his own righteousness, will be stirring up rage for at least three more years. </p>]]></content>

We dissect the investment boom"></a>(Finance &amp; economics)—A green bubble? We dissect the investment boom</h1><p>Investors of all stripes are getting on board</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Green assets are on a tear. The prices of battery metals such as lithium and cobalt have surged by about two-thirds and a third, respectively, so far this year. Copper has reached a record, partly owing to its importance for the energy transition; so too has the price of carbon in Europe.</p><p>The surge has extended to the stockmarket, too. Since January 2020 the value of Orsted, a windpower producer, is up by more than a third. The shares of SunRun, a solar firm, have trebled; those of Tesla and Nio, electric-vehicle (ev) makers, have climbed six-fold and nine-fold, respectively. Even lookalikes have gained: Tiziana Life Sciences, a biotech firm with the ticker “tlsa”, benefited from a bump last year when investors mistook it for Tesla (tsla).</p><p>To analyse the boom The Economist has constructed a portfolio of companies that stand to benefit from the energy transition, with a total market capitalisation of $3.7trn. Since the start of 2020 the portfolio, weighted by firms’ market capitalisation, has risen by 59%, twice the increase in the s&amp;p 500, America’s main equity index (see chart 1). Even though the boom has deflated in the past few months, perhaps owing to inflation fears in America, green investing is changing profoundly.</p><p>Green stocks are no longer the preserve of niche sustainable funds. Conventional funds have piled in; stocks are also touted on online forums for day traders, such as WallStreetBets. Many investors draw comparisons between clean energy today and tech at the turn of the millennium—both in terms of the signs of froth, and the emergence of an industry with big structural effects on the economy.</p><p>Gauging the extent of the exuberance is not easy: the stockmarket indices that do exist tend to focus on isolated sectors, such as evs or solar power. So The Economist has looked at the global listed firms that are most held by the biggest 100 or so clean-energy investment funds. Stripping out businesses only loosely related to the energy transition, such as semiconductor-makers, leaves 180-odd firms, ranging from renewable-power producers and ev-makers to energy-efficiency outfits and recyclers.</p><p>Since the start of 2020 our portfolio, when companies are equally weighted, has more than doubled; when firms are weighted by market capitalisation, our portfolio has jumped by more than half. The reason for that difference is that many green firms are small—their median market capitalisation is about $6bn—and the tiddlers have gone up the most. The smallest 25% of the firms have risen by an average of 152% since January 2020. Firms that derive a greater share of their revenue from green activities, such as ev-makers and fuel-cell companies, have also outperformed. The greenest 25% of firms saw their share prices rise by 110%.</p><p>What explains the surge? An obvious explanation is the rise of investing focused on environmental, social and governance (esg) factors. Global flows into esg funds topped $178bn in the first quarter of this year, up from $38bn in the same quarter last year, according to Morningstar, a research firm (see chart 3). esg funds accounted for 24% of total fund inflows so far this year, up from 11% in 2018. On average about two new esg-focused funds are launched each day.</p><p>Many of these are indeed loading up on green stocks. Credit Suisse, a bank, tracked the holdings of 100 esg funds over the past year. Among the five most-purchased companies were Orsted and Vestas Wind, a wind-turbine-maker. Yet only a subset of the funds, accounting for about a tenth of esg assets under management, focused on clean-energy firms. The rest invested more widely. The top 50 holdings of the world’s 20 biggest esg-labelled funds included only two of our green firms. Many of the top ten holdings were in fact tech companies such as Microsoft and Alibaba. (This is partly because fund managers often use esg ratings to gauge if a firm is climate-friendly or socially upstanding, and big companies, with the resources to devote to disclosure, tend to rank more highly.)</p><p>Conventional fund managers, however, are also going green. Morningstar looked at the investors in 30 clean-energy businesses. At the end of 2020, each firm was held by 138 sustainable funds on average, up from 81 a year earlier. The number of non-esg holders also increased, from 390 to 624. Investing in clean energy, says Jessica Alsford of Morgan Stanley, a bank, is “no longer a niche topic”.</p><p>A changing climate<br>The enthusiasm reflects two trends. For a start, many clean-energy firms are now more viable. The prices of some technologies have fallen dramatically, making them competitive with fossil-fuel firms. The cost of solar power has shrunk by around 80% in the past decade. That of lithium-ion batteries, which power evs, is falling by about 20% a year. Moreover, with America, China and the eu setting “net-zero” emissions targets, investors sense that green regulation is here to stay. Pension funds, for example, which hold a lot of oil firms, have started to hedge that risk by buying clean-energy stocks, says Bruce Jenkyn-Jones of Impax, an asset manager.</p><p>The green hype has also been fuelled by financial fads. Retail investing has surged, and punters seem excited about new clean technologies. Among the 20 most popular companies on Robinhood, an app for day traders, are Tesla and Plug Power, a firm that makes hydrogen-fuel cells. Venkatesh Thallam, an independent researcher, notes that a handful of clean-energy firms feature on WallStreetBets. Green special-purpose acquisition vehicles ( spacs), a novel way for companies to list on stockmarkets, have also proliferated. Of the 800-odd spacs that have listed since 2019, about a tenth have focused on sustainability.</p><p>The emergence of meme stocks and spacs raises fears of a green bubble, especially as 30% of firms in our portfolio are loss-making. To gauge the degree of frothiness The Economist has looked at two ratios: price-to-earnings (what the market thinks a company is worth relative to its earnings) and price-to-book (which compares prices to net assets).</p><p>These suggest that the degree of froth varies across green stocks. The median price-to-earnings ratio of renewable-power firms is about that of the s&amp;p 500. By contrast, ev firms have a median price-to-earnings ratio roughly twice that of the wider index. As most hydrogen and fuel-cell firms in our portfolio are not yet making money, price-to-earnings ratios cannot be calculated. But their price-to-book ratio is about 50% above the market average.</p><p>The difference in valuations is explained by variations in the maturity of both the underlying technology and the market. Wind and solar firms began to expand in the 2000s, aided by generous government subsidies. Over time the technologies improved and the subsidies shrank. The sectors also consolidated; those that survived now generate stable revenues.</p><p>By contrast, the frothier stocks are where wind and solar was a decade ago. The technology is often unproven, or the products need subsidies to be viable. And there are lots of firms competing with each other. The allure for investors is that one of them might be the next Tesla.</p><p>A few things could sap that exuberance. Inflation is a worry. Stock prices have already fallen this year upon inflation scares in America. Many green firms’ valuations are based on earnings far into the future. Higher inflation would erode that. If central banks raise interest rates, that could hurt renewable-power producers, which rely on debt for most of their financing.</p><p>Investors’ enthusiasm could also wane if some of the more speculative technologies fail. The froth has already attracted short-sellers. Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg Research, an investment firm, says fraud has become “pervasive” as money has flowed into green firms. Bosses might promise more than they can deliver or exaggerate the prowess of their technology. Hindenburg claims a string of esg superstars have misled investors. That includes Ormat, a geothermal-power producer, and Nikola, an ev-maker. Ormat has said the claims are “inaccurate”, and Nikola has called them “false and defamatory”.</p><p>If technologies do succeed, fat returns may still not follow: falling product prices might offset demand growth. That was the case during the solar boom, says Velislava Dimitrova of Fidelity, another asset manager. Solar installations grew by 670% over the past decade, but module prices fell by over 85%. As a result, cumulative revenue growth for the industry was roughly 15%.</p><p>Still, many investors are optimistic. Few think that the energy transition will go into reverse. They argue that the prospects for the sector as a whole are promising, even if some firms end up being duds. Comparisons to the tech industry at the turn of the century abound. Like the internet, decarbonisation will lead to structural change in the global economy. Capital will have to flow towards cleaner technologies. The process will create winners and losers.</p><p>Mark Lacey of Schroders, an asset manager, notes that in the three years after 2000, many small and mid-cap tech companies went bust. Lots of green firms could meet the same fate. But it is worth remembering that, two decades after the dotcom bust, tech firms make up 38% of the market capitalisation of the s&amp;p 500. </p><p><a id="the-global-chip-shortage-is-here-for-some-time"></a></p><h1 id="The-global-chip-shortage-is-here-for-some-time"><a href="#The-global-chip-shortage-is-here-for-some-time" class="headerlink" title="The global chip shortage is here for some time"></a>The global chip shortage is here for some time</h1><p>Microchips were a boom-and-bust industry even before covid-19</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>For want of a chip, the factory was lost. On May 18th Toyota became the latest carmaker forced to cut production amid a global shortage of microchips, announcing it would suspend work at two of its plants in Japan. Firms including Ford, General Motors and Jaguar Land Rover have also had to send workers home.</p><p>The pain is not confined to the car industry, for the shortage spans all sorts of chips, from the expensive, high-tech devices that power smartphones and data centres to the simple sensors and microcontrollers that have become a vital commodity, scattered across everything from cars to washing machines, and often costing just a few cents each. In the past few weeks companies including Foxconn, Nintendo and Samsung have warned of hits to production, affecting everything from smartphones and games consoles to televisions and home broadband routers.</p><p>Governments are worried. America’s called a summit in April; another is due on May 20th. Germany’s finance minister has written to the government of Taiwan, where many chipmakers are based, lobbying for priority for carmakers. A report from Gavekal Research, a consultancy, published on May 4th, said the shortage might soon hit export performance in several East Asian economies. But there is little that ministers can do. The chip drought is the result of the covid-19 pandemic interacting with an industry that is notoriously prone to cycles of boom and bust. It is likely to persist for months, if not years.</p><p>“The most important thing [to recognise]”, says Malcolm Penn, who runs Future Horizons, a chip-industry consultancy, “is that shortages are a natural part of the industry.” Chipmaking, he says, is a good example of what economists call a “pork-cycle” business, named for the regular swings between under- and over-supply first analysed in American pork markets in the 1920s. As with pigs, the supply of chips cannot quickly react to changes in demand. Capacity was tight even before the pandemic, says Mr Penn, pointing out that investment by chipmakers in factory equipment has been below its long-term average for many years (see chart).</p><p>The pandemic thus arrived at the worst possible time. After an early crash, demand in several segments boomed, says Alan Priestley of Gartner, another consultancy. Locked-down consumers bought laptops and other gadgets. Cloud-computing operators, which are big consumers of high-end chips, scrambled to add servers to deal with the wave of home-workers. The car industry was particularly badly hit by a decision to cut orders early in the pandemic. Demand for cars has since recovered. But the complexities of the production process means it takes three to four months to turn a blank silicon wafer into a usable batch of chips. “I can cancel my orders in an afternoon,” says Mr Penn. “If I want to start them up again, that takes months—and anyway, that capacity is now busy serving other customers.”</p><p>The impact of the pandemic, in turn, has been made worse by industry-specific problems. In March a chip plant owned by Renesas, a Japanese firm, caught fire, piling pain on the car industry. Some chipmakers, meanwhile, face shortages of their own. Many cheap, workaday parts are made in older factories designed to process silicon wafers that are 200mm in diameter, or even smaller. (These days 300mm is the standard.) Efforts to boost capacity are stymied by the fact that few toolmakers still make the old-style machines, says Mr Priestley. The market for second-hand 200mm tools, meanwhile, has been stripped bare.</p><p>But the pork cycle is turning once again. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, plans to spend $30bn on new capacity this year alone. Samsung Electronics and Intel, two other giants, have pencilled in $28bn and $20bn respectively; second-tier chipmakers are ramping up spending too. That will bring relief to the wider economy, says Mr Priestley, but not immediately. On May 14th Jim Whitehurst, the boss of ibm, a computer-maker, said he thought the shortages might last for two years. And, says Mr Penn, when the drought eventually ends, chipmakers may find they face a familiar problem, but on a bigger scale: a capacity splurge in response to serious shortages today could well mean a sizeable glut tomorrow. </p><p><a id="as-bitcoin-lurches-wall-street-plots-its-way-into-cryptoland"></a></p><h1 id="As-bitcoin-lurches-Wall-Street-plots-its-way-into-cryptoland"><a href="#As-bitcoin-lurches-Wall-Street-plots-its-way-into-cryptoland" class="headerlink" title="As bitcoin lurches, Wall Street plots its way into cryptoland"></a>As bitcoin lurches, Wall Street plots its way into cryptoland</h1><p>To work out the fate of crypto-investing, watch what the banks do next</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Crypto buffs have had a punishing week. On May 13th Tether, which issues a “stablecoin” widely used to facilitate bitcoin trading, said that just 2.9% of its $58bn-worth of coins is backed by cash reserves, feeding doubts about its dollar peg. Elon Musk, Tesla’s boss, tweeted that the electric-car maker would not after all accept payments in bitcoin. Then on May 18th China warned financial firms against servicing cryptocurrencies. The price of bitcoin tumbled to $30,000, less than half its record high in April, before stabilising at around $39,000.</p><p>As it cratered, bitcoin dragged most other cryptocurrencies with it. Several big crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, experienced lengthy outages. Investors unable to liquidate positions felt trapped; those willing to “buy the dip” felt cheated. The latest swing might raise doubts about whether crypto markets are liquid or even reliable enough to welcome institutional investors en masse. That is why it is worth looking to Wall Street.</p><p>America’s big banks have been venturing into cryptoland. In March Morgan Stanley became the first to offer wealthy customers access to bitcoin funds. This month Goldman Sachs revived the crypto desk it had mothballed in 2017; Citigroup said it may offer crypto services. bny Mellon and State Street are vying to administer bitcoin exchange-traded funds, currently under regulatory review in America. JPMorgan Chase, once adamant that it would steer clear unless cryptocurrencies began to be regulated, has hinted that it might start trading operations if the market expands.</p><p>Why are highly regulated banks wandering into the unregulated wilderness of crypto? It helps that watchdogs in America have been setting out what services banks can provide. Last year the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they could offer custodial services for crypto assets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regards bitcoin and other digital currencies as commodities, enabling banks to trade derivatives linked to them.</p><p>The main reason for banks’ enthusiasm, though, is obsessive interest from some customers. A year ago Itay Tuchman, Citigroup’s foreign-exchange chief, hardly ever fielded calls on crypto from institutional clients. Now he receives them several times a week, he says. Roman Regelman of bny Mellon deems the craze “an opportunity, but also an imperative”. Wealthy clients are pulling money out of private banks, and retail punters out of current accounts, to bet on digital currencies through fintech firms and startups. Many would rather do everything with their banks, which, in turn, hope to reap the rewards in customer fees and data.</p><p>Perhaps the easiest service to offer is derivatives trading, as Goldman now does, providing clients with exposure to the assets without having to buy them. Then comes custody: the storage, and related book-keeping, of assets on behalf of big investors. This requires investing in technology; the few banks already selling custody subcontract tasks to specialist firms.</p><p>But it is the next level of services, where banks hold digital assets on their balance-sheets, either as collateral or by trading in spot markets, that is currently beyond reach. After a day like May 19th, when bitcoin lost nearly a third of its value in a few hours, regulators may ensure it stays that way. Even if banks do not trade directly, says Chris Zuehlke of Cumberland, a Chicago-based firm that helped Goldman execute its first big “block” trade of crypto futures on May 6th, they could still connect clients to large spot traders, acting as the shopfront but relying on the infrastructure, and balance-sheets, of others.</p><p>Banks insist that most clients expect a rollercoaster ride. But a prolonged rout could still scare off prospective converts and trigger a regulatory crackdown. Wall Street has an unrivalled ability to bring liquidity and distribution muscle to new assets. Anyone wanting to work out the fate of crypto-investing might do well to see what the banks do next. </p><p><a id="how-to-gauge-investors%E2%80%99-fear-of-inflation"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-gauge-investors’-fear-of-inflation"><a href="#How-to-gauge-investors’-fear-of-inflation" class="headerlink" title="How to gauge investors’ fear of inflation"></a>How to gauge investors’ fear of inflation</h1><p>Forget VIX. The MOVE index tracks bond-market terror</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>What do investors fear most? In the Bank of America’s long-running survey of fund managers, the tail risk that has mostly preoccupied them until recently has been the pandemic. In this month’s survey, though, inflation rose to the top of the list of worries. It is not hard to see why. High inflation, if sustained, would require central banks to act decisively to contain it. That would mean the end of the low interest rates that have underpinned the prices of an array of expensive-looking assets, from stocks and bonds to property.</p><p>Surveys are one thing. The bets investors make are another. The vix, or volatility index, is the best-known market gauge of fear. It tracks the cost of insuring against extreme moves in American share prices and is widely used by banks and asset managers as a guide to managing risk in general. Yet the vix does not get directly to what presently worries investors. For that, you need to consult a less-celebrated oracle—the move, or Merrill Lynch Options Volatility Estimate, a market-based measure of uncertainty about interest rates. It has the stronger claim to being the true fear index. If it spikes it means bond investors have been gripped by raw terror.</p><p>The outlook for inflation is unclear. On the one hand, the form book says there is no reason to worry. For much of the past decade and more, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have consistently over-forecast inflation and under-shot their inflation targets. Jumps in inflation, such as the one recorded last month as America’s economy reopened in earnest, have usually proved transitory. On the other hand, present conditions seem fertile for inflation. The pressure on aggregate demand is fuelled not only by loose monetary policy but by hefty fiscal stimulus. In the face of this more insistent spending, businesses’ rules of thumb about which kind of workers to hire, how much to pay and how quickly to add capacity may prove faulty. Inflation might upset the form book.</p><p>If inflation is uncertain, so is the path for interest rates. Forecasts of monetary policy are reflected in the slope of the bond-yield curve and in interest-rate futures. The range of uncertainty around these expectations is embedded in options prices. A financial option is the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on or before a specified maturity date. Options are particularly valuable—and expensive—when investors are more uncertain or more fearful about the future. The level of market anxiety or uncertainty can thus be extracted from their prices. These are the raw material for the move index, which is derived from options on two-, five-, ten- and thirty-year Treasuries.</p><p>The move is expressed in basis points, explains Harley Bassman, who invented the index. If, say, interest rates are 5% and the move is 100, it means that most (68%, or one standard deviation of a normal distribution) of the time interest rates are expected to lie between 4% and 6%. At present the index is in the fifties, which is low relative to its history and much lower than at times of extreme market stress (see chart). This is partly technical, says Mr Bassman. With interest rates not far from zero and the Fed seemingly disinclined to ever take them negative, the scope for volatility in Treasuries is somewhat curtailed. Another explanation is that people believe the Fed when it says it will not change its monetary-policy settings for a while. That expectation lowers the implied volatility on two-year Treasuries, which drags on the overall move index.</p><p>Even so, the move seems very likely to rise again—and perhaps sharply. The Fed will get beyond the sitting-on-hands phase. The market is betting that interest rates will rise in early 2023, after the Fed has first announced and then completed a tapering of its bond purchases. How far the move will eventually move will depend on how transitory inflation looks to the bond markets and how in control of the situation the Fed seems. Many already swear by the index. A sharp rise in it is often a cue for panicky sales of the riskier sort of assets and a general repricing of individual securities, says Kevin Russell of ubs O’Connor, the hedge-fund unit of the Swiss asset manager. That is because if investors grow less certain about interest rates, they also lose confidence about where value is in the credit or equity markets.</p><p>For the rest of us, the move is the best proxy for something that matters a lot given the growing fears of inflation. The advantage of a single-number gauge is simplicity. And the move is now the one to watch.</p><p><a id="learning-to-live-without-libor"></a></p><h1 id="Learning-to-live-without-LIBOR"><a href="#Learning-to-live-without-LIBOR" class="headerlink" title="Learning to live without LIBOR"></a>Learning to live without LIBOR</h1><p>The benchmark will be replaced by a panoply of measures. That is no bad thing</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Arestaurant chain in Huntsville, Alabama, draws an extra few thousand dollars from its working-capital facility with a local bank. Meanwhile, its employees’ pension scheme needs to convert the variable interest rate on $10bn of its assets into a fixed revenue stream. The scheme agrees to an interest-rate swap with a hedge fund, which wants to bet on the Federal Reserve raising rates. It places the wager using a margin loan from its prime broker, one of Wall Street’s larger banks.</p><p>Each transaction needs a benchmark to decide what interest rate should be charged. The bizarre thing is that they all use the same one: the London interbank offered rate (libor), an estimate of the rate at which big banks in London lend to each other in an obscure corner of the money markets. Every day, it gives borrowing costs for each of five currencies, for periods ranging from overnight to a year. Those for the dollar alone are used to determine the interest rates on $223trn of debt and derivatives—more than two-and-a-half times annual global gdp. But the benchmark is not long for this world. Fixings for the euro, sterling, Swiss franc and yen will be discontinued at the end of 2021, and those for the dollar in June 2023. What will replace them?</p><p>libor is best known for a scandal that broke in 2012, when it emerged that banks and traders had been illicitly manipulating it for years. That had become even easier after the market it was meant to measure all but evaporated. For most of the five decades since its invention, banks used unsecured loans from their peers as a source of day-to-day funding. But these dried up during the financial crisis of 2007-09 and never returned to anything like their previous volume. An interbank lending market with daily transactions of around $500m now underpins contracts pegged to dollar libor that are worth about 450,000 times that. This disparity led regulators to call time on libor in 2017.</p><p>The most striking feature of the transition is the diversity of the candidates to replace it. Start with the leading alternatives in each of libor’s five currencies. Those are the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) for the dollar, the sterling overnight index average (sonia) for the pound, the Tokyo overnight average rate (tonar) for the yen, the Swiss average rate overnight (saron) for the Swiss franc, and the euro short-term rate (€str) for the euro. All are so-called “near-risk-free” rates, which measure the cost of overnight lending. But they do this in different ways, which reflect local funding conditions. British, European and Japanese banks lean on unsecured deposits for their day-to-day liquidity. So sonia, €str and tonar are daily averages of the rates banks pay on such deposits. But big American and Swiss banks tend to rely more on repos (secured loans collateralised by government bonds). So sofr and saron measure transactions in these markets instead.</p><p>Further fragmentation is emerging within the dollar market. sofr is less useful for the regional bank in Alabama that lends to local businesses, since it is unlikely to be a heavy user of repos. Such lenders tend to be more reliant on short-term, unsecured debt not dissimilar to that underpinning libor, albeit at rates set for small banks in the local market rather than big ones in London. Hence the creation of ameribor, an index that measures borrowing costs of small, medium and regional banks in America. Two indices produced by Bloomberg, a financial-data firm, and by the Intercontinental Exchange (ice), aim to perform a similar function for larger banks that derive some of their funding from long-dated bonds rather than short-term repos, and that wish to lend using a benchmark that reflects their normal borrowing costs.</p><p>These alternatives to sofr may be better tailored to certain types of lenders, but they come with two drawbacks. The first is that they might be too libor-like. Thomas Wipf of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (arrc), a body convened by the Federal Reserve to steer the dollar market’s transition, warns against relying on reference rates that may share libor’s shortcomings. A bespoke index representing banks’ funding costs may seem like a fine idea, until a liquidity crunch hits and the transactions underpinning it dry up, making it unstable in times of stress. sofr, which is based on over $1trn of daily repo transactions, was chosen by the arrc to avoid precisely this eventuality. By contrast, ameribor and ice’s Bank Yield Index are underpinned by transactions worth $2.5bn and $15bn respectively.</p><p>The second concern is liquidity, and hence trading costs, in the markets indexed to the more tailored benchmarks. Under libor—and, in the future, sofr—the restaurant chain in Huntsville has access to the same derivative market as the hedge fund. That vast trading pool means that small businesses can buy contracts to protect themselves from rising interest rates relatively cheaply. ameribor might hew more closely to the regional lender’s funding costs, but trading debt and derivatives linked to this niche yardstick is likely to be slower and more expensive.</p><p>These flaws could mean that some of the new benchmarks fall into disuse. Yet, on balance, the constellation of successors to libor seems like a good thing. It is fundamental to the concept of debt that borrowing costs depend on who you are, who your lender is and which currency you borrow in. The new measures should do a better job than a relic with little relevance for today’s financial system. </p><p><a id="how-covid-19-could-impede-the-catch-up-of-poor-countries-with-rich-ones"></a></p><h1 id="How-covid-19-could-impede-the-catch-up-of-poor-countries-with-rich-ones"><a href="#How-covid-19-could-impede-the-catch-up-of-poor-countries-with-rich-ones" class="headerlink" title="How covid-19 could impede the catch-up of poor countries with rich ones"></a>How covid-19 could impede the catch-up of poor countries with rich ones</h1><p>Even before the pandemic, it would have taken 170 years to halve the income gap</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It once seemed possible that covid-19 might deliver a softer blow to poor economies than rich ones. Instead, the virus seems likely to set the emerging world back in its quest to attain advanced-economy incomes. Real gdp per person in America shrank by about 4% in 2020, only about half a percentage point more than the average across emerging markets, in purchasing-power-parity terms. But projections made by the imf in April suggest that American growth is set to outpace that in the emerging world this year; with the pandemic still ravaging places like Brazil and India, poor-country growth will probably lag even further behind. More worrying still, the pandemic may reshape the global economy in ways that make continued convergence towards rich-world incomes a tougher slog. Worse prospects for poor countries will in turn make managing future crises, from pandemics to climate change, harder. The rich world should take note.</p><p>Economists once reckoned that incomes in poorer economies should naturally catch up to those in richer ones, based on experience in Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when industrial laggards caught up to (and frequently overtook) Britain. Backward countries could borrow the latest know-how from leading ones, the thinking went, and their limited capital base promised hefty returns to investors. In the 1950s two economists, Robert Solow and Trevor Swan, separately developed models of economic growth in which higher returns to capital in poorer countries than in rich ones lead to more investment, generating faster growth and convergence. As scholars gathered more data on more countries, however, it became clear that the 20th century was not a period of convergence, but rather of “divergence, big time”, in the words of Lant Pritchett of Oxford University.</p><p>Then, just as economists had all but given up on the idea of convergence, poorer countries began outgrowing rich ones in an extraordinary way. Between 1985 and 1995 incomes per person in the emerging world fell behind those in rich countries at a rate of 0.5% per year, according to a new paper by Michael Kremer of the University of Chicago, Jack Willis of Columbia University and Yang You of the University of Hong Kong. But from 2005 to 2015, incomes converged at a rate of 0.7% per year. Slower growth in the rich world aided the shift, but more important was a broad acceleration in poor-country growth. Crucially, the share of developing economies experiencing disastrous downturns shrank dramatically, according to recent work by Dev Patel of Harvard University, and Justin Sandefur and Arvind Subramanian of the Centre for Global Development. Average annual growth rates were negative in 42% of low-income countries in the 1980s, compared with only 16% in the 2000s and 2010s.</p><p>This turn in fortunes had enormous consequences for matters from global poverty, which has tumbled over the past generation, to geopolitics. Yet economists are not certain why growth suddenly took off, and thus struggle to assess how likely convergence is to continue. Even before the pandemic there were puzzling trends. Low-income countries outgrew high-income ones by 1.5 percentage points a year in the 2000s (and middle-income countries did better still) but the gap shrank to just 0.65 percentage points in the 2010s. Convergence also became less widespread, geographically, as the 2010s wore on. While incomes in Asian and European emerging economies continued to gain on those in America, Latin America, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa began to fall further behind around 2013.</p><p>The decline in real output per person in 2020 erased roughly a decade’s worth of income gains in those lagging regions. Some countries might quickly recover those losses, though plodding vaccinations and continued outbreaks complicate matters. Rising commodity prices could boost the fortunes of exporters of natural resources, while the migration of more services online after covid-19 could open up opportunities for trade. In some ways developing countries have also become more economically resilient. Mr Kremer and his co-authors examine 32 indicators of the quality of governance, macroeconomic policy and financial development, and find that, for 29 of them, performance improved more in poorer countries than in rich ones between 1985 and 2015. Convergence also took place across measures of culture, such as survey-based attitudes towards inequality and work. Having become more like rich countries, poor places may find it easier than in the past to maintain stable growth, as rich economies tend to.</p><p>Yet other factors that buoyed growth in the 2000s and 2010s—such as rapid Chinese development and the explosion in trade associated with the spread of global supply chains—cannot easily be repeated. Rich-world worries about supply-chain reliability, exacerbated by the logistical bottlenecks now besetting the global economy, could in fact bring some trade retrenchment. Perhaps most worrying is the possibility that the trauma of the pandemic could fan political and social instability, particularly in lagging regions, undermining the basis for stable growth.</p><p>Closing arguments<br>Poor countries can scarcely afford such setbacks. Even at the pace of catch-up of the past two decades it would take the average developing economy about 170 years to close half its income gap, say Mr Patel and co-authors. Recent growth has not much reduced the poor world’s dependence on rich-world benevolence, as a yawning gap in vaccination rates demonstrates. And the costs of climate change only loom.</p><p>Rapid growth earlier in this century encouraged rich-world governments to see developing countries more as lucrative markets or strategic rivals than charity cases. But poor places remain more vulnerable to crises. And with every crisis, attaining stable growth becomes even harder. Rich-world policy on matters from trade to aid must take this into account. ■</p><p><a id="science--technology---rna-good-for-vaccines-can-also-be-used-as-a-pesticide"></a></p><h1 id="Science-amp-technology-—RNA-good-for-vaccines-can-also-be-used-as-a-pesticide"><a href="#Science-amp-technology-—RNA-good-for-vaccines-can-also-be-used-as-a-pesticide" class="headerlink" title="(Science &amp; technology)—RNA, good for vaccines, can also be used as a pesticide"></a>(Science &amp; technology)—RNA, good for vaccines, can also be used as a pesticide</h1><p>A new approach to debugging</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Ribonucleic acid (rna), once little-known outside biological circles, has recently become the molecule de nos jours. The reason is its role in covid-19 vaccines. The rna molecules in these encode spike, a coronavirus protein. So, when the protein-making machinery of a body cell encounters such rna, spike is what it makes. That lets a vaccine-recipient’s immune system learn to recognise a crucial part of the enemy before the real thing turns up.</p><p>Helping to make proteins is not, however, rna’s only job. Among many other things it is central to a process called rna interference, which prevents, rather than facilitates, the manufacture of specific proteins. rnai, as this activity is called for short, has also been investigated medically. It has been approved for use against four genetic diseases and is under investigation for the treatment of more than a dozen others. That is good. Some biologists, though, think rnai may have an important non-medical use as well, as a precisely targeted, environmentally friendly pesticide.</p><p>The theory is simple. Identify a protein crucial to the survival of the pest in question. Tailor a specific interfering rna molecule to sabotage production of that protein. Deliver it into the bodies of the pests. Then wait for them all to die. In practice, of course, things are more complicated. Delivery mechanisms have to be designed and regulatory hoops jumped through. But until recently, the biggest obstacle was cost. Life-saving medicines can be expensive. Pesticides must be cheap. One effect of all the medical rna work, however, has been to bring down the cost of making the stuff. As Michael Helmstetter, the boss of rnaissance Ag, a firm in Kansas which is developing rna-based pesticides, observes, “a gram of rna cost $100,000 when we started. By 2014 it was $100 a gram. Now it’s a dollar a gram.”</p><p>Running interference<br>Top of the list of potential beneficiaries are honeybees. These semi-domesticated insects, important not only for their eponymous product, but also as pollinators, are plagued by Varroa destructor, a mite a couple of millimetres across (pictured above, on the head of a pupating bee). Varroa mites live by attaching themselves to, and feeding on, bees. This weakens or kills the hosts and also spreads viruses around a hive. Some suspect Varroa plays a role in colony-collapse disorder, a mysterious phenomenon in which most of a hive’s workers desert for no apparent reason.</p><p>Beekeepers have tried all sorts of ways of attacking Varroa mites. Some place plastic strips laced with amitraz, a pesticide reckoned particularly effective against mites, at the entrances to hives. Others vaporise oxalic acid, which has a similar reputation, and pump it into the hive. Others still run breeding programmes, selecting for bees that resist infestation. None has succeeded in solving the Varroa problem. At best, these approaches keep the mites’ numbers just below the threshold of crisis.</p><p>GreenLight Biosciences, a company in Boston, wants to help. It has bought from Bayer, a German pharmaceutical and life-science firm, the rights to an experimental Varroa pesticide based on rnai. Andrey Zarur, GreenLight’s boss, hopes this will succeed where other methods fail because it attacks the mite in a way mere chemical interventions cannot.</p><p>Varroa’s lifecycle starts when a pregnant female mite crawls alongside a bee larva developing inside one of the nursery cells in a hive’s honeycomb. While the larva is growing, this mite just sits there. But once it turns into a pupa she springs into action and lays her eggs on it. Mites and bee then mature in unison over the next few days, and when the adult bee emerges from the cell, the mites attached to it spread around the hive to repeat their trick with future generations.</p><p>That the mites spend so much time hidden in the honeycomb makes them hard to attack. And this is where GreenLight hopes its rna will win through. In field trials in the state of Georgia the firm’s operatives are feeding Varroa-destroying rna to the bees themselves—mixing it in sugar water which the workers drink and make honey from. This lays a biotechnological trap for the mites by lacing any honey in their birthplace with the stuff. By lowering the cost of rna production and so allowing much more of it to be used, Mr Zarur thinks he can deliver more rna to the mites, succeeding where Bayer and others did not.</p><p>Varroa mites are not, though, the only pests in GreenLight’s crosshairs. It also has its sights trained on Colorado potato beetles, which can devastate crops if not controlled. In their case the rna is simply sprayed onto an infested field and the beetles munch it up. And, though it is cagey about the details, the firm says it has 13 other hostile organisms under investigation, too. These include the fall armyworm, a moth caterpillar that chomps through everything from tobacco to oranges, and the caterpillars of the diamondback moth, the world’s worst pest of brassicas, a group which includes cabbages, cauliflowers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and oilseed rape. Nor is the rnai approach limited to attacking animals. In principle, any organism is susceptible to it. GreenLight’s target list therefore also includes crop-damaging fungi such as Botrytis, Fusarium and powdery mildew.</p><p>Cell game<br>Not surprisingly, GreenLight has rivals in its quest to develop RNA pesticides. At least two other American companies are working on them as well. AgroSpheres, in Charlottesville, Virginia, is going after diamondback moths. RNAissance Ag, Dr Helmstetter’s firm, is gunning for them too, and also the fall armyworm. All three enterprises think they can make RNA cheaply enough for it to be sprayed onto fields. But they do so in different ways.</p><p>GreenLight employs a process called cell-free biology, which is more akin to chemistry than conventional biotechnology. Eliminating the need to coddle fussy micro-organisms, says Mr Zarur, simplifies and cheapens things dramatically. But the more traditional approach taken by rnaissance and AgroSpheres, of growing their rna molecules inside modified bacteria, offers advantages, too. Packaging the rna in bacterial cells in this way protects the molecules. It also allows the companies’ biotechnologists to add features to the cell walls, such as stickiness that stops them slipping off the leaves of plants.</p><p>Spraying rna onto crops is not, however, the only way to get it into pests. Though it has abandoned its honeybee technology, Bayer is developing a genetically modified maize which produces rna that kills beetle larvae called corn rootworms. A group at the University of Florida is taking a similar approach to the insects known as psyllids that spread a bacterium which causes citrus-greening disease, a serious threat to orange groves.</p><p>rna spraying has advantages, though. A farmer can use it on existing crops, rather than having to replant with transgenic versions. The regulations are less onerous than for the creation of transgenic organisms. And in Europe, where transgenic crops are banned in many places, governments seem open to rna-based pesticides.</p><p>Andreas Vilcinskas, an entomologist at the Fraunhofer Institute’s campus in Giessen, Germany, who is working with GreenLight, says the German government now supports their development. It has good reason to. In 2018 the European Union banned the outdoor use of three types of neonicotinoids, a popular class of pesticides. Since then, Germany, France and Poland have all had to reverse this ban on an emergency basis after aphids spread like wildfire. Ironically, neonicotinoids were banned to help bees. Promoting rna as a pesticide might thus, as it were, kill many bugs with one stone. </p><p><a id="how-to-save-the-world%E2%80%99s-orange-groves"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-save-the-world’s-orange-groves"><a href="#How-to-save-the-world’s-orange-groves" class="headerlink" title="How to save the world’s orange groves"></a>How to save the world’s orange groves</h1><p>A bacterium threatens them. RNA may be their saviour</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Citrus-greening disease is a bacterial infection of citrus-fruit trees, spread by insects called psyllids. It was first recorded a century ago, in China, and it has since spread widely. It can be extremely harmful. Within a decade of its arrival in Florida, for example, it had wreaked $4.6bn-worth of damage and reduced yields by 74%. If its spread continues, says Georgios Vidalakis of the University of California, Riverside, who directs California’s Citrus Clonal Protection Programme, citrus fruits risk becoming niche products.</p><p>The problem is less the bacteria than the host plant’s reaction to them. They are injected when the insects feed on sap-carrying phloem tissues—the parts of a plant’s internal plumbing responsible for transporting sugar around. To stop the bacteria spreading, the plant mounts an immune response which thickens the walls of phloem cells with callose, a polymer made of sugar molecules. In the case of citrus-greening disease this response is overenthusiastic, and the phloem tubes get blocked.</p><p>Attempts to control the psyllids have proved futile. Nor is any way known to halt or reverse infections. Anne Simon of the University of Maryland, though, thinks she may have an answer. Her approach is based on a discovery made by Dr Vidalakis and his team in 2013. This is that a harmless discolouration sometimes seen in the veins of citrus trees is caused by molecules of so-called independently mobile infectious rna (irna). irnas are about the simplest self-reproducing structures imaginable. Though virus-like, they have no proteins of their own. Instead, they encode an enzyme called rna-dependent rna polymerase, which then churns out copies of the rna they are composed of.</p><p>They do, however, need to be able to move from cell to cell in order to spread. To that end, they disguise themselves with plant proteins that let them pass through the passages connecting neighbouring cells. Dr Simon wondered if that mobility might be exploited to carry other molecules around as well. In particular, she has in mind to yoke the irna in question to a specially designed string of rna that would interfere either with the manufacture of the pathogen’s proteins or with proteins involved in manufacturing callose.</p><p>To develop this idea commercially, she has started a firm called Silvec Biologics. Should it prove successful, which will probably take a decade to determine, she thinks other trees will benefit too. The irnas seem capable of tunnelling between cells in trees of all kinds, so they could one day be used to protect woody plants with similar problems, including grape vines, olives and cacao.</p><p><a id="how-to-get-all-the-toothpaste-out-of-the-tube"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-get-all-the-toothpaste-out-of-the-tube"><a href="#How-to-get-all-the-toothpaste-out-of-the-tube" class="headerlink" title="How to get all the toothpaste out of the tube"></a>How to get all the toothpaste out of the tube</h1><p>With a super-slippery surface</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Agnarled toothpaste tube, squeezed and twisted out of shape in a vain attempt to extract its remaining contents, haunts many a bathroom. But not, perhaps, for much longer. Colgate-Palmolive, an American consumer-goods giant, has taken up an invention by a pair of experts in super-slippery surfaces to produce toothpaste tubes that promise to deliver every last scrap of their contents.</p><p>In 2012 Kripa Varanasi, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dave Smith, his phd student, set up a company called LiquiGlide to commercialise their work on making liquids flow more easily through pipes and out of containers. What caught many people’s imaginations at the time was a demonstration of how this could be used to empty a ketchup bottle without shaking it vigorously.</p><p>So far, ketchup-makers have not embraced the idea. But the health and beauty industry, where products tend to be pricier than ketchup, is interested. Mibelle Group, a Swiss producer of health-care and beauty products, employs the technology to lessen the amount of material left stuck to the insides of pipes and vessels in its factories when it is time for a clean-up. LiquiGlide’s deal with Colgate is, though, the firm’s first big break into a consumer business.</p><p>The new toothpaste, called Elixir, comes in three varieties: a formula for whitening teeth, one for gum and enamel care and a “detox” version which, it is claimed, removes impurities from the mouth. All are packaged in plastic tubes that can be emptied with ease. Elixir has gone on sale in Europe, though no decision has yet been made about whether it will be sold elsewhere.</p><p>To produce their slippery pipes and containers, Dr Varanasi and Dr Smith first impose a microscopically textured pattern on them and then apply a suitably formulated liquid. This fills the gaps in the texture, creating a surface across which gooey substances slide easily. Any risk of contamination can be eliminated by making the liquid in question from materials also employed in the product.</p><p>Besides pleasing customers who like to get their money’s worth, the new, slippery toothpaste tubes should help with recycling. Existing tubes are rarely recycled, not only because they have residue left inside them but also because they are usually made from a laminate of plastic and aluminium foil. Mixed materials of this sort are hard to recycle, and therefore end up being dumped in landfill, or incinerated.</p><p>Despite their success with toothpaste, Dr Varanasi and Dr Smith have not given up on food producers. Besides ketchup, their slippery surfaces also aid the dispensing of products such as mayonnaise, and may help, too, with things like hummus and soured cream that have a thicker consistency and which usually come in tubs. They have, for instance, carried out a trial putting cream cheese into a squeezy bottle with a slot-shaped dispenser. “You get this perfect strip of cream cheese right on your bagel,” enthuses Dr Smith. </p><p><a id="anal-oxygen-administration-may-save-lives"></a></p><h1 id="Anal-oxygen-administration-may-save-lives"><a href="#Anal-oxygen-administration-may-save-lives" class="headerlink" title="Anal oxygen administration may save lives"></a>Anal oxygen administration may save lives</h1><p>Inspired by fish, researchers are planning oxygen enemas</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Fish breathe through their gills.

And this is precisely what happens in species such as the weather loach (pictured).</p><p>As far as is known, no land vertebrate can perform this trick. But, in a paper just published in Med, Takebe Takanori of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, in Ohio, describes how terrestrial animals might, with a bit of assistance, be enabled to do so. So far, Dr Takebe and his colleagues have turned mice, rats and pigs into bottom-breathers. If they can extend the trick to people, it could offer an alternative to tracheal intubation as a means of keeping those with breathing difficulties alive.</p><p>The notion that intestinal oxygen might be medically beneficial surfaced briefly in the mid-20th century, though experimental evidence swiftly crushed it. But Dr Takebe observed that the experiments in question had failed to consider a crucial fact. Mammalian rectums are lined with layers of mucous which could limit the exchange of gases. To test the intestinal-breathing hypothesis properly, this mucous would need to be removed, to grant oxygen direct access to the intestines’ wall.</p><p>To begin with, Dr Takebe and his colleagues tried this with mice. After anaesthetising their subjects, they scraped away the mucous linings using toothpicks. They then fitted the animals with masks, to restrict their air supply, and pumped oxygen into their intestines. Control mice, masked but not so perfused, survived for less than quarter of an hour. Those receiving rectal oxygen lasted 50 minutes.</p><p>Buoyed by this result, the team sought a less traumatic means of delivering the gas. They settled on perfluorocarbons. These are liquids that can absorb large amounts of oxygen. They are often used as a blood substitute, or to assist the ventilation of premature babies. The quantity of oxygen they can carry, combined with the extra pressure a liquid applies to the intestinal lining, means scraping away the mucous is no longer necessary.</p><p>After administering oxygenated perfluorocarbon enemas to anaesthetised mice with intact rectal linings, the researchers put them in chambers with a restricted oxygen supply, to see what would happen. They found that mice dosed with perfluorocarbons retained high levels of oxygen in their blood for over an hour—more than four times longer than control animals not so treated. What is more, says Dr Takebe, the rodents’ subsequent behaviour did not seem to be affected by the time they had spent in low-oxygen conditions.</p><p>Following the success of these experiments, the researchers moved on to rats and pigs, and found that the technique worked with them, too. In light of this Dr Takebe hopes to start trials on healthy human volunteers next year.</p><p>Though Dr Takebe began this project before the appearance of covid-19, the pandemic has thrown into sharp relief the need for better means of medical ventilation. And, while rectal ventilation sounds uncomfortable, it might actually be easier on the body than the traumatic process of intubation. Whether perfluorocarbon enemas would deliver enough oxygen, and whether the weakened bodies of patients with respiratory failure could absorb it, remains to be seen. But in the face of a ventilation crisis, as John Hurst, a respiratory specialist at University College, London, puts it, “anything that is innovative is immediately attractive as a solution.” </p><p><a id="china-lands-a-rover-on-mars"></a></p><h1 id="China-lands-a-rover-on-Mars"><a href="#China-lands-a-rover-on-Mars" class="headerlink" title="China lands a rover on Mars"></a>China lands a rover on Mars</h1><p>The feat shows off the country’s growing capabilities in space</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>At 17:17 gmt on May 14th Tianwen-1, a Chinese mission which had been orbiting Mars since February 10th, made a subtle adjustment to its trajectory—one that put it on course to hit the planet’s surface six hours later. After three hours, however, it broke itself in two. One part readjusted its path so as to skim past the planet and stay in orbit. The other, a sealed shell with a heatshield on the outside and a precious cargo within, plummeted on towards the surface at 17,000km an hour.</p><p>It entered the atmosphere about 125km above the ground, blazing across the alien sky like a meteor. Once friction with the air had bled off most of its kinetic energy it deployed a parachute. The shell broke open, revealing a landing platform with four legs, a rocket engine and a six-wheeled rover fastened to its top. The engine ignited. When the platform had just 100 metres left to go it paused briefly, hovering as its sensors looked for obstacles that would impede a safe landing. Then it set itself down in a cloud of red dust on Utopia Planitia, one of the great flat plains of Mars’s northern hemisphere.</p><p>Touch down<br>Entry, descent and landing (edl) is historically the riskiest part of any mission to the Martian surface. Every engineering system has to work perfectly. And it all has to happen entirely on the basis of onboard data processing and programming, unsupervised by any human being. Mars is currently 320m kilometres from Earth, meaning radio signals between the planets take 18 minutes to travel each way. By the time the engineers, researchers and bigwigs gathered at the Beijing Aerospace Control Centre knew for sure that the spacecraft was entering the atmosphere, the dust had long since settled.</p><p>Once news of its arrival reached mission control, Chinese media lost little time in announcing the triumph to a waking nation which had, for the most part, been blissfully unaware of the drama playing out in the heavens. Aware of edl’s risks, the authorities had given little advance warning of the landing attempt. The details of Tianwen-1’s orbital manoeuvres were worked out by amateurs monitoring Chinese telemetry using an Apollo-era radio dish in Germany.</p><p>The announcement stressed not just the landing itself, but the complete success of the mission it capped. By orbiting and landing on a planet China had never previously visited, Tianwen-1 had become the most successful first mission to Mars in history. America did not land on Mars until five years after first orbiting it.</p><p>That said, both America’s first orbiter and its subsequent Viking landers made their trips in the 1970s. The Soviet Union managed a landing then, too. But the European Space Agency (esa) has twice failed at the task, in 2003 and 2016—the second of those attempts a partnership with the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Getting it right first time definitely ranks as an achievement, even half a century on. It is, moreover, one achievement among many. In January 2019 China became the first country to put a rover on the far side of the Moon. And last month it launched the first part of a new space station. A second part is due up shortly.</p><p>China still has some way to go, though. The capabilities of Perseverance, the one-tonne lander which America’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration, nasa, deposited at a precisely chosen location in Jezero crater on February 18th, far outstrip those of the Chinese rover, Zhurong, which is a quarter of the size. And Perseverance has the benefit of established orbital infrastructure in the form of the Mars Relay Network, five satellites (three American, two European) that can send high-bandwidth data back to Earth. One of the reasons given for Zhurong’s failure to send back pictures until May 19th was that the Tianwen-1 orbiter had to refine its orbit yet again in order to pass on messages.</p><p>When Zhurong does trundle off its platform and on to the plain, attention will focus on data from its ground-penetrating radar, which is designed to be able to detect ice at depths of up to 100 metres. The distribution of ice is of consuming interest to those who study Mars, defining as it does the limits of the planet’s potential habitability both in its less-arid past and, perhaps, its human-settled future.</p><p>The Mars Subsurface Water Ice Mapping project (swim), an attempt to synthesise results from many different approaches to the question, suggests that when Viking-2 scraped the surface at its landing site in another part of Utopia Planitia in the 1970s, its robotic arm may have been within centimetres of permafrost. But that was at 48°N. Zhurong’s landing site, at 25°N, is within the Martian tropics, where underground ice is much less likely to persist close to the surface. Unlikelihood, though, is not impossibility—and it would make any icy discovery even more exciting.</p><p>Wild rovers<br>How far Zhurong will be able to go in search of ice is hard to say. It is similar in size and design to Spirit and Opportunity, two rovers America landed in 2004, and like them it has an official life expectancy of 90 sols (a sol is a Martian day, 40 minutes longer than an Earthly one). Spirit ended up lasting six years, Opportunity 14, over which it travelled 45km. If Chinese engineering is of a similar calibre and its operation teams similarly canny, Zhurong may still have quite a journey ahead of it.</p><p>It may even last until the next landmark in Mars exploration: the return of samples to Earth. It is a goal nasa has spoken of for decades and now intends to realise. Part of Perserverance’s mission is to assemble a cache of samples to be picked up later by a joint nasa-esa mission. Some years hence, the plan goes, America will land a package close to that cache. This will contain both a small European rover to retrieve the samples and a rocket capable of getting them into orbit, whence another European spacecraft will scoop them up and bring them back to Earth. It is the most ambitious planetary-science mission currently being planned.</p><p>China is reported to be planning a sample-return mission, too, for launch around the end of the decade. It showed some of the capabilities required for this by returning samples from the Moon last year. If it were to content itself with bringing back any old sample that could be reached from a lander with a rocket on board, that mission could conceivably be accomplished at about the same time as the more sophisticated nasa-esa attempt. That really would be an interesting space race. </p><p><a id="books--arts---a-century-ago-ludwig-wittgenstein-changed-philosophy-for-ever"></a></p><h1 id="Books-amp-arts-—A-century-ago-Ludwig-Wittgenstein-changed-philosophy-for-ever"><a href="#Books-amp-arts-—A-century-ago-Ludwig-Wittgenstein-changed-philosophy-for-ever" class="headerlink" title="(Books &amp; arts)—A century ago Ludwig Wittgenstein changed philosophy for ever"></a>(Books &amp; arts)—A century ago Ludwig Wittgenstein changed philosophy for ever</h1><p>Written in the trenches, his “Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus” still baffles and inspires</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Of all the innovations that sprang from the trenches of the first world war—the zip, the tea bag, the tank—the “Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus” must be among the most elegant and humane. When the conflict began, this short treatise was a jumble of ideas in the head of a young Austrian soldier and erstwhile philosophy student called Ludwig Wittgenstein. By the time he was released from a prisoner-of-war camp during the Versailles peace conference, it had taken rough shape over a few dozen mud-splattered pages in his knapsack. In 1921 Wittgenstein found a publisher, and philosophy was changed for ever.</p><p>That the book ever made it into print was miraculous. Before the war, as a student at Cambridge, Wittgenstein’s talent was clear to his contemporaries, who begged him to put his many thoughts into writing. He refused, fearing that an imperfect work of philosophy was worthless. His mentor, Bertrand Russell, made a habit of taking notes when the two spoke, lest his protégé’s genius be lost to memory. Wittgenstein himself had other preoccupations, principally suicide.</p><p>He was in Vienna visiting his family when the conflict began. Then aged 25, Wittgenstein answered the call for troops and was sent to the Eastern Front to fight for the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Largely cut off from his British friends, he was left with his own thoughts and a copy of Leo Tolstoy’s “The Gospel in Brief”;he would mimic its pared-down, staccato structure in the “Tractatus”. “If I don’t live to see the end of this war,” he confided to a friend, “I must be prepared for all my work to go to nothing.” He resolved, finally, to write.</p><p>Stuff and nonsense<br>He drew on the work of Gottlob Frege, a German logician. Still, the “Tractatus” was revolutionary in its naivety. What, Wittgenstein asked simply, is language? Why and how do the squawks a person makes, and the squiggles they draw, conjure up all that is in the world? Anthony Quinton, a British philosopher, compared his instincts to those of Sir Isaac Newton, who had troubled to ask why stones fall to the ground when others had been content enough to say, “They just do.”</p><p>Wittgenstein’s answer was the picture theory of language, a neat demonstration of the relation between words and the real world. He argued that all meaningful thoughts that people have are arrangements of pictures, which, when expressed in language as “propositions”, can be communicated to others. This is what “the cat sat on the mat” has in common with sophisticated sentences. At least in the cases of tangible things like felines, that might seem obvious. But Wittgenstein was breaking new ground. The idea came to him as he read a report about a court case involving a car crash (still a relatively novel occurrence). Learning that a lawyer had used toy cars and dolls to explain the smash, he grasped the pictorial basis of language.</p><p>He applied this view to the central problems that had perplexed philosophers for millennia: God, morality, beauty. He concluded that, since philosophy largely discusses things that are not demonstrable in the world and cannot therefore be pictured, many of its propositions are not meaningful. Instead, most philosophy is “nonsense”. He preferred to focus on the few areas that could be meaningfully discussed with language. That led him to a final, definitive proposition: “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” Or, as he put it elsewhere in the “Tractatus”, “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” In his preface Wittgenstein claimed to have found “the final solution of the problems” of philosophy.</p><p>Readers have been dazzled and puzzled by this brazenness for a century. The appeal is not only the originality of the ideas but their forthright expression. Fewer than a hundred pages long, the book is structured around seven enigmatic main statements, beginning with: “The world is all that is the case.” These are followed by supplementary points ordered in a decimal sequence. Wittgenstein offers little justification and almost no evidence. He intended his statements to be inarguable.</p><p>It may not be coincidental that the “Tractatus” was published a year before three seminal works of modernist literature: T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land”, Virginia Woolf’s “Jacob’s Room” and James Joyce’s “Ulysses”. Initial reviewers appreciated Wittgenstein’s literary flair while often misconstruing his philosophy. Even Frege, one of his heroes, considered the slim book to be “an artistic rather than a scientific achievement”.</p><p>For Wittgenstein, convinced of its brilliance, this was not enough. He felt Frege, along with his mentor Russell, had missed the ramifications of the “Tractatus”. He retreated from academia to rural Austria where he taught at a primary school for most of the 1920s. For the brightest children, his influence was life-shaping. He ignored the less able, unless he was so incensed by their ignorance as to cane them.</p><p>While Wittgenstein was away, the import of the “Tractatus” sank in. By the time he returned to Cambridge in 1929 he was the most vaunted philosopher in the world. John Maynard Keynes ran into him on the way from London. “God has arrived,” Keynes wrote to a friend, “I met him on the 5.15 train.” A young Alan Turing attended his lectures. Like his writing, Wittgenstein’s teaching flouted tradition. He sat among his students, rattling off questions on the lines of “Why might we think that blue is closer to green than red?”</p><p>As in the primary school, the slower students floundered; the quick-witted worshipped him. Taking his claim to have “solved” philosophy to its logical end, one disciple left Cambridge to work in a canning factory. Another went into toolmaking. Ray Monk, Wittgenstein’s biographer, reckons no other university would have allowed him to lecture undergraduates.</p><p>God’s afterlife<br>Still, he tired of what he called “the stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction” of university life. After a few years he rediscovered the iconoclasm of the “Tractatus” and began to pooh-pooh his own ideas. How far he repudiated the book is disputed. After his death in 1951 some of his later thoughts were collated as “Philosophical Investigations”, but he never published another book in his lifetime. The “Tractatus”, reckons Constantine Sandis of the British Wittgenstein Society, “contains the seeds of a philosophical outlook that informed all his thought throughout his life”.</p><p>To mark its centenary the society is hosting an international symposium of philosophers. The Wittgenstein Initiative in Vienna is curating a virtual exhibition of his life and work. Luciano Bazzocchi, a Wittgenstein scholar, has edited new editions in German and English. But the influence of the “Tractatus” extends beyond academia. Its author’s admirers include Jasper Johns, an American abstract painter; Iris Murdoch, whose debut novel centred on a line from the book; Derek Jarman, who directed a Wittgenstein biopic; and the film-making Coen brothers. Modern readers have spotted new resonances. “Wittgenstein literally wrote his books in tweet form,” a fan joked recently on Twitter.</p><p>In philosophy itself, the legacy of the “Tractatus” is complex. In the middle of the 20th century it was a lodestar for philosophy professors in English-speaking universities; a band of devoted Wittgensteinians still carry the torch. But over the decades, Wittgenstein’s pronouncements on the end of philosophy and the meaninglessness of many of its debates came to seem less convincing. “All the branches of philosophy that Wittgenstein thought would get shut down have flourished,” acknowledges Mr Monk. Advances in the philosophy of mind and political theory, and in the emerging field of “public philosophy”, have undermined his claims.</p><p>The enigmatic man himself might not have set too much store by those developments. “Wittgenstein had complete contempt for academic philosophers,” says Mr Monk. “How highly regarded he was by them didn’t matter to him.” </p><p><a id="why-english-speakers-should-not-give-up-on-foreign-languages"></a></p><h1 id="Why-English-speakers-should-not-give-up-on-foreign-languages"><a href="#Why-English-speakers-should-not-give-up-on-foreign-languages" class="headerlink" title="Why English-speakers should not give up on foreign languages"></a>Why English-speakers should not give up on foreign languages</h1><p>Governments that cut funding for language study will come to regret it</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Aston university in Birmingham is closing the department that teaches languages and translation. The University of Sheffield stands accused of sending its language students on dumbed-down courses to save money. Fewer pupils at British schools are taking foreign-language exams (a drop in French, the most popular choice, accounts for most of the decline). A hasty analysis might see this trend as a nationalist, populist, post-Brexit mindset at work. But it has been gathering for a long time, not just in Britain but in America, and not just in the Brexit and Trump eras, but well before them.</p><p>The tragic attack on America of September 11th 2001 had one positive consequence. Many Americans realised how entangled their lives were with those of people around the world, and saw that they often did not understand their counterparts’ hopes and fears. Some patriotically applied to join the diplomatic and intelligence services; a few swotty types resolved to learn foreign languages. The number of students studying Arabic at university soared (albeit from a very low base). But the country’s attention has since wandered. The most recent research in America by the Modern Language Association found a drop of 9.2% in enrolment in university-level foreign-languages courses between 2013 and 2016.</p><p>Much more than tub-thumping politics, the likely culprit for all this is the global rise of English. Converse with Europeans of different ages and a three-generation pattern emerges. If they speak English at all, the oldest do so with heavy accents and grammatical mistakes. Middle-aged folk, especially in places like Scandinavia or the Netherlands, have light accents and merely mangle the odd idiom. The youngsters often put their elders to shame. They speak with American accents that could have been plucked from “Friends”—except that they did not pick them up from anything so primitive as an old-fashioned television. Endless time on YouTube, or gaming live with others while trash-talking in English, has made that seem less a foreign language than one of their own.</p><p>All this might understandably make youngsters in Anglophone countries wonder why they should bother learning French or Spanish at school. Why endure the arduous middle phase of learning a language—when you have some knowledge but no experience—if the awkward jumble that comes out of your mouth is liable to be met with a reply in flawless English? True fluency is valuable, as anyone who has sweated to achieve it will proudly attest. But that half-knowledge, the typical outcome of many courses, increasingly looks redundant.</p><p>Yet there are several good reasons to persist with language-learning in schools and universities. First, anyone who plans to move to another country, or interacts with one regularly for work or otherwise, still benefits hugely from almost any familiarity with its language. There is no way to genuinely get to know a place without being able to chit-chat or watch a bit of its television. (Anglophones who doubt this should imagine understanding their country with zero knowledge of English.) Second, even if your contact with the culture in question is only occasional, your efforts to use its language will be much appreciated—at least by older residents, who might otherwise scowl at you for assuming everyone is happy to speak English.</p><p>Foreign languages also have an intellectual value all their own—even if you never set foot in the relevant country. Latin and Greek were for centuries considered training for the mind; the same is true of immersion in any alien tongue. This is how many people acquire what formal knowledge of grammar they have. And the effort involved in talking in a foreign language makes you slow down and reflect on what you are saying and why. Researchers have even found that people make more rational decisions when speaking another language.</p><p>Beyond the individual benefits, 21st-century economies still need people who can function fluently abroad. Just as universal maths education creates a big pool of potential engineers, widespread language teaching does the same for business executives, diplomats, soldiers and spies. Speaking another language is not just a courtesy to others. Much of the benefit still accrues to those who put in the work—and the societies that support them. Even as English continues to rise, Anglophone countries that slash budgets for foreign languages may find themselves lost for words.</p><p><a id="the-tainted-genius-of-rudyard-kipling"></a></p><h1 id="The-tainted-genius-of-Rudyard-Kipling"><a href="#The-tainted-genius-of-Rudyard-Kipling" class="headerlink" title="The tainted genius of Rudyard Kipling"></a>The tainted genius of Rudyard Kipling</h1><p>The author of the “Just So Stories” is a case study in reconciling admiration with judgment</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>How the Just So Stories Were Made. By John Batchelor. Yale University Press; 240 pages; $25 and £18.99</p><p>Already, in his mid-30s, the Bombay-born writer Rudyard Kipling had begun to polarise the public. In 1901 satirists claimed that “the British Empire was placed in his charge” as a precocious child, “and it is still there”. By 1910, writes John Batchelor, the hardline imperialism that Kipling developed alongside his friendship with the colonial plunderer Cecil Rhodes meant that “his reputation was damaged, and would remain damaged”.</p><p>Yet the novelist Henry James, another friend, thought the master-craftsman who wrote “Kim”, “The Jungle Books” and some of his age’s finest short fiction was “the most complete man of genius…I have ever known”. T.S. Eliot championed his verse and called him “the greatest Englishman of letters of his generation”. More recently Salman Rushdie, also Bombay-born, dubbed Kipling “a writer with a storm inside him”, who “creates a mirror-storm of contradictory responses”.</p><p>Today he is an avatar for debates over Britain’s past, and a case study in reconciling admiration with judgment. Critics and readers fret over the paradoxes of an author who, in a poem, thanked “Allah Who gave me two/Separate sides to my head”. This ingenious, versatile and empathetic literary magpie, once a teenage journalist in colonial Lahore, became “a ravenous observer of the world”. Nonetheless, his allegiance to British imperialism “pulled him into explicitly racist writing”. How could the strident jingoist and the shape-shifting magician share the same brain? Like Kipling himself, Mr Batchelor lets the big picture emerge from small details.</p><p>Fluent, engaging and gently erudite, his account centres on the making of the “Just So Stories”. These 12 “alternative creation narratives” were originally meant for Kipling’s beloved daughter Josephine, who died, aged six, in 1899; they were published in 1902. He combined text, drawings (see picture) and design into an enchanting package that young readers still enjoy.</p><p>This trumpeter of empire somehow emerged from the arts-and-crafts aestheticism of late-Victorian Britain. His uncle by marriage was the august painter-designer Edward Burne-Jones. His father was John Lockwood Kipling, an artist with Pre-Raphaelite connections who headed the Mayo School of Arts in Lahore (now Pakistan’s National College of Arts) and researched traditional Indian skills. As Mr Batchelor says, in the “Just So Stories” and elsewhere, Rudyard was meticulously attentive to the presentation of his work.</p><p>With their talking animals, wondrous transformations and incantatory, fairy-tale voices, the “Just So Stories” use imagery and mythology not just from the India of Kipling’s fondly remembered youth but other far-flung places he had visited, from South Africa to New England, Australia to the Amazon. Several tales, including “The Elephant’s Child”, “How the Leopard Got his Spots” and “How the Camel Got his Hump” pivot on acts of rebellion and disobedience, with the discoveries—and punishments—that ensue. Kipling sympathises with the adventurers yet depicts their sometimes painful comeuppance.</p><p>For his part, Mr Batchelor sees the stories as “jewel-like works of art”. His analysis takes in the main themes of Kipling’s life and work, from his “fluid and protean” sense of identity, to his infatuation with Rhodes and his Pre-Raphaelite heritage. Not least, there is the “deep and lasting” grief for Josephine that imbues the tales with a subtext of mortality and loss.</p><p>But he stumbles when he says the “Just So Stories” are “a text from which the concerns of the empire are successfully excluded”. Kipling’s flag-waving brand of globalisation, a cultural eclecticism that mingles fascination with condescension, his gift for identifying both with underdogs and overlords—these traits surface in his fables, deepening and darkening them. Even here, what Mr Batchelor calls the “obvious split” in Kipling “between the creative writer and the political writer” never quite holds firm. Those “separate sides to my head” are eternally locked together. </p><p><a id="a-south-korean-city-offers-two-ways-to-remember-past-traumas"></a></p><h1 id="A-South-Korean-city-offers-two-ways-to-remember-past-traumas"><a href="#A-South-Korean-city-offers-two-ways-to-remember-past-traumas" class="headerlink" title="A South Korean city offers two ways to remember past traumas"></a>A South Korean city offers two ways to remember past traumas</h1><p>A cemetery in Gwangju commemorates a massacre in 1980. Artists do it differently</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Once you start to notice it, history is hard to overlook in Gwangju. All over town, traffic signs point to sites associated with “5·18”. The three digits stand for May 18th, the day in 1980 when the military dictatorship that then ruled South Korea began cracking down on pro-democracy protests in the south-western city. During the ten-day stand-off that followed, hundreds of civilians, many of them students, were killed by the security forces. Hundreds more were later prosecuted for taking part in the demonstrations.</p><p>Since then, much has changed in South Korea. The uprising in Gwangju is now widely considered a pivotal event in the country’s journey to democracy. Chun Doo-hwan, the general who ordered the crackdown and assumed the presidency shortly afterwards, was given a suspended prison sentence last year for defaming an eyewitness to the massacre (Mr Chun had continued to deny that helicopters fired on civilians). Only the most ardent right-wingers still gripe about “communist rioters”, a reference to the conspiracy theory, enlisted as justification by the generals, that the protests had been fanned by North Korean agents.</p><p>What happened in May 1980 is largely established. How to remember the tragedy is much less clear. “I ask myself: what is May 18th, what does it mean to somebody like me who hasn’t experienced the event and doesn’t remember it?” says Minouk Lim, an artist who has grappled with South Korea’s history. Two very different answers to that question about memory and meaning are offered in Gwangju.</p><p>The national cemetery on the northern outskirts of the city exemplifies the first approach. Officially described as a “sacred spot for democracy”, the solemn, austere place hosts an annual commemoration of the uprising. It is dominated by twin pillars, 40 metres tall, holding an ovular symbol and towering above the graves of many of the massacre’s victims. The monument is flanked by bronze murals and statues depicting scenes and themes from the protests. Visitors are asked to bow their heads respectfully before entering.</p><p>The graveyard immortalises the heroism of the dead. “Mother, I will fight for democracy, justice and freedom”, reads the gravestone of Jun Young-jin, killed at 17; in an accompanying photo he wears big glasses and a school uniform. Pointing out the grave shared by Yoon Sang-won, one of the protest’s leaders, and his “spirit wife”, Park Gi-sun, a labour activist, a guide recalls a remark Yoon made shortly before he was killed at 29: “Today we lose, but history will remember us as winners.”</p><p>For many on the country’s left, this curious mix of triumphalism and victimhood, frozen in time, could serve as the basis of an official national identity. Moon Jae-in, the current president, would like to see the spirit of Gwangju celebrated in the constitution. By contrast, a different way to interpret history has been on display in the city in the past few weeks. It is less prescriptive and more visceral.</p><p>Restless spirits<br>In the middle of extensive parkland, swathes of which serve as illicit vegetable patches for local residents, sit the ruined remains of the former armed forces hospital. During the uprising, protesters who had been tortured were taken there to be treated, only to find themselves face to face with their interrogators once more. Today the wind blows through abandoned corridors, rattling crumbling door frames. Plants crawl through broken windows from the courtyard. Fading notices on peeling walls warn against spilling state secrets, or instruct staff on how to dispense antidepressants.</p><p>But like other sites around the city linked to May 18th, sections of the hospital were temporarily brought back to life this year by artists commissioned by the Gwangju biennale (an exhibition first held in 1995, in part to perpetuate the democratic values of the uprising). Unlike the cemetery, with its air of permanence, the engagement with the past in the hospital was provisional and questioning.</p><p>Ms Lim filled part of it with tokens of a much earlier massacre: hundreds of wooden canes, a handful at first but rising in number to fill half a room and then an entire ward, laid out side by side on blue cloth. The intricately carved objects, which Ms Lim has used in her art for years, were crafted by Chai Eui-jin, who survived the slaughter of most of his village by the South Korean army in 1949. (The state blamed the killings on communist guerrillas, whom the soldiers were supposedly pursuing.) Chai lost nine relatives and spent a lifetime trying to get the authorities to acknowledge what had happened, all the while channelling his grief into his carvings. To Ms Lim, it made little sense to think about May 18th as an isolated incident. “It’s part of a long history of state violence that people still know little about.”</p><p>Painful if neglected memories surfaced throughout the hospital. In the foyer old televisions displayed images of plants, suggesting renewal. The screens sat on blocks of pavement into which Bae Young-hwan had carved excerpts from “March for the Beloved”, an anthem written for the “spirit wedding” of the couple from the national cemetery; the song was recently adopted by protesters in Hong Kong.</p><p>Moon Seon-hee filled a corridor that leads to the former intensive-care ward with potted daisies. Catching the sunlight filtering through the windows, they were meant to evoke the concept of care (see picture). Loudspeakers placed among the flowers played accounts of the turmoil of 1980, witnessed by children from that time but read by their modern counterparts. In another wing a video installation by Kader Attia, a French artist, showed interviews about trauma from around the world; before it came room after room of prosthetic legs perched on wooden chairs.</p><p>In another contrast with the national cemetery, here the engagement with the past was itself ephemeral. The artworks are now being dismantled and the hospital turned over to its ghosts—before in the future being converted into a national trauma centre, where psychological scars will be treated in another way.

The family had last gone by donkey, so that he and his 11 brothers could be made deacons in the cathedral. That trip had taken two days. He was going barefoot now, and he was only nine.</p><p>He had 50 cents in his pocket, and had not told his parents he was leaving. But the village offered him nothing except priest-school, where he would learn to read religious books and, very probably, become a Coptic priest like his father. Addis jumped with possibilities, so away he went.</p><p>It was not quite as good as he imagined. He found work as a bearer, toting loads on a pole over his small shoulder. But much of the time, like the other swarming street children, he begged and slept in the churchyard of St George’s cathedral. His lucky break came when, one day, a rich Turkish lady dropped cheeses from her basket and he raced to pick them up. She took him on as her general skivvy and, between fetching water and chopping wood, he could go to proper primary school.</p><p>That made the difference. Life opened up. He sailed through all his tests, and won a scholarship to the General Wingate boarding school. At first, being a street child, his place was given to a rich boy. But he presented himself to the headmaster, barefoot, dusty and wrapped in a blanket, and recited the English words he had carefully rehearsed: “My name is Asfaw Yemiru. I am here to learn.” Immediately, the head took to him.</p><p>From those chance seeds grew one of the best and most famous schools in Ethiopia, the Asra Hawariat School for the poor. Its name meant “Footsteps of the Apostles”. By 2020 more than 120,000 boys and girls, saved from the street, had passed through it. They learned the three Rs, English, history and geography, as well as how to grow vegetables, raise chickens, make pots and weave on looms Asfaw had made himself—in short, to make a living. His deacon-training had been brief, but one firm strand remained: to give what he had received back to others.</p><p>Wingate school made him well aware of that command. There he was horrified to see that dining-room leftovers were buried or burned by the staff. He began to distribute them instead to the children who stood outside to beg. But it was not simply food they needed. They wanted him to teach them, and so he started, under the trees in the churchyard of Petros and Paulos, when his own lessons were over. He was only 14 himself, not much taller than the crowd of pupils who sat eagerly in front of him and watched the board on which he chalked up letters. In the long and short rains they had to huddle under the church’s lower canopy or in the niches of big people’s tombs. At night, many children slept there.</p><p>Word of his lessons spread. They were open to all the poor, and free. By 1960 there were almost 300 in his classes, from all over the city and even beyond it, and the church administrators began to complain. In 1961 the emperor, Haile Selassie, gave him land, just beside Wingate and thick with eucalyptus trees. There he built a school with the children’s help. It took root and flourished.</p><p>The first buildings were not much to look at. Their walls were made of broken brick and eucalyptus laths, and everything was flimsy. Inside, the ten classrooms were divided from each other only by waist-high partitions, in case one teacher had charge of three classes. (Good teachers were hard to find.) The shelves and cupboards in the classrooms doubled as bunks. If you opened a latch, you might find a crumpled blanket and a small girl reading. Or a boy might suddenly drop from near the ceiling like a cat, broadly smiling. Some people, shocked, said Asra Hawariat was just a set of shacks. But it became 64 classrooms, with a library wing and proper dormitories. Whatever it looked like, he didn’t care; his only point was education.</p><p>Not all his pupils were orphans. Many were simply part of the huge child-population in Ethiopia, still a third of it, whose parents could not afford to send them to school. After lessons they would still go off to carry loads, as he had done, or shine shoes. To make sure they stayed at school, he made house calls and gave the parents cash, milk and school-grown vegetables. It seemed to work.</p><p>That eager spirit marked him. When he needed to expand his school he raised money by walking to Harar and back, 620 miles across desert. He had gained the original site in the dangerous, time-honoured way of throwing himself in front of the emperor’s limousine as he visited Wingate, shouting “Give us land!”—and the emperor agreed. When the mayor of Addis held things up, he loitered by his office every day to pester him. Friends would remind him of the tale of the frog and the lion: when the frog did too much croaking, the lion ate it. He laughed that off, since education was worth making a noise about.</p><p>He also felt touched by luck—or the blessing of God. Whenever he was desperate for money, which was often, something turned up. Once he was given the unclaimed prize money from the national lottery. Another time, Winchester College sent him money, and the headmaster of Wingate wiped out his debts. The emperor himself suddenly gave him a prize of $10,000, as well as a piece of forest land for a second campus. In 2001 he was awarded the World’s Children’s Prize.</p><p>He was pleased, but success also bothered him. Year after year his school achieved one of the highest pass-rates in the Standard 8 graduating exams. Yet no good lay in certificates and university if pupils then forgot where they had come from. They had to be socially useful, perhaps teaching illiterate adults they knew, or instructing their own parents. They had to work to narrow the vast gap between the rich and the poor.</p><p>Those worlds came together when, on two occasions, Haile Selassie visited his school. Guards attended in smart pith helmets, and little girls in white dresses gave the emperor flowers. But he, the principal, went barefoot, as he usually did; as he had done on his long, long walk from Bulga to Addis Ababa.</p>]]></content>

So far this month 4,290 migrants have reached Italy’s shores, compared with 1,654 in the whole of May last year. Many set sail from Tunisia. The number of arrivals in 2021 is now more than 13,000—triple the volume in the same period last year. And the summer months, when crossing the Mediterranean is easiest, lie ahead.</p><p>All this is manna from heaven for Matteo Salvini, the leader of the populist Northern League and the politician who has suffered the most since Mario Draghi came to power in February. The League’s poll ratings have fallen since mid-2019 (see chart). That was when Mr Salvini (pictured) torpedoed an earlier coalition in which the League was allied to the maverick Five Star Movement. (He had hoped to nab the top job, but failed.) His party now has the backing of less than 22% of voters, compared with more than 37% at its peak, although that still makes it the country’s most popular party.</p><p>A resurgence in the number of people arriving illegally by boat allows Mr Salvini to play again on the fears of uncontrolled immigration that helped fuel the League’s rise to power in 2018. “With millions of Italians in difficulty, we can’t take care of thousands of [irregular migrants],” he wrote in a Facebook post on May 9th. The tactic might not work so well this time, as covid-19 and the state of the economy are the main concerns in voters’ minds; but a recovery accompanied by a surge in arrivals could quickly change that.</p><p>Mr Salvini has been on the back foot. One reason is that the League has two souls. Its core support is among the small-scale entrepreneurs of northern Italy. Its time-honoured demand was for secession—or, at least, greater autonomy—to reduce the cost to the north of bankrolling the southern half of the country, which the League depicted as shiftless and corrupt. After becoming leader of the party in 2013, Mr Salvini wooed a broader constituency: more Eurosceptic and blue-collar and which, at the most recent election in 2018, included millions of voters in central and even southern Italy. Among the few things the two wings of the League have in common is a shared mistrust of globalisation—and of immigration in particular.</p><p>The arrival of Mr Draghi has made it impossible for Mr Salvini to satisfy both factions. For the League’s original followers, it was unthinkable that he would miss an opportunity to influence a government charged with allocating some €200bn ($240bn) of the eu’s post-pandemic recovery funds. For the new, more populist League voters, it was just as unthinkable that he would cosy up to a former managing director of Goldman Sachs who supports both European integration and the single currency.</p><p>Mr Salvini has tried to square the circle by allowing the League to join Mr Draghi’s government without taking a job in it himself. That has left him free to heckle. Taking up cudgels on behalf of Italy’s restaurateurs, he has demanded a more rapid lifting of covid-19 restrictions. He has repeatedly attacked Mr Draghi’s health minister for his caution in this area.</p><p>Yet this ambiguous strategy has not prevented many League voters from becoming disillusioned. According to pollsters, most of those who have deserted the League have switched their support to the Brothers of Italy (fdi), the one big party that declined to join Mr Draghi’s coalition. The Brothers, who as it happens are led by a woman, Giorgia Meloni, are heirs to the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, which wanted to revive the glories of Benito Mussolini’s Italy. Though committed to parliamentary means, the Brothers’ programme is profoundly nativist. To repel migrants, it favours a naval blockade. To obviate the need for immigrant labour in the future, it offers “the mightiest plan in the history of Italy for support of the family and the birth rate”.</p><p>The fdi would also criminalise the spreading of Islamist ideas, ban the use of foreign terms in official documents and provide state aid for Italian goods in contravention of the spirit and possibly the letter of eu law. But then Ms Meloni’s party is deeply suspicious of the eu. Its programme advocates a “rediscussion” of all the eu’s treaties and of the euro (though it carefully avoids calling for Italy actually to give up the single currency, let alone its eu membership).</p><p>The rise in support for Ms Meloni’s party has matched almost exactly the fall in support for the League. Polls suggest the fdi now commands around 18% of the vote. Those figures point to a scenario that many in the rest of Europe will find alarming. Together, the fdi and the League enjoy the support of 40% of the electorate—possibly enough for a majority in parliament after the next election. With the backing of Forza Italia, the more moderate but enfeebled party of Silvio Berlusconi, a flamboyant former prime minister, they could easily form a government.</p><p>It is thus plausible to imagine that, no sooner will Mr Draghi have put in place a plan for an economic recovery than responsibility for implementing it could pass to a stridently populist-nationalist government, infused with Euroscepticism and headed by either Mr Salvini or Ms Meloni. The two parties are in theory committed to an alliance, with whichever does best supplying the prime minister.</p><p>On May 16th Ms Meloni said: “I am preparing myself to govern the nation.” In a future nationalist coalition, the fdi would find its Eurosceptic instincts severely constrained by the need to keep the cash flowing from Brussels. Even so, the fdi could be an awkward partner. Its leaders want a constitutional amendment to give Italian law priority over European law and, in the context of support for law enforcement, a revision of “the so-called law on torture”.</p><p>Elections are due within two years. They could come much earlier if the current coalition falls apart. That could happen sooner than many expect. Mr Draghi might even precipitate a collapse, if he quits his post to run for the presidency early next year. The odds of that happening shortened this week, as the incumbent, Sergio Matarella, appeared to rule out seeking an extension. </p><p><a id="germany-is-apologising-for-crimes-a-century-ago-in-namibia"></a></p><h1 id="Germany-is-apologising-for-crimes-a-century-ago-in-Namibia"><a href="#Germany-is-apologising-for-crimes-a-century-ago-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Germany is apologising for crimes a century ago in Namibia"></a>Germany is apologising for crimes a century ago in Namibia</h1><p>The slaughter of the Herero was genocide, says Berlin</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Tucked away in a military cemetery in the Berlin suburb of Neukölln you eventually find it: a small plaque dedicated to “the victims of German colonial rule in Namibia…in particular the colonial war”. Berlin has no shortage of memorials to the crimes of Germans. Yet this is the country’s only commemoration of the genocide it inflicted in 1904-08 on the Herero and Nama peoples in what was then German South-West Africa. The plaque was laid in 2009 by locals anxious to counter the symbolism of the Hererostein that looms behind it: a rock bearing a memorial dating from 1907 to seven German soldiers in the imperial Schutztruppe force who died in the Herero uprising that triggered the killings. The rock is scarred with rivulets of dried red paint, having been defaced last year during Berlin’s Black Lives Matter protests.</p><p>This scene sums up Germany’s complicated attitude to the killings, in which at least 75,000 Herero and Nama were slain in battle, executed, starved in the Oma heke desert or worked to death in labour camps. It was not until 2015, after years of tongue-twisting, that the German government accepted the term genocide and embarked on negotiations with its Namibian counterpart over how to acknowledge and compensate for the actions of its forebears.</p><p>The talks, led by specially appointed envoys and conducted in high secrecy, have been difficult, punctuated with bitter rows and briefing wars. Aggrieved Herero pursued a parallel lawsuit in American courts. Yet on May 15th Deutschlandfunk radio reported that the two sides had at last reached agreement. Once consent is secured in the respective parliaments, a signing ceremony in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, could quickly follow.</p><p>As yet there is no public acknowledgement of a deal. However, its main elements have long been clear. Germany will formally acknowledge its culpability for genocide. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president, will reportedly issue a state apology in the Namibian parliament later this year. A thornier point is money, the main reason the talks dragged on for so long. Perhaps quietly supported by other former colonial powers, the German government has been leery of inviting further claims from its other former African possessions, such as Tanzania or Burundi, or from European descendants of the victims of Nazi atrocities. Officials argue that the Genocide Convention of 1948 cannot be applied retroactively, and therefore that Germany’s culpability is “moral-political” rather than legal.</p><p>That implies that the millions Germany will hand over will count not as “reparations” but, in effect, an extension of its development aid to Namibia. Funds will go to education, infrastructure and health care. Negotiators have been especially keen to have Germany finance land reform, too; a sore point in a country that is mostly too dry to grow much in the way of crops, and where most commercial farms are owned and run by whites. Germany could help pay for the redistribution of farmland from willing sellers to the Herero and Nama, many of whom are poor. “However you label it, the important thing is to support those parts of the Namibian population still affected,” says Wolfgang Kaleck, head of the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights, a legal ngo in Berlin.</p><p>That could be trickier than it sounds. The Herero and Nama are divided. Prominent figures in both groups have long felt shut out from talks led by a government dominated by the ethnic Ovambo, who were not affected by the German massacres (though its lead negotiator, Zed Ngavirue, is Herero). Most Herero people “will never accept this decision so long as they are excluded,” says Israel Kaunatjike, a Herero activist in Berlin. Some fear the Namibian government will be an untrustworthy custodian of whatever funds it receives. Reinhart Kößler of the University of Freiburg says the agreement could intensify existing conflicts.</p><p>As for the Germans, they have “to a modest extent” begun to wake up to their country’s imperial past in Africa, says Mr Kößler. This has been spurred partly by the opening of the Humboldt Forum, a new museum in the heart of Berlin that has inspired a debate over the exhibiting of plundered treasures—and the question of their restitution. The museum is named after two Prussian naturalist brothers whose attitude of open-minded globetrotting it seeks to encapsulate. The words of one of them, Wilhelm, are quoted at the bottom of that plaque in Neukölln: “Only those who know the past have a future.” </p><p><a id="balkan-money-laundering-is-booming"></a></p><h1 id="Balkan-money-laundering-is-booming"><a href="#Balkan-money-laundering-is-booming" class="headerlink" title="Balkan money-laundering is booming"></a>Balkan money-laundering is booming</h1><p>The property market makes a good place to hide ill-gotten gains</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On may 12th prosecutors in North Macedonia charged Nikola Gruevski, the country’s former prime minister, with money-laundering. It is alleged that he funnelled cash donated to his party through Belize to buy property illegally and conceal its ownership. He says the case is politically motivated. Meanwhile in Jahorina, a popular Bosnian ski resort, gangsters, plus the officials they have corrupted, have been investing in hotels. All kinds of corruption are rife. An expatriate, who has half-built a block of flats near his home in Vlora in south Albania, rails that building has stalled because he refuses to pay bribes to secure the necessary permits.</p><p>Across the Balkans dirty money is being laundered through property, distorting the market and inflating prices—much to the rage of ordinary house-hunters. Swanky new towers are rising in Tirana, Pristina and Belgrade. Although Balkan economies have been hit hard by covid-19, property prices in parts of the region have defied gravity. In Tirana they have more than doubled since 2017. Across Albania, the value of real-estate transactions rose by 6.7% in 2020.</p><p>The laundering of drug money, especially from cocaine trafficking, which has boomed in the past few years, is one reason why prices are rising, finds a new report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime, an international network of crime specialists. Another is that crooked officials need to invest their cash. All Balkan countries have sound money-laundering laws, but enforcement is patchy.</p><p>In the past decade Balkan crime syndicates have outgrown their small home countries. They now make much of their money abroad. Hence, says the report, a hefty share of their profits is invested abroad, too. But they still invest at home. Fatjona Mejdini, who helped research the report, says that Balkan governments are ambivalent about money-laundering. They want to crack down on it but simultaneously welcome the jobs and investment it can bring. As for the gangsters, murderous in making money, they are conservative when it comes to investing it. They “lack imagination” says Ms Mejdini, which is why they prefer bricks and mortar to the many other types of business they could use to launder their loot.</p><p><a id="nato-increasingly-sees-its-soldiers%E2%80%99-phones-as-a-liability"></a></p><h1 id="NATO-increasingly-sees-its-soldiers’-phones-as-a-liability"><a href="#NATO-increasingly-sees-its-soldiers’-phones-as-a-liability" class="headerlink" title="NATO increasingly sees its soldiers’ phones as a liability"></a>NATO increasingly sees its soldiers’ phones as a liability</h1><p>The Russians love eavesdropping on them</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Viktor kovalenko, a Ukrainian conscript defending the eastern city of Debaltseve from pro-Russian forces, once emerged from a shelter and, despite standing instructions not to do it, switched on his phone to call his wife. Soon “shells started exploding around me,” he recalls. Similar attacks killed others in his battalion. The year was 2015, and the enemy was learning to direct artillery fire to transmitting mobiles. Since then, phone use on the front line has sharply fallen but still continues, concedes Captain Volodymyr Fitio of Ukraine’s army.</p><p>Mobiles pose a dilemma for defence chiefs. A smartphone ban would hurt recruitment and morale. But a single mobile can betray a big operation “like a fire in the dark”, says Lieutenant-Colonel Rouven Habel, a former commander of nato’s troops in Lithuania.</p><p>Phones bring other dangers, too. With some technical know-how, “pinpoint propaganda” can be texted to mobiles. Such texts are “aimed at violating the psychological state” of soldiers, says Captain Fitio of those sent to Ukrainian soldiers. “Was an artillery barrage enjoyable?” one asked. Another needled, “Who is robbing your family while you are paid pennies waiting for your bullet?”</p><p>Among nato troops, those near Russia receive the most of these “psyop” texts, says Commander Michael Widmann of the alliance’s Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital. Texts that falsely announce infidelity and injuries are also sent to soldiers’ loved ones back home. “It throws you off,” he says. Last month he led nato’s Locked Shields 2021, the world’s biggest military cyber-exercise. It included the hacking of participants’ mobiles.</p><p>Another danger is portable eavesdropping devices that can be deployed on drones or hidden in cars. These imsi-catchers, as they are called, since they nab international mobile-subscriber identities, trick nearby mobiles into exchanging data. A hostile agent parked near a defence ministry might capture data from officials’ mobiles, says Lt-Col Linas Idzelis, a Lithuanian expert in information operations.</p><p>Soldiers are also fooled into tapping links and playing videos that download spyware. Hackers posing as flirty women have used this trick to infect the smartphones of Israeli troops near Gaza. Kaspersky Lab, a Russian security firm, was hired by the Israel Defence Forces to solve the problem. It found more than 50 compromised mobiles among Israeli soldiers, says a researcher who worked on the project.</p><p>Spyware can lurk in apps. In some, malicious code has been implanted without the developer’s knowledge. CrowdStrike, an American firm, has spotted a handful of “trojanised” apps that may feed data to Russian military intelligence, says Adam Meyers, the firm’s top researcher for state hacking. Commander Widmann notes the “terrible consequences” of an app briefly used by Ukrainian artillery teams to improve aim. It secretly passed users’ locations to pro-Kremlin forces.</p><p>A ride-hailing app of Russian origin called Yandex.Taxi has drawn attention. Edvinas Kerza, Lithuania’s former deputy minister of defence, says Russian spies can use it to access microphone data. The American government has told its soldiers not to download the app. Yandex.Taxi dismisses the allegation.</p><p>Data can sometimes be stolen from smartphones without unwitting help from victims. Shadowy firms sell “zero click” code that allows this. To make matters worse, hacking is not always even needed. As a cyber-war officer on nato’s Rukla base explains, telecom employees can be corrupted or blackmailed into providing access to subscribers’ phones.</p><p>An enemy that intercepts calls can “clone” voices with software that rearranges slivers of speech to fabricate phrases. It wouldn’t be hard, says Lt-Col Habel, to transmit seemingly authentic fake orders. nato orders aren’t sent on mobiles, but the deceit might sow confusion. Sweden has told its citizens that, if the country is attacked, any order to cease resistance would be fake.</p><p>Phoney orders transmitted by pro-Russian forces have led to Ukrainian deaths, says Lt-Col Idzelis. Such trickery bodes ill for the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union, a militia formed to resist a feared Russian invasion. The militia communicates by phone, so drills include texts with bogus orders intended to lure riflemen into traps. To verify instructions, members question senders. nato officials now tell troops to treat their mobiles as potentially compromised.</p><p>Smartphones have become a soft underbelly, says Sorin Ducaru, a former head of emerging threats at nato. The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which only escaped Soviet vassalage in 1991, are especially worried. Their governments have drafted strict rules on how mobiles can and cannot be used. Referring to lessons learned in Ukraine, Janis Mazeiks of Latvia’s foreign ministry describes these rules as “written in blood”. </p><p><a id="britain---britain%E2%80%99s-economy-is-hot-but-not-overheating"></a></p><h1 id="Britain-—Britain’s-economy-is-hot-but-not-overheating"><a href="#Britain-—Britain’s-economy-is-hot-but-not-overheating" class="headerlink" title="(Britain)—Britain’s economy is hot but not overheating"></a>(Britain)—Britain’s economy is hot but not overheating</h1><p>Consumers bought a lot of goods last year. Now it’s the turn of services</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The grand reopening of Nando’s, a chicken-oriented restaurant, in Stevenage’s Leisure Park on May 17th was a sedate affair. There was no ribbon-cutting and no long queue. But the youngish crowd was happy to be eating indoors for the first time since December, when the government ordered restaurants to close. Around a third of the indoor tables were occupied, more than would normally be expected on a Monday lunchtime. The staff do not think the restaurant will be full again until the multiplex cinema and bowling alley reopen later in the summer. But a busier than normal chain restaurant in a leisure park which currently has no leisure activities suggests that Britons are willing to go out and spend.</p><p>If the restaurant trade was having a good day, the pubs were having an excellent one. By mid-afternoon every table in the cavernous local branch of Wetherspoons, a pub chain, was occupied. At one table the manager interviewed a teenage student in further education who was looking for kitchen work. Among the questions was: “when can you start?”</p><p>The British economy is quickly recovering from its steepest drop in three centuries—so quickly, indeed, that some people are beginning to worry about the risk of overheating. Labour-market statistics released on May 18th showed a fall in unemployment and a pickup in wage growth. Inflation figures the following day revealed the largest monthly rise in the annual rate of consumer price inflation (cpi) in over a decade. Headline inflation rose from 0.7% in March to 1.5% in May.</p><p>But talk of overheating is premature. Global energy costs rather than domestic developments drove most of the rise in consumer prices. There is so far no sign of “a post-reopening surge in services inflation” according to Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy.</p><p>The stronger-than-expected wage numbers included in the labour-market statistics are also less startling than they seem. The Office for National Statistics (ons) reported that average regular pay growth was 4.6% in the three months to March. But the statisticians caution that the average is affected by a fall in the number of low-paid jobs compared with the pre-pandemic norm. Stripping out this compositional effect suggests that wages are growing by an underlying rate of 3%. Indeed, a recruitment website, reports little in the way of advertised wage growth for low-paid jobs.</p><p>Many hospitality bosses are fretting over a shortage of workers, but that industry is not typical. It has been especially hard hit by the departure of European immigrants and by the shifting economic geography caused by the rise in home working. Many potential hospitality workers are now in the wrong parts of the country. Modestly higher wage rates should help the market to readjust. A worker shortage seems unlikely to derail the recovery.</p><p>The recession of 2020 was not only the steepest for centuries but one of the oddest. The government absorbed much more of the economic hit than in a typical downturn through its furlough scheme, tax cuts and soft loans. Despite a fall of around 10% in gdp, unemployment never rose above 5.1%. Business insolvencies were rarer than in 2019.</p><p>Household balance sheets have seldom been healthier. Last year the household savings ratio—the percentage of disposable income that people save rather than consume—leapt to its highest level on record (see chart 1). Office workers found themselves saving a tidy sum on commuting costs and sandwich lunches, and had fewer opportunities to spend the extra money. Around £145bn (6.9% of gdp) was added to household bank accounts in 2020, although the Bank of England estimates that this rise was driven mostly by the highest earners.</p><p>How quickly the economy recovers will depend on what households choose to do with this hoard. Although overall consumption fell sharply in 2020 (see chart 2), transport and recreation activities accounted for most of the drop. Households are unlikely to make up for lost trips to the hairdresser in 2020 by getting their hair restyled more often in 2021, but they might pop out to the pub and restaurants a bit more than they did in 2019. Measures of consumer confidence point to a large bounce in spending. Services are likely to benefit from that.</p><p>Healthier bank balances should support higher spending this year even if the cash is not withdrawn. Consumers with higher than usual deposit levels ought to feel less compelled to put aside as much of their income as normal, reducing their flow of new savings and increasing their consumption. The National Institute for Economic and Social Affairs, a think-tank, forecasts gdp growth of 5.7% for 2021, assuming that the savings ratio falls to more normal levels. If households choose to spend the accumulated cash balances, niesr estimates that gdp growth could be around three percentage points higher.</p><p>Like a coiled spring, the British economy is bouncing as the government loosens restrictions. Pub and restaurant bosses in Stevenage, and across the country, are preparing for a summer of fun as people make up for lost opportunities. But for all the optimism, most analysts still expect the economy to be smaller at the end of the year than it was on the eve of the pandemic. That suggests there is still enough slack in the system to absorb rebounding demand. Britain’s economic summer looks likely to be typical of British summers in general: good fun, but accompanied by no great risk of overheating.</p><p><a id="why-the-best-farmland-in-britain-has-become-cheap"></a></p><h1 id="Why-the-best-farmland-in-Britain-has-become-cheap"><a href="#Why-the-best-farmland-in-Britain-has-become-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Why the best farmland in Britain has become cheap"></a>Why the best farmland in Britain has become cheap</h1><p>The most expensive land is bumpy and stony</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>By the middle of the 19th century East Anglia had become the breadbasket of Britain. Steam-powered water pumps and men with shovels had drained the land, leaving a rich, stoneless soil that was almost black in places. “What were once fens and sandbanks, bear now a luxuriant sea of corn and the highest of rents,” wrote Karl Marx of Lincolnshire. The soil thereabouts is still excellent. But Britain’s priciest farmland is elsewhere.</p><p>Before 2015 arable land was rising in price almost everywhere. Then came a slump in commodity prices, followed by the Brexit vote. Although many farmers supported the Leave campaign, they soon began to worry that the government would cut per-acre subsidies after departing the eu’s common agricultural policy. It proceeded to do just that in England; Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are not far behind. At which point the land market began to diverge, with the best farming areas performing worst (see chart).</p><p>Strutt &amp; Parker, an estate agent, has analysed arable farmland prices in two regions for The Economist. The first consists of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk—a flattish area with lots of land designated grade one or two (the highest grades on a five-point scale). The second area is the Cotswolds, defined as Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. Strutt &amp; Parker only counts sales of more than 100 acres (40 hectares) to get rid of pony paddocks and such like. It also strips out the value of buildings. The frequently hilly, mostly grade three land of the Cotswolds costs more than the fertile stuff.</p><p>Some purchasers in that region plan to plant trees, for which they may be rewarded by companies seeking to offset their carbon emissions. A few others are “rewilders” who hope to return the land to nature. That modish group is more common in Scotland, where land parcels are larger—the bigger the area of land, the more it can be left to manage itself.</p><p>Above all, though, the farmland market in the Cotswolds is driven by “lifestyle” buyers who seek a quiet place to live. They are mostly interested in the farmhouse, and view the fields around it (which are likely to be planted and harvested by a contract farmer) as a kind of verdant moat. Covid-19 has persuaded so many people of the virtues of isolation that lifestyle farm buyers are spilling well beyond the borders of the Cotswolds, where they have been present for years.</p><p>Their priorities are quite different from the yield-focused growers of eastern England. “The commercial farmer doesn’t care if the land is next to a motorway,” says Clive Hopkins of Knight Frank, another estate agent. Lifestyle farmers do. They also mind electricity pylons and footpaths running close to the farmhouse. Above all they seek beauty, which is where the breadbasket region often falls short. The great drainage projects of eastern England, which turned rude fens into a grid of neatly rectangular fields, aimed to make the land much more valuable. It does not look that way now.</p><p><a id="a-coronavirus-variant-is-spreading-in-britain%E2%80%94but-this-time-is-different"></a></p><h1 id="A-coronavirus-variant-is-spreading-in-Britain—but-this-time-is-different"><a href="#A-coronavirus-variant-is-spreading-in-Britain—but-this-time-is-different" class="headerlink" title="A coronavirus variant is spreading in Britain—but this time is different"></a>A coronavirus variant is spreading in Britain—but this time is different</h1><p>Mass vaccination means the damage will be limited</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Bolton’s vaccine bus plies the town’s southern neighbourhoods. On social media the doctors who run it advertise the fact that there is “Pfizer on the bus!” That vaccine is more popular locally than one made by AstraZeneca, which has been dogged by reports of extremely rare blood clots. Queues form as the bus rolls up to car parks outside mosques, schools and community centres.</p><p>A new variant of coronavirus was detected in India last year and arrived in Britain this spring. Cases have grown quickly in recent weeks, particularly in Bolton. The viral geneticists call it B.1.617.2. The media call it the “Indian variant”. The government’s scientific advisers believe that 617.2 is more infectious than the “Kent variant”, B.1.1.7, which drove Britain’s deadly second wave through January. Indeed, 617.2 has started to outcompete 1.1.7 (see chart).</p><p>It is doing so in a very different environment. Most Britons have received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine. Twenty million, most of them old or otherwise highly vulnerable, have had two. Any infection a vaccinated person does get is likely to be milder, meaning they are less likely to distribute the virus. So 617.2 will spread in a different manner to 1.1.7.</p><p>The majority of new cases being found in Britain are in teenagers. In the seven-day period to May 13th just four people per 100,000 aged between 85 and 89 tested positive in England. The equivalent number for 10-14 year olds was 46. Even though cases of 617.2 are growing proportionally, cases of coronavirus overall are flat. So are measures of hospitalisation and death. Whereas last week saw cases surge in Bolton and other places with clusters of infection, growth rates slowed through the beginning of this week and even declined in some areas.</p><p>The health service will struggle to deal with another covid-19 surge even if it comes with a lower rate of serious illness and death. Waiting lists for other conditions have grown long and staff morale is low. A surge would also pose risks to children’s education. Some schools in Bolton have already moved entire year groups back to online classes.</p><p>If the number of cases climbs, the government will face pressure to delay the relaxation of restrictions, and perhaps to implement local lockdowns. In the meantime Bolton’s vaccine bus has the right idea. It is focusing on getting jabs to areas of the city like Deane, Rumsworth and Great Lever. Data on vaccinations from Public Health England shows that those areas have far lower vaccine coverage than the average for Bolton or Britain. As of May 9th only 42% of people in Rumsworth aged 16 or older had taken a first dose of vaccine. The average across Britain is almost 70%. On May 15th Lynn Donkin, Bolton’s assistant director of public health, told the Bolton Hindu Forum that new cases are concentrated in those areas too.</p><p>Some blame vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minorities in south Bolton for this low uptake. There may be some truth to that, but those areas are also poorer than their surroundings, with shabbier public transport. Yasmin Qureshi, the Labour mp for Bolton south-east, has said that the only place for her constituents to get vaccinated until recently was a health centre in the city centre. That the bus now brings the vaccine to them is good.</p><p>The world should keep an eye on Britain’s struggle with 617.2. The outbreak in Bolton has already shown that uneven vaccine coverage can offer new variants a foothold. For as long as understanding of the virus and its variants remains murky, a risk remains that any foothold can become a platform for exponential growth. That threatens everyone.</p><p><a id="britain%E2%80%99s-civil-service-remains-upper-middle-class"></a></p><h1 id="Britain’s-civil-service-remains-upper-middle-class"><a href="#Britain’s-civil-service-remains-upper-middle-class" class="headerlink" title="Britain’s civil service remains upper-middle class"></a>Britain’s civil service remains upper-middle class</h1><p>Not so much has changed since the 1960s, a new report says</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The key, thought John Fulton, was to do away with the dominance of Oxbridge-educated generalists and promote officials with technical skills. It was 1968, and Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, worried that Whitehall was too institutionally conservative. He had commissioned the Fulton report with the aim of forging Britain into a science-fuelled meritocracy. One enraged traditionalist declared his preference to be ruled by men who had read Plato and Shakespeare rather than by nuclear scientists.</p><p>Boris Johnson also wants to turn Britain into a science superpower, and to make its government sound more like his new northern voters. The upper ranks of civil service have changed little, according to a report published on May 20th by the Social Mobility Commission ( smc), an advisory body. In 1967 some two-thirds of the senior civil service—the officials at the very top—came from what the authors call a “high socioeconomic background”, meaning their parents worked in fields like accountancy and engineering. Today the figure is 72%. The share whose parents did working-class jobs has changed only from 19% to 18%.</p><p>Direct comparisons with 1967 are tricky. There are many more women and ethnic minorities in top jobs, even though they face additional barriers. Britain’s working class has shrunk, so the potential recruiting pool for mandarins with blue-collar origins has too.</p><p>Still, the report speaks ministers’ language. Michael Gove, the minister for the cabinet, wants a civil service that is less southern, less middle-class, more open to scientists and more attuned to Brexit voters’ sensibilities. Efforts to move top jobs to cheaper cities might make it more socially diverse, since London’s high costs can deter those from poor families. The risk is that moving to mostly white towns will reduce ethnic diversity.</p><p>Culture may be trickier to shift than officials. The route to the top is a “velvet drainpipe” of plum jobs along which civil servants are guided by mentors who often promote in their own image, the report found. “The unwritten rules aren’t just hard to navigate; they’re narrow,” says Kate Josephs, the daughter of social workers from a mining town, who served as the director general of the Cabinet Office’s covid-19 task force. She felt conscious of her accent until she worked in America.</p><p>The smc proposes targets to improve class representation, as has been done for women and ethnic minorities. It also suggests making class discrimination illegal. Mr Gove has another idea: to close the status gap between policy officials, who draw up programmes like benefit reforms, and those who deliver them, like it engineers.</p><p>“Currently, the white-collar Whitehall mandarinate tends to treat more blue-collar operations officials like oily rags to be kept out of sight,” says Francis Maude, an ex-minister who has advised Mr Gove. Changing that could open new routes to the top of the civil service. Policy-focused departments like the Treasury are the poshest. Ones with lots of front-line staff such as the Department for Work and Pensions are the least so. </p><p><a id="how-to-do-foreign-policy-in-a-multi-ethnic-society"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-do-foreign-policy-in-a-multi-ethnic-society"><a href="#How-to-do-foreign-policy-in-a-multi-ethnic-society" class="headerlink" title="How to do foreign policy in a multi-ethnic society"></a>How to do foreign policy in a multi-ethnic society</h1><p>It is more complicated, but not necessarily worse</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Here are a few vignettes from Britain over the past week. Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the Israeli embassy, some shouting “Israel is a terror state”. A convoy of vehicles festooned with Palestinian flags drove into a heavily Jewish part of north London while a thug bellowed “fuck the Jews and rape their daughters”. Two Leicester City football players celebrated their victory in the fa Cup by unveiling a Palestinian flag. Many of these protesters belonged to Britain’s large Muslim population.</p><p>The fact that Britain is now a multi-ethnic society means that events abroad resonate more loudly than they used to. The invasion of Iraq under a Labour government infuriated many British Muslims. The fate of Kashmir is such a hot issue in Wycombe, in rural Buckinghamshire, that the local Tory mp has started the Conservative Friends of Kashmir. Classical statesmen did their best to protect foreign policy from democratic pressures in order to keep their eye, like Plato’s guardians, on the state’s long-term interests. Today foreign policy is buffeted not just by democratic pressures but by ethnic forces.</p><p>Political parties compete to win the votes of ethnic minorities, with foreign policy thrown into the bidding wars. The Conservative Party is mounting a challenge to Labour’s traditional hold over minorities, particularly in non-Muslim populations from the Indian subcontinent. Indian-origin voters favoured Labour over the Conservatives by only about five to four in the 2019 general election, compared with three to one among ethnic minorities as a whole. The government therefore has an interest in forging close relations with India even if that strains relations with Pakistan. It also means that party activists have an incentive to tell Indian-origin voters, sotto voce, that the Labour Party is a plaything of Muslims in general and Pakistan in particular.</p><p>Ethnic pressure-groups are multiplying. There are now 40 to 50 “friends” groups on the Tory side of the aisle and about the same number on the Labour side. The Conservative Friends of Israel has helped to turn the Tories from an instinctively pro-Arab party into a broadly pro-Israeli one. Now a second cfi, the Conservative Friends of India, is on the rise. It points to the growing number of Hindu faces in the upper ranks of the party such as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the home secretary, Priti Patel. It also hinted in 2019 that it could deliver 40 seats for the party.</p><p>There is much to fear in this. One is the balkanisation of foreign policy: designing policies to suit particular domestic interest groups. Another is raw emotion. The problems of Israel and Kashmir are complicated enough before they become intertwined with the local politics of north London or Bolton. A third is what Samuel Huntington called “the clash of civilisations”. The more Labour becomes identified with Muslims, and the Conservatives with Hindu and Israeli nationalism, the more wrenching conflicts will be reproduced in Britain’s constituencies.</p><p>How can policymakers avoid such disasters while acknowledging that Britain has been transformed by mass immigration? It is easy to say that politicians must pursue the national interest rather than the sectional interests of ethnic groups. But what is the national interest but the sum of the interests of all the country’s citizens? If the composition of those citizens changes then so does that interest. Ethnic groups have a perfect right to organise and agitate. And Britain’s regional interest in India and Pakistan (and Kashmir) is surely shaped by the fact that millions of British citizens have strong family connections there.</p><p>It is also easy enough to say that policymakers should avoid seeing policy through the eyes of particular groups. But another danger comes from doing the opposite: seeing all foreign policy as an extension of domestic struggles. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s former leader, who appeared on the national stage this week standing next to an inflatable figure with a hooked nose, is a leading offender. He sees groups such as Palestinians and Kashmiris as the global equivalents of the British working classes, a homogeneous mass of the oppressed rather than particular peoples operating in particular contexts. Some Brexiteers make the same mistake by positing a global struggle between the forces of rising nationalism on the one hand and a retreating globalism on the other.</p><p>Farewell, dear friends<br>Foreign-policymakers need to update their skills for a new age: for example, they need to be more sensitive to the importance of cultural ties and the power of religion. But they also need to make vigorous use of some of the oldest tools in the diplomatic box, notably objectivity and scepticism. They should pour cold water on ethnic passions even while recognising the power of those passions. They also need to cut self-proclaimed community leaders and “friends” organisations down to size, for neither is truly representative. Most ethnic communities are divided about foreign policy: many British Jews oppose Israel’s policy in the West Bank while many young Muslims ignore the elderly imams who claim to speak on behalf of their faith. Some friends organisations are controlled by factions with a very particular take on the domestic policies of the countries they claim to represent. Others are little more than a handful of lobbyists and a letterhead.</p><p>There is also reason for cautious optimism. The country’s ethnic minorities ought to be important resources for “global Britain” as it turns from Europe to Asia. Who better to forge closer trading ties than people who can speak the local language and who have family ties with local trading groups? Norman Tebbit, a Conservative cabinet minister in the 1980s, coined his “cricket test” in the name of division: he wanted to see where people’s loyalties lay. But cricket also provides an example of the opposite. A game that was invented by an imperial nation is played by Hindus, Muslims and dozens of other ethnic and religious groups who put aside their differences and observe a common set of rules. </p><p><a id="international---how-the-pandemic-has-upended-the-lives-of-working-parents"></a></p><h1 id="International-—How-the-pandemic-has-upended-the-lives-of-working-parents"><a href="#International-—How-the-pandemic-has-upended-the-lives-of-working-parents" class="headerlink" title="(International)—How the pandemic has upended the lives of working parents"></a>(International)—How the pandemic has upended the lives of working parents</h1><p>Women have the most to lose</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“On some days everything gets totally out of hand,” sighs Katharina Boesche, a German self-employed lawyer and mother of three. Fourteen months of closures and semi-closures of her daughters’ schools have taken a toll. She mostly works late at night or between 4am and 8am—when the house is quiet. The girls have coped with online learning, she says, but the seven-year-old needs a lot of supervision. Their school, like most in Germany, is only welcoming them back part-time. Mrs Boesche is stressed and exhausted.</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic countries have on average closed schools for 29 weeks, 17 of them full-time, according to unesco, the un’s cultural agency. Most have begun to open their doors once again. But life is far from normal. In Europe and North America only four in ten children live in a country where schools are open full-time and in person. Most students are still struggling with some degree of virtual learning—as are those taking care of them.</p><p>The past year will have lasting consequences for some working parents. It will also affect their families, their employers and the economy. Careerwise, mothers of young children are particularly at risk of being left behind, either because they have stopped working outside the home or because the pandemic has forced them to step back professionally. By January 2021 in America 1.5m fewer mothers with children under 13 were in work than a year earlier, an 8% drop. This was far worse than the figure for women in general (5.3%), men (5.1%) or fathers with similar kids (5.6%).</p><p>Since then some mothers (and plenty of fathers) have returned, but mothers of small children who do not have a bachelor’s degree remain more likely than any other group to have lost their job. If an “office gap” develops, with dads going back to the office and mums largely staying at home, disparities that have emerged during the pandemic will widen.</p><p>Today most children in America and Europe grow up in dual-income homes. Around a fifth live with just one parent. Even before the pandemic such households often struggled to juggle child care with paid work. The daily free child care of school helped a lot.</p><p>Covid-19 whipped it away. By April 2020 parents in couples in Britain were each doing on average an additional 3.5 hours of child care and 1.7 hours of home schooling a day, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank in London. Before the pandemic by 7pm on weeknights seven in ten parents were enjoying some time off; by March 2021 fewer than three in ten were able to relax. In America Latina and black mothers, who are more likely to be single or have a partner working outside the home, were almost twice as likely as white mothers to take on all child care and housework once covid-19 hit, says McKinsey, a consultancy.</p><p>The upheaval has affected parents’ mental health. The American Psychological Association (apa) found that parents were significantly more likely than non-parents to be diagnosed with a mental-health disorder during the pandemic. Before covid-19 Britons living with children were at no greater risk of mental-health issues, says Elise Paul of University College London. But during the pandemic they have struggled with higher levels of anxiety, loneliness, stress (including financial) and symptoms of depression.</p><p>Taking charge of their children’s education while working was a large part of this. “Am completely, utterly fucked off with ‘home schooling’,” wrote one poster on Mumsnet, a British parenting forum, one evening in February. Her home computer could run Teams but lacked a camera; her iPad had a camera but could not run Teams; she needed her company laptop for work and it could not run the right programmes either. Dozens of similarly exasperated parents responded. At quarter to midnight another mother, sitting up with an anxious 10-year-old, summed up their collective feelings: “I am clutching at my sanity.”</p><p>With each announcement of school closures the Mumsnet “swearometer”—which measures the number of obscenities in posts—spiked (see chart 1). In January, at its pandemic peak, over seven in ten Mumsnetters said they were failing both their employers and their children. Nine in ten concluded that working while looking after young kids was impossible.</p><p>The reopening of schools has provided some relief. By May, when in-person teaching had resumed in Britain, the swearometer had calmed down. But the psychological scars of the past year, the fear that schools might suddenly close, and stresses about job security and child safety, mean that for many the struggle is not over.</p><p>A scolding from teachers about her son’s failure to complete his assignments tipped Hayley, a 29-year-old single mother from Lincolnshire in England, “over the edge”. She feels lonely, angry and anxious. She has received no help with her mental health from Britain’s National Health Service despite asking repeatedly. She lost her job as a waitress in August. Her youngest son is only at nursery part-time, which makes looking for a job even harder.</p><p>In an American study parents who lost their job and their income during the pandemic said that they were much more stressed and depressed than parents who lost their jobs but still had money coming in (often thanks to government support). They also said that they were more likely to yell at their offspring or lose their tempers. Psychological distress in parents can affect children’s behaviour, says Cathy Creswell, a clinical psychologist at Oxford who saw an increase in such traits as hyperactivity in children in the first lockdown.</p><p>Mothers have suffered most. Ben Etheridge and Lisa Spantig of the University of Essex found that in the first months of Britain’s lockdown women’s well-being dropped twice as much as men’s. That some friendships have withered and others have never bloomed could have a lasting impact on new mothers in particular, predicts Margaret Kerr of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p>“I never realised how much interactions at work, like going out for lunch or having adult conversations, fulfilled my social life,” says Alissa, a mother of three from Washington state. Throughout the pandemic she has had several tearful breakdowns and has snapped at her kids—unusual for her. She is most looking forward to “having alone time at work so when I come home I can be a better mom.”</p><p>Mothers reported greater deterioration in their mental health but in the apa’s Stress in America survey fathers were more likely to say they boozed more, put on weight and slept poorly. One in two fathers with young children turned to alcohol to cope, more than any other group.</p><p>The working wounded<br>Careers are hurting too. Some parents have had to choose between leaving children unattended or quitting a front-line job. Others volunteered to take part in job-retention schemes, took leave, or were laid off. “The second wave broke caregivers’ backs,’‘ says Matt Krentz of bcg, a consultancy. In America, unlike during past recessions, women—especially those with children—bore the brunt of job losses (see chart 2), in part because of the sectors they work in. The global female workforce shrank by 3.3% in 2020, compared with a 1.7% decline for men, according to the International Labour Organisation.</p><p>Parents who could work from home tried to multitask their way through, often at the cost of their productivity, sanity or both. Dutch parents reported that about two-thirds of the time they were working at home they were also looking after children. In Britain mothers were twice as likely as fathers to be disrupted, mostly by their children, while working from home. In America those working remotely who also had child-care duties were three times more likely to turn down a big assignment than those who did not. Mothers were more likely than fathers to cut their hours.</p><p>Some damage to careers will come as a result of employers unfairly penalising parents, overlooking them for big projects, say. But those with children have also been less able to invest in their careers than those without. The 12 minutes a day that British parents spent studying before the pandemic plummeted to just one minute; for people without kids it fell from 16 to 12 minutes. Failing to learn new skills may mean parents miss out on future promotions and end up with smaller pensions.</p><p>Academics with young children have spent less time on their own research during the pandemic. The impact will last for years. Unless universities adjust their promotion policies, those with child-care responsibilities will be less likely to secure tenure. This affects women “a lot more than men”, says Matthias Doepke, an economist at Northwestern University.</p><p>Mr Krentz worries about women in middle management. Many have young children. If they fall behind professionally, the already small pool of potential female bosses will shrink. This could reverse some of the “tenuous progress” women have made in the workplace, he fears.</p><p>Highly educated women, who tend to be able to work from home, have struggled to juggle their jobs and child care. Mothers who cannot work remotely have been far more likely to drop out altogether. In America the imbalance in job losses between men and women has been almost entirely driven by women who could not work remotely, according to a working paper, co-authored by Professor Doepke and published in April by the National Bureau of Economic Research.</p><p>South Korea offers a grim example. Schools there closed for only five weeks last year, but since then 10- to 18-year-olds have spent several days a week learning virtually at home and there have been sporadic local closures. Kim Na-yeon, a mother of two, says the hardest part is the ongoing uncertainty. Nearly two-thirds of Korean parents polled in March said they struggled to find child care. Of those, three-quarters of women and nearly half of men had considered resigning. The army of South Korean housewives, which had in previous years been decreasing, grew by 5% in the year to February 2021.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, access to affordable care was a problem for employers, with child-care-related absences and increased staff turnover costing companies billions a year, according to the us Chamber of Commerce Foundation. But covid-19 is making the problem worse. In America more than three-quarters of health-care employers who saw workers leave during the pandemic say that child care was a factor. Half of parents who had not returned to work by November last year cited child care as a reason. “If I were an employer I’d find a way to get people back without it having to be 100 hours a week,” says Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University.</p><p>Some are trying. Mercer, a consultancy, says the fourfold increase in child-care-related inquiries it saw during the pandemic shows no sign of slowing down as schools reopen. Many employers tout “flexible working” as a perk. But support for working parents—such as paid leave and help with child care—is still a rare privilege.</p><p>Zalando, a German fashion platform, boasts of its new initiatives for parents, including online emergency tutoring for their children. It does not offer such benefits to its warehouse workers. The New York Times found that in America 29% of high-income workers with a postgraduate degree had been offered paid time off during lockdown; just 9% of those without a college degree did. One in five highly educated workers received payments from their employers towards child care or tutoring; only one in 20 less-educated workers did.</p><p>Better when we’re together<br>There have been silver linings. Parents and children have spent more time together, shared more hugs and played together more, according to Equitable Growth, a non-profit organisation in Washington, dc. In Britain working-class parents—who were more likely to lose their jobs or be furloughed—spent slightly more time helping their children with home schooling than middle-class parents. In America mothers who lost their jobs but retained their income reported better relationships with their children. Some families even thrived. “They have become so independent,” beams Catherine, an American mother of five, vowing that she will henceforth give her children more freedom.</p><p>It is too soon to tell whether all this will cause a shift in parenting styles. Some experts hope it will reduce the amount of “helicopter” parenting. Sheer exhaustion has lowered expectations and relaxed attitudes to screen time, at least temporarily.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest question is how the past year will affect the way parents divvy up responsibility. Early in the pandemic men stepped up. When schools first shut British fathers were almost as likely as mothers to be involved in home schooling. But by late January 2021 only half were educating their offspring, compared with two-thirds of mothers. In March 2020 mothers did one-and-a-half times more child care than fathers; by September they were doing twice as much. Couples seem to be reverting to an old-fashioned form of specialisation, with men bringing home the bacon and women frying it—while listening to a Zoom call with a baby on their hip.</p><p>From a couple’s perspective, such a division of labour can make sense. Women tend to earn less than their male partners, partly because the men are often older and so likely to earn more. So the loss of their (future) income will cost their families less. The lower-earning partner is also more likely to abandon work when children have to self-isolate.</p><p>But what makes sense for couples could widen the gap between the sexes. Some researchers speculate about a “conservative shift”, where societies faced with a big threat—such as a terrorist attack or economic collapse—revert to traditional roles. Anne Boring and Gloria Moroni of Sciences Po and Erasmus University found that in France attitudes towards gender regressed during the country’s first lockdown, particularly among the parents of under-12s, men and poorer households. Men became more likely to say that men make better political leaders. Both men and women with young children became more likely to believe a woman’s job is to look after the family. Such norms are linked with lower levels of female workforce participation. And once women drop out of the workforce they are slower to return than men.</p><p>One thing has improved undeniably. For parents whose jobs can be done anywhere with a computer and a Wi-Fi connection, work has become unimaginably more flexible. This has been a boon for millions of mothers. If all workers take advantage of these new freedoms, the pandemic could mark the start of a better chapter for working parents (of the white-collar variety at least). Women are less willing to endure lengthy commutes, so remote working may open a wider range of jobs to them.</p><p>Curb your enthusiasm<br>But employers are less keen to talk about another scenario. What if videoconferencing becomes an excuse not to fix inadequate child and social care? What if remote working turns offices into “man-caves”, as one academic puts it, as mothers feel under pressure to work from home because they can? What if “flexibility” leads to a two-tier workforce with insiders, who can work whenever and wherever needed, and outsiders who can’t? “If women specialise in working from home and men in office work, there is a risk that decades of progress in reducing traditional gender roles are reversed,” says Claudia Hupkau, an economist at cunef University in Madrid.</p><p>A forthcoming paper by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University finds that among Britons searching for a new job, women are 29% more likely than men to be doing so because they want to work from home more. In America surveys by Nick Bloom and colleagues at Stanford University show that working mothers of young children want to spend the most time working from home after the pandemic. Working fathers want to spend the least, even less than men without kids. “Perhaps they want to avoid the noise?” suggests Professor Bloom (a father of four).</p><p>In Washington Alissa’s children are back at school—some of the time. They go four days a week from 8:30am to 11:25am and then come home to study online. She is grateful that her work schedule is flexible. She is trying to stay positive. “It’s slowly getting better but I don’t think it will ever go back to how it used to be.” That may or may not turn out to be a good thing. </p><p><a id="business---the-warner-discovery-deal-and-the-future-of-streaming"></a></p><h1 id="Business-—The-Warner-Discovery-deal-and-the-future-of-streaming"><a href="#Business-—The-Warner-Discovery-deal-and-the-future-of-streaming" class="headerlink" title="(Business)—The Warner-Discovery deal and the future of streaming"></a>(Business)—The Warner-Discovery deal and the future of streaming</h1><p>To survive online, media firms are combining</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>One of the biggest hits of recent years on Discovery’s cable television network is “90 Day Fiancé”, a reality show that follows the fortunes of couples in America on k-1 visas. A condition of the visa is that the pair must marry within three months, or else leave the country. Many of the show’s romances are rocky. But the couples—and riveted viewers—realise that, unless they tie the knot in time, deportation awaits.</p><p>On May 17th Discovery announced that it was to form a marriage of necessity of its own, joining forces with WarnerMedia, which is to be spun off from its owner, at&amp;t, a telecoms giant. Combined, the two companies will form the world’s second-largest media group by revenue, behind only Disney. Their hope is that this scale will allow them to survive an existential battle for viewers that makes “Godzilla vs. Kong” look like cautious cuddling.</p><p>The announcement is a Hollywood plot twist for show business. It has already caused speculation about further mergers, as panicked media companies seek their own partners before it is too late. Some may already have missed their moment.</p><p>At first sight Warner and Discovery make an odd couple. The first specialises in high-quality tv series and films, such as “Game of Thrones” or the Godzilla-Kong saga, whereas the second serves up cheap factual fare. Yet their different programming, and the sheer quantity of it, ought to help them appeal to a wider audience. The $19bn that the two spent on content last year was more than either Disney or Netflix (see chart). The new firm will also have the biggest share of American cable viewers. Its channels accounted for 29% of viewing time last year, according to MoffettNathanson, a research firm, which expects it to use its heft to negotiate better affiliate fees and ad rates. The merged firm expects to save $3bn a year in costs.</p><p>For at&amp;t, the deal represents an admission that its expensive foray into entertainment has flopped. It bought Time Warner in 2016 at an enterprise value of $110bn, later changing its name to WarnerMedia. The previous year it had purchased Directv, a satellite-television firm, at an enterprise value of $67bn. The idea was to vertically integrate the businesses of content creation and distribution. But the liaison proved an unhappy one. And while regulators delayed the Time Warner acquisition by two years, Disney and other rivals gained ground.</p><p>In February at&amp;t began to unwind its position, spinning out Directv in a deal that valued the division at just $16bn. By hiving off WarnerMedia it will receive the equivalent of $43bn upfront, in a mix of cash, securities and transferred debt. As well as this, at&amp;t shareholders will own 71% of the new company, with Discovery’s shareholders getting the rest. The deal values WarnerMedia at about $100bn, meaning that under at&amp;t its value has stagnated even as other media giants grew fast.</p><p>The new company is to be run by Discovery’s boss, David Zaslav, leaving no place for Jason Kilar, who was hired a year ago to run WarnerMedia. Mr Kilar, whose background is in technology, had gone all out to push hbo Max, Warner’s streaming service. In December he said that all of this year’s releases from the Warner Bros studio would be available for streaming at the same time that they entered cinemas. Hollywood traditionalists were scandalised; many now feel some satisfaction. “at&amp;t backstabs its own hatchet man” ran a headline in Variety, an industry magazine.</p><p>The shotgun wedding may be awkward, but it is necessary. Competition in streaming, already brutal, is about to become more so. The lockdowns of 2020 provided a captive audience. Total media-consumption time increased by 12% between the second and fourth quarters of last year, according to a nine-country survey by midia Research, a firm of analysts. The average American household subscribed to four streaming services. As the world opens up people will spend less time in front of the box. Consumer spending on video media shrank by 2% year on year in the first quarter, according to Groupm, a giant in the business of placing adverts on behalf of clients. In recent weeks Netflix and Disney, the leading streamers, have both missed forecasts for subscriber growth.</p><p>To compete in this environment, says Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson, a streaming service needs four things: scale at home, high-quality content, a flexible balance-sheet to pay for it and, to help spread the costs, the ability to expand globally. With a compelling catalogue and a solid presence in America, hbo Max ticks the first two boxes. But at&amp;t’s sickly balance-sheet has made it hard to keep up with the likes of Netflix in spending on shows. And having chosen to license content to distributors in other countries, such as Sky in Britain, rather than set up shop abroad, its international footprint is puny.</p><p>The Discovery deal helps to tackle both of these problems. Warner will no longer be beholden to at&amp;t’s balance-sheet, although the new firm will start life with hefty debts of its own. And Discovery+ is already up and running in Europe and India. This earns the combined company a place in the top tier of streamers, alongside Netflix, Disney and Amazon, says Mr Nathanson. Amazon is looking to shore up its position, and is reportedly in talks to buy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (mgm), the studio behind the James Bond films, for $9bn (see Schumpeter). Last year it spent $11bn on video and music content, 40% more than in 2019. With 175m viewers it is not far behind Netflix’s tally of 208m—though many rarely watch, subscribing instead for shopping discounts and other benefits.</p><p>Where does that leave the rest? Some are scrambling to form mergers of their own. On the same day that the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, two big French broadcasters, tf1 and m6, said they would join forces, arguing that together they could provide an “ambitious French response” to competition from international streamers. The deal must first satisfy regulators; the two firms control three-quarters of the French tv-advertising market. Brian Wieser of Groupm expects more consolidation in Europe. He highlights BritBox, owned by Britain’s bbc and itv, and tvNow, owned by rtl, a European group, as services that will require considerably bigger investments if they are to be truly competitive.</p><p>Of the larger American firms, Apple tv+ has yet to take off, despite giving away subscriptions left, right and centre (more than 60% of its 40m or so users are reckoned to be on free trials). It has not registered any big hits so far, but it has oodles of cash with which to buy some if it chooses; Apple executives reportedly looked at mgm before Amazon swooped in.</p><p>Strutting their stuff<br>nbcUniversal, which is owned by Comcast, a cable giant, and last year launched its Peacock streaming service, and Viacomcbs, which recently unveiled its own equivalent, Paramount+, are in a sticky position. Their competing television interests would make it difficult for them to merge. They could buy other media properties that have not already been snapped up, such as amc Networks, which owns several entertainment channels, or Lionsgate, the studio behind films like “The Hunger Games” and tv shows like “Mad Men”. But none of these assets alone would help a company to leap to global scale. Those that have not already arranged their nuptials may face the corporate equivalent of unceremonious deportation. </p><p><a id="china%E2%80%99s-communist-party-chips-away-at-hong-kong-business-houses"></a></p><h1 id="China’s-Communist-Party-chips-away-at-Hong-Kong-business-houses"><a href="#China’s-Communist-Party-chips-away-at-Hong-Kong-business-houses" class="headerlink" title="China’s Communist Party chips away at Hong Kong business houses"></a>China’s Communist Party chips away at Hong Kong business houses</h1><p>The territory’s tycoons are falling out of favour</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>To get a sense of how Hong Kong’s magnates and China’s Communist Party have coexisted, consider Tung Chee-hwa. When his family shipping concern, Orient Overseas Container Line (oocl), faced bankruptcy in the mid-1980s, a Chinese state-owned bank swooped in to bail it out. Mr Tung became the territory’s chief executive after Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, until protests pushed him out of office in 2005. In 2017 he cashed out of oocl through a $6.3bn sale to Cosco, another state-owned giant.</p><p>Closeness to power has characterised the entrepot’s business elites for decades. The relationship hinged on the “high-land-price policy”, an informal agreement to constrict the supply of land and guarantee high returns for bosses and the state alike. Taxes on property and property developers generated 45% of government revenues between 1970 and 1996 for the colonial authorities. Post-colonial ones benefited from it, too. For the tycoons the arrangement helped transform land holdings into sprawling conglomerates that now touch most aspects of life in the city.</p><p>The tycoons might have hoped the entente would help them in the pandemic, which has hit their businesses hard. Sun Hung Kai Properties and New World Development, real-estate empires controlled by the Kwok and Cheng families, respectively, saw their profits fall by 25-50% in the last financial year. Hang Lung Properties, another big developer, reported a net loss of $280m. Swire, which controls assets including Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flag-carrier, lost $1.4bn as covid-19 grounded air travel; the airline’s share price hit a 20-year low in August. The shares of Hongkong Land, a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson, another family-held empire that includes Mandarin Oriental hotels, have lost 36% of their value since March 2019.</p><p>Ronnie Chan, Hang Lung’s outspoken chairman, summed up the rapport in his group’s latest annual report: “I see no incentive for Beijing to hurt us.” But Beijing’s incentives appear to be changing. The Communist Party is reducing the tycoons’ influence on the election committees which select the territory’s political leaders, where business clans were allotted strong representation after the handover in 1997. It has tightened its grip on Hong Kong, most recently with a national-security law that is stripping the city of many freedoms and putting its status as a global commercial hub in question. Most important, pro-Beijing business interests are drawing up plans to loosen the families’ grip on land supply, which remains the bedrock of their commercial empires.</p><p>Since the handover, tycoons have in effect controlled about a quarter of the appointments to the election committee that chooses the territory’s top leader. In a controversial move in March the Chinese government overhauled the system, depriving business elites of a tenth of their votes and barring anyone deemed “unpatriotic” from holding office. The 300 new seats that have been added will mainly go to pro-China business patriots.</p><p>Hong Kong’s government insists the reform will make elections fairer. One pro-Beijing businessman says this assertion—absurd on its face since the changes bar pro-democracy candidates—hints at the authorities’ desire to shift the balance of power away from the business lobby.</p><p>The security crackdown presents a more direct threat to the tycoons’ commercial interests. When Cathay Pacific did not condemn protesters in 2019, Chinese state media said the airline would “pay a painful price”. Its staff were later reportedly harassed by Chinese authorities and flights were unnecessarily delayed at mainland airports. Pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong and mainland mouthpieces have in recent years lambasted Li Ka-shing, the city’s mightiest tycoon, for his ambiguous stance on the protests; some have circulated an image of the 92-year-old’s face pasted onto the body of a cockroach.</p><p>Mr Li’s businesses, which span ports, telecoms and much else besides, have escaped chiefly because he has been diversifying his holdings away from Hong Kong and mainland China. Others got Beijing’s message. Swire, Jardine Matheson and many big developers backed the nationalsecurity law last year.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest danger has come in the form of an internal paper circulated in March within the Bauhinia Party, a political group formed in 2020 by mainland-Chinese businessmen. This argues that Hong Kong’s high property prices threaten China’s security, echoing those who attribute the city’s gaping inequality and recent unrest directly to developers’ control over land. It says the central government in Beijing has the right to co-ordinate the supply of land in the city and could create new housing for 200,000 residents over the next five years.</p><p>One way of doing that would be for the government to expropriate farmland held by developers to build public housing. Just three large developers—Sun Hung Kai Properties, New World Development and Henderson Land Development, which is controlled by the Lee family—hold about 17.5% of Hong Kong’s total farmland. That puts them at greatest risk should the government take such steps, says David Blennerhassett of Smartkarma, a research firm.</p><p>Expropriations may violate local law. But laws can be changed, as the imposition of new security and electoral rules show. Such an outcome looks “all too believable”, says Mr Blennerhassett. The tycoons thought “they didn’t have to do anything as long as they didn’t question Beijing”, says Joseph Fan of Chinese University of Hong Kong. Now the Communist Party will not even settle for overt expressions of fealty. It appears intent on extracting value, too.</p><p><a id="how-to-thrive-in-the-shadow-of-giants"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-thrive-in-the-shadow-of-giants"><a href="#How-to-thrive-in-the-shadow-of-giants" class="headerlink" title="How to thrive in the shadow of giants"></a>How to thrive in the shadow of giants</h1><p>Smaller companies are snapping at the heels of the tech titans</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Acouple of years ago Snap, the company behind Snapchat, a social-media app, came close to imitating the feature for which it was then famous: digital photos that self-destruct ten seconds after the recipient views them. Shortly after a headline-grabbing initial public offering in 2017, the firm faced a user revolt triggered by an unpopular redesign, falling rates after it started automatically auctioning ad space and an exodus of executives. Its shares dropped precipitously in value, at one point in late 2018 sinking below $5, less than a fifth of the price they fetched when the firm started trading.</p><p>Snap has since staged one of the greatest turnarounds in tech history. When it reported its latest quarterly results in April, it pleasantly surprised analysts again, just as it has for the past few quarters. Revenue grew by 66% from a year earlier, to $770m. The number of daily users reached 280m, an addition of more than 50m over the same period. The firm’s share price has surged by 208% in the past 12 months, to $54. “The pandemic exposed the resilience of the changes we have made,” says Evan Spiegel, Snap’s boss.</p><p>The comeback reveals a broader trend. While the largest Western tech companies have had a blowout first quarter, firms that fall in the category below—call them “tier-two tech”—are growing briskly, too. And it is not just the extra digital demand generated by the pandemic that is making all boats rise, or the fact that it is easier for smaller firms to grow. Some second-tier companies are confounding sceptics who claimed it was impossible to thrive in the shadow of the industry’s titans.</p><p>By any reasonable definition, the universe of biggish listed tech companies is large. In America it includes hundreds of firms. We have defined as “tier-two” those with a market value of no less than $20bn that were incorporated in 2000 or later. That leaves 42 firms worth a combined $2.4trn. They range from e-commerce sites and streaming services to travel firms and vendors of corporate applications.</p><p>Even before the pandemic this group had added some weight relative to “gafam”, as some now call America’s five tech behemoths (Google and its parent company Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft). In February 2020 its joint market capitalisation amounted to 22% of gafam’s, up from 14% three years earlier (see chart).</p><p>One reason for the increase in relative size in America is technological progress, especially the rise of cloud computing. This has allowed firms to specialise and created big markets even for seemingly obscure products and services, which can now be tailored for narrow purposes and offered globally. “The investments we made back in 2017 are now paying off,” says Mr Spiegel.</p><p>A good example is Twilio. The firm is largely unknown to consumers, but used by most. It provides services for text, voice and video communication to more than 200,000 other firms, from Airbnb, a home-sharing site, to Zendesk, a help-desk service. After a few years of fast growth, its annual revenue is approaching $2bn and its market capitalisation exceeds $50bn. “If you are a developer, you don’t have to spend a year to understand all the details. You can just plug into our systems,” explains Jeff Lawson, Twilio’s boss, “that’s the idea of infrastructure-as-a-service.”</p><p>The pandemic has given the second tier a further boost. At its peak it was worth 35% of the big five (although that has fallen to 29%, as investors have cooled on newish tech stocks). This pattern in America of a weightier second tier has parallels in China, where a new generation of tech darlings, including Meituan and Pinduoduo, has come of age to take on the duopoly of Alibaba and Tencent. “Covid has been the great digital accelerator,” says Mr Lawson.</p><p>Demand for Twilio’s services, for instance enabling salespeople to communicate electronically with customers, shot up when physical retailers had to move online. Many other second-tier tech firms benefited, too. Zoom, a now near-ubiquitous videoconferencing service, saw its revenue surge to $882m in the latest quarter, nearly a five-fold increase on a year earlier. Revenues of Shopify, an e-commerce platform, more than doubled. Most of the other 40 firms in our sample grew by double digits or more. Besides Snap, these include Pinterest, another social-media firm (78%), and PayPal, a provider of online payments (29%).</p><p>The techlash has helped, too. Under scrutiny from critics and regulators, gafam mostly shied away from big takeovers (with the notable exception of Microsoft, which recently bought Nuance, which makes speech-recognition and other software, for $16bn and was rumoured to be in talks with Pinterest). This in turn has pushed more tier-two firms to go public. Of the 42, no fewer than 13 did so in 2019 and 2020, adding about $600bn to the group’s current collective market capitalisation.</p><p>The second tier have succeeded mainly by getting better at creating protected space for themselves to grow, says Mark Mahaney of Evercore isi, an investment bank. They not only offer compelling products but have built, in geek speak, “platforms”, complete with an “ecosystem” of users and corporate partners on top.</p><p>Platforms are best thought of as a marketplace, where the operator provides some basic services that enable buyers and sellers to transact. They often exhibit strong “network effects”: more buyers attract more merchants, which attract more buyers and so on. Such setups also make it harder for one of the giants to ape rival products, as Microsoft has done with Slack or Apple with Spotify.</p><p>Take Snap. It was straightforward for Facebook to copy Snapchat’s hallmark feature, called “Stories”. These were just collections of pictures and videos captured within the past 24 hours. So the firm has instead recast “Stories” as a platform on which curated partners, such as big media companies, can offer original content. Snapchat’s four other main offerings are conceived as platforms, too. For example, users of “Map” can locate their friends and local hotspots, and “Camera” lets tens of thousands of developers offer digital filters for users’ cameras.</p><p>Several more tier-two firms have also erected robust platforms. “Shopify does not compete with Amazon. We are not a retailer. We are a piece of software that powers other brands,” explains Harley Finkelstein, the company’s president. Instead of selling stuff for other firms, in other words, the site provides them with tools to set up their own virtual stores, from web hosting to payment, and allows third-party companies to offer additional services, including design and delivery.</p><p>Build it and they will come<br>Similarly, the more users and merchants PayPal and other payments firms like Square and Stripe attract, the more useful they become to everyone. Twilio’s corporate customers and developers of more specialised communication applications, such as call-centre software and group texting, likewise feed off each other.</p><p>Others are trying to spin up their own “flywheels”, as the digital virtuous circles are known. Spotify and Twitter want to fulfil this function for anyone producing digital works. The first now sees itself as a home for all sorts of audio content, from songs to podcasts. The second mainly aims to distribute all manner of written content, including tweets and newsletters. Zoom, for its part, in October introduced “Zapps” (later renamed “Zoom Apps”). These, much like the lenses on Snapchat and the applications on Twilio, are supposed to form a moat that both keeps rivals at a safe distance and creates additional demand.</p><p>Not all this platform-building will succeed. But where it does, the builders could yet catch up with gafam, at least if tech history is a guide.</p><p>In China Meituan and Pinduoduo, two e-commerce platforms, have overtaken Baidu to become the third- and fourth-largest internet firms in China. Only a few years ago Adobe and Salesforce, two providers of corporate applications (which are both too old to be included in our sample), were still much smaller than Oracle and sap, leaders in business software, let alone Microsoft. Adobe and Salesforce still have lower revenues than Oracle and sap. But they are growing faster and are now in the same league in terms of market capitalisation, currently worth $229bn and $204bn, respectively, compared with $227bn for Oracle and $168bn for sap.</p><p>“S” is the most likely letter to be added to the gafam acronym. In its new incarnation, Snap may yet become a serious rival to Facebook. Snapchat is now arguably the closest the West has to a “super-app” (the model is WeChat, Tencent’s flagship platform). If it keeps buying biggish companies, meanwhile, Salesforce could one day pull even with Microsoft. And if it continues on its current trajectory long enough, more wares may one day be sold on Shopify than on Amazon.</p><p>Much has to go right for this to happen. One risk is that the tech sell-off of the past few weeks makes it harder for loss-making firms to raise capital, or maintain the enthusiasm of shareholders for heavy losses in the pursuit of growth. Over three-fifths of the second tier lose money. The titans will have to become less innovative, the reason Oracle and sap have seen their lead eroded. Many of the second-tier tech firms will need to be willing to merge. And trustbusters will have to tackle gafam’s dominance. “Unless the regulatory environment really changes, this is going to be the status quo for the foreseeable future,” argues Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, an investment firm.</p><p>Instead of waiting for a second-tier firm to grow into a gafam-sized beast, it may be more realistic to expect an ecosystem like the biological one, in which species of all sizes find their niche. Dinosaurs occasionally die out. But that happens rarely, and mostly through outside intervention.</p><p><a id="amazon%E2%80%99s-future-beyond-jeff-bezos"></a></p><h1 id="Amazon’s-future-beyond-Jeff-Bezos"><a href="#Amazon’s-future-beyond-Jeff-Bezos" class="headerlink" title="Amazon’s future beyond Jeff Bezos"></a>Amazon’s future beyond Jeff Bezos</h1><p>Could an MGM deal be the CEO’s parting shot?</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In the early days of Amazon, its founder, Jeff Bezos, insisted there was some advertising the e-commerce giant wouldn’t touch, such as guns. That extended to James Bond’s Walther ppk. When producers of “Skyfall”, a Bond film released in 2012, sought to run an ad on the site, Amazon at first informed them that it violated the company’s weapons policy. “The studio was like ‘screw you!’” an Amazon executive later recalled. “Who is James Bond in silhouette without a gun? Literally, he’s just a random dude.”</p><p>This anecdote, one of innumerable gems in Brad Stone’s latest book, “Amazon Unbound”, springs to mind amid reports that Amazon is in talks to acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (mgm), part-owner of the Bond franchise, for $9bn. The book, by one of the company’s most astute observers, helps answer a question many are pondering as arguably the world’s most accomplished businessman prepares to surrender his role as ceo this summer. Will the Seattle-based e-commerce and cloud-computing juggernaut, whose revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of over 40% for more than two decades, lose momentum without its dome-headed, maths-geek mastermind? Or will it, like the Bond franchise itself, continue to thrive even with newcomers in the starring role?</p><p>One of Amazon’s bigger investors reckons it already knows the answer. Baillie Gifford, an Edinburgh-based asset manager, is cutting its stake. To explain why its enthusiasm has waned after 15 years as a shareholder, it borrows Mr Bezos’s mantra that it should always be “Day One” at Amazon—infused with a spirit of long-term focus, customer obsession and bold innovation. “Amazon is now seen as good value, safe and acceptable,” Baillie Gifford recently told its own investors. “It no longer has a founder ceo. We fear that in his inimitable terms it is no longer Day One in Seattle though the road ahead is still long and profitable.”</p><p>There is plenty in Mr Stone’s book to lend weight to such a characterisation. Central to it is Mr Bezos’s omnipotence within the firm. His business acumen is already legendary. Less well known is his role as a master of in-house invention on everything from Alexa, a voice-operated digital assistant, to Amazon’s own-label “single-cow burger”, his obsession with high standards, his tolerance of failure when in service to big ideas, his laser-like focus on financial nitty gritty and his (often exasperating) attention to detail. However much his successor, Andy Jassy, was schooled at his boss’s hip, he may lack the inventive streak that unites the likes of Mr Bezos and Apple’s late founder, Steve Jobs.</p><p>Yet how much mileage was there left in it anyway? Despite a period last year when Mr Bezos took back day-to-day control during the pandemic, his relationship with Amazon has already become semi-detached. Mr Stone portrays a chief executive who, once he had become the world’s richest man, metamorphosed into a master of the universe. From a focus on Amazon’s self-perpetuating “flywheel” of endless choice, relentless innovation and customer-centricity, his horizons expanded: to space, for which he is building rockets; to newspaper publishing, as owner of the Washington Post; and to Hollywood, where he met Lauren Sanchez, for whom he left his wife. He moved into what Mr Stone calls an “alternate dimension of wealth, glamour and international intrigue”. The geek muscled up. He hung out with a-list celebrities. In short, he appeared to have outgrown his terrestrial creation.</p><p>Mr Jassy shares some of Mr Bezos’s virtues, such as what Mr Stone describes as “almost inhuman levels of discipline”. On his watch, Amazon Web Services, the cloud business that is Amazon’s biggest source of profits, has exhibited the parent company’s culture of high standards and unrelenting competitiveness. Since joining the firm in 1997, he has been steeped in Amazon values like frugality. In addition, as Mr Stone writes, Mr Jassy may also be somewhat humbler than Mr Bezos in confronting Amazon’s problems: a marketplace business accused by dissatisfied merchants of fraud and unfair competition (baselessly in Amazon’s eyes), warehouse staff seeking higher pay and better working conditions, and regulatory probes in America and Europe. The company is already splurging on employee health and welfare programmes.</p><p>Mr Jassy’s toughest task may simply be confronting the law of large numbers. With revenues of $386bn last year and a market value of $1.6trn, it is ever harder for Amazon to keep the flywheel going, especially with potential accelerators, such as India, underperforming. Last year the firm had capital expenditures of $40bn. How does it allocate so much money without frittering a lot away?</p><p>The world is not enough<br>Such questions make the potential acquisition of mgm to bolster Amazon’s Prime subscription services intriguing. Even at a pricey $9bn, it is easily affordable for Amazon. Last year it spent $11bn on tv series, films and music for Prime. The reports come days after Mr Jassy announced the return of Jeff Blackburn, a veteran Amazon executive who left the firm recently. He will oversee a media and entertainment business that includes sports rights, such as the National Football League’s “Thursday Night Football”, Twitch, Amazon’s gaming platform, and Amazon Studios, which recently won two Oscars. First he will report to Mr Bezos, then to Mr Jassy.</p><p>This could suggest that the post-Bezos era will be marked by the quest for a new source of rapid growth—a flywheel in which blockbuster entertainment, advertising and shopping reinforce each other. Or it could be the departing ceo’s final vanity project. If it is a flywheel, it may form part of a new era of competition among America’s tech giants. As one observer puts it, Amazon is trying to crack mass entertainment before Facebook and Google crack shopping. If it is a sign of hubris, it would be more worrying, suggesting that Mr Bezos will use his new role as executive chairman to drive Amazon from the leather-clad luxury of the back seat. Perhaps stroking a white cat as he does so. </p>]]></content>

But organisers insist the games will be “safe and secure”</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As the olympic torch passed through Hiroshima this week, organisers kept the relay away from the streets. A torch-lighting ceremony took place without spectators. Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee (ioc), cancelled a planned visit. Hiroshima, along with Tokyo, the host city, and seven other prefectures, is under a state of emergency amid a fourth wave of covid-19.</p><p>The event underlined the contortions required to host a global sporting extravaganza during a pandemic. Japan has so far avoided explosive outbreaks of the virus, with fewer than 12,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, thanks in part to stringent border controls in place since last spring. But more than two-thirds of those fatalities have come this year. The latest wave, fuelled by more infectious variants of the virus, has strained regional health systems, while vaccinations have been slow to flow. The Olympics are scheduled to kick off in two months. About 15,000 athletes and perhaps 90,000 hangers-on from some 200 countries are set to enter Japan. Many Japanese worry that they will be the losers: 60% would rather not hold the games at all.</p><p>Organisers insist the Tokyo Olympics can be held safely. They point to recent virus-free sporting events, such as the Masters, an American golf tournament. They aim to create bubbles around the Olympic village and competition sites, to isolate participants from locals. Though vaccination will not be mandatory for athletes, Mr Bach claims that 80% of those in the Olympic village will be vaccinated by the start of the games. Foreign spectators will not be allowed to attend. A decision on local spectators is expected in June.</p><p>Many doctors and public-health experts remain unconvinced. Resources that could be used for testing, treating or vaccinating the local population may be diverted to the games. Increased movement of people within Japan, such as during public holidays in early May, has tended to beget rises in cases. With events planned in nine prefectures including Tokyo, training camps across the country, and volunteers coming from all over, more movement is inevitable—and with it, more cases, argues Taniguchi Kiyosu, the head of a big hospital in Mie prefecture and a co-author of an editorial in the British Medical Journal calling for the games to be cancelled. Dozens of towns have scrapped their plans to be bases for foreign teams to train.</p><p>New viral variants complicate things even more. The more infectious b.1.1.7 strain already circulates widely. The convergence of people from across the world could allow yet more to enter and mutations to form. “Japan will become a mixing vessel,” says Mr Taniguchi. Participants could bring the virus back to their home countries, many of which have less robust health systems, says Oshitani Hitoshi, a virologist who sits on an expert panel advising the government. “Just one imported case can trigger a large outbreak,” he says.</p><p>Japanese people might feel safer if they had as much protection from the virus as Olympic athletes. According to The Economist’s covid-19 tracker, just 4.5% of Japan’s adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, a shade behind Myanmar. Suga Yoshihide, Japan’s prime minister, wants to finish vaccinating the elderly by the end of July. But only two-thirds of Tokyo’s wards reckon they will be able to. Supply is not the problem. Nikkei, a business daily, recently estimated that at least 10m doses remain unused in freezers.</p><p>Nor, at this stage, is the problem demand. Although Japanese tend to express a high degree of hesitancy about vaccines in general, that reluctance does not appear to extend to the covid-19 vaccine, says Shimoaraiso Makoto of Japan’s covid-19 task force. When reservations for a mass-vaccination centre in Osaka opened this week, the 25,000 slots on offer were booked up in around 25 minutes.</p><p>Instead, logistical tangles and bureaucratic risk-aversion have slowed the roll-out. Booking websites and call centres have suffered technical glitches. The health ministry stuck to rules requiring local clinical trials for foreign vaccines. Only the Pfizer-BioNTech shot has been approved for use so far. Japan also lacks staff to administer vaccines, in part because Japanese law allows only registered doctors or nurses to do so. An exception has been made for dentists; officials are now wringing their hands over whether to let pharmacists give jabs too. A mistake by an inexperienced practitioner could have fatal knock-on effects, given Japan’s history of vaccine hesitancy, argues Mr Oshitani: “We are very, very sensitive to any adverse event in Japan. One single such event may halt the whole vaccination process.”</p><p>Nonetheless, the pace of vaccination is accelerating and likely to quicken more in the coming weeks. Japanese officials were expected to approve the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines as The Economist went to press. The defence ministry plans more mass-vaccination centres. That will please citizens unhappy with the government’s dawdling. More than 80% of Japanese believe the vaccine roll-out is moving too slowly. Approval of Mr Suga’s cabinet has in turn slid to record lows.</p><p>Cancelling the Olympics might help allay many voters’ suspicions that he is giving priority to the games over their health. But it is not as simple as it seems. Olympic host-city contracts give the ioc the exclusive right to call off the games. It remains eager to move forward. If the Japanese government were to cancel unilaterally, the ioc would have the right to seek damages in court, says Matsumoto Taisuke, a sports-law expert at Waseda University in Tokyo. Japanese officials also dread the impression they would create if Japan bailed out, while China, its regional rival, pulls off the Winter Olympics in Beijing early next year. Instead, Mr Suga has taken to repeating a single phrase like a mantra: Japan, he says, will put on a “safe and secure games”. Much, from the fate of his premiership to the course of the pandemic around the world, rides on that promise.</p><p><a id="australia-and-new-zealand-cannot-hide-from-covid-19-for-ever"></a></p><h1 id="Australia-and-New-Zealand-cannot-hide-from-covid-19-for-ever"><a href="#Australia-and-New-Zealand-cannot-hide-from-covid-19-for-ever" class="headerlink" title="Australia and New Zealand cannot hide from covid-19 for ever"></a>Australia and New Zealand cannot hide from covid-19 for ever</h1><p>The countries need a plan for reopening to the world</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Last month Six60, a mystifyingly popular Kiwi band, played a gig for a real, flesh-and-blood audience of 50,000 people. “Next time they tell you it’s impossible,” the band wrote online, “Show them this.” Alongside was a photo of the sort of crowds unseen in most of the world since early 2020.</p><p>Kiwis and Australians can enjoy what used to be known as normal life because they have almost eliminated the novel coronavirus. Neither country has had many local transmissions this year. Restaurants and bars are busy. Provincial towns bustle with domestic tourists.</p><p>The secret to their success is simple: both countries, already hard to reach, simply cut themselves off from the rest of the world. They pulled up the drawbridge in March 2020, allowing only citizens and permanent residents to return. Neither plans to lower it again soon. Australia’s international borders will stay closed until at least mid-2022, its government announced on May 11th. “We have to be careful not to exchange [our] way of life for what everyone else has,” the prime minister, Scott Morrison, told a local newspaper.</p><p>This goes down well with voters on both sides of the Tasman Sea, who have got used to living without risk. Yet covid-19 will circulate globally for years to come, even with vaccines. Antipodeans cannot keep it out forever, “unless they want to be isolated from the world until the end of time”, says Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister.</p><p>Some have started asking what happens next. A group of business leaders in New Zealand has called for “a path towards sustainable virus management”. Australia cannot ride out the pandemic in an “eliminationist bunker”, Nick Coatsworth, Australia’s former deputy chief medical officer, told a room of doctors this month. “There will come a point where we have to change the way we measure our success against covid,” says Gladys Berejiklian, the Liberal (ie, conservative) premier of New South Wales—though not until locals are vaccinated.</p><p>Yet vaccine roll-outs in both countries are proceeding slowly. Only 7.5% of adults in New Zealand have received a first dose, fewer than in Zimbabwe or Palestine, according to The Economist’s tracker. Australia has jabbed 16% of adults once, but many Australians are hesitant about having a shot. The federal government hopes it can immunise all adults by the end of 2021, which would mean working twice as fast.</p><p>There are ways to loosen restrictions before that. One is to impose less onerous quarantines on vaccinated travellers, who must spend two weeks in isolation in a guarded hotel, just like unvaccinated ones. Australia’s government says it is thinking about allowing them to quarantine at home. That could help reunite separated families, of which there are many.</p><p>Another is to start travel corridors with countries with low rates of transmission. Australia is in talks with Singapore, but a fresh outbreak in the city-state has shown how hard these will be to launch. Nervy Kiwis balked even at a bubble with Australia, which started in April, notes Oliver Hartwich of the New Zealand Initiative, a think-tank. That, he says, is about as ambitious as Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, will get for now.</p><p>Neither she nor Mr Morrison has much reason to push hard. Their economies are faring well. And they can easily brush away criticism as callous disregard for life. When the boss of Virgin Australia, an airline, suggested recently that “covid will become part of the community” and “some people may die”, Mr Morrison berated her for being “insensitive”. An election is expected soon. He is well ahead in the polls.</p><p>About 35,000 Australians are still stuck overseas, unable to snag a spot in quarantine hotels or on unpredictable flights. When a new wave of covid-19 washed over India last month, Mr Morrison barred Australians in India from returning or risk fines and jail time. No other country has threatened its own people thus. He later reversed the policy, but three Australian citizens have since died in India. “Going down the hermit route,” says Tim Soutphommasane of the University of Sydney, is “a rejection of our modern transformation into a confident, multicultural country.”</p><p><a id="as-a-second-wave-devastates-india-narendra-modi-vanishes"></a></p><h1 id="As-a-second-wave-devastates-India-Narendra-Modi-vanishes"><a href="#As-a-second-wave-devastates-India-Narendra-Modi-vanishes" class="headerlink" title="As a second wave devastates India, Narendra Modi vanishes"></a>As a second wave devastates India, Narendra Modi vanishes</h1><p>Quick to claim credit, the prime minister is nowhere to be seen when things go wrong</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Over the past seven years Indians have watched Narendra Modi’s neat hair and trim beard grow whiter and longer. There was no way to miss the change, because there was no escaping the prime minister’s face. He was on television snipping ribbons, waving to adoring crowds and grappling foreign leaders; on posters doling out subsidised cooking gas or cheerleading for pilgrimages to Hindu holy sites; and even, in recent months, gazing benignly out of vaccination certificates next to the words “Together, India will defeat covid-19”.</p><p>Yet, as covid casualties rocketed up in mid-April, the omnipresent Mr Modi started fading like the Cheshire Cat. For weeks he scarcely appeared at all, and now that his handlers are producing more of what they call “interactions”, these tend to take the form of stilted Zoom calls with panels of officials, or, more recently, a helicopter tour over his own storm-battered state of Gujarat.</p><p>With thousands of Indians dying daily, and many more failing to find life-giving oxygen or simply a dignified funeral for their loved ones, one might have expected a man with such a showman’s talent to rise to the occasion, to signal solace or hope to a wounded nation. But the most powerful leader in a generation seems unable to do more than deliver finger-wagging homilies. “When we needed a warrior we see instead a Himalayan sage,” muses Karan Thapar, one of India’s most seasoned television interviewers.</p><p>The prime minister’s absence should come as no surprise. In other moments of turmoil he has similarly chosen to step back rather than forward. When anti-Muslim pogroms roiled the state of Gujarat in 2002, soon after he had become its chief minister, Mr Modi vanished into “top-level” conclaves. As prime minister, Mr Modi was absent for months as lynch mobs rampaged in the name of “cow protection”. When nationwide protests against new citizenship laws broke out in 2019, when sectarian riots exploded in Delhi a few months later and when more massive protests erupted again last autumn over new farm laws, the prime minister was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>In fact, the tendency to shy away from bad news has become a trademark not just of Mr Modi, but of his government. The prime minister himself has never held a press conference, and typically reserves interviews for servile reporters. His lesser ministers, too, have over time grown less accessible and less amenable to questioning, even in parliament: covid has provided an excuse to shorten sessions and cancel committee meetings.</p><p>When a stage empties, other actors step in. Cartoonists, an increasingly harried profession under Mr Modi, are now on the offensive, picturing the prime minister hiding in his closet with his multicoloured “Modi jackets”, or playing a fiddle surrounded by funeral pyres. Many have attacked his government’s tone-deaf insistence on pursuing a $2.6bn vanity remake of the government complex in central Delhi in the midst of a pandemic. “And here is the secret bunker where you can hide from any national crisis,” says an architect in one cartoon, pointing at what others have derided as the “coffin-shaped” design of India’s planned new parliament building. Another cartoon inserts long white beards into a snakes-and-ladders board where the goal is to get vaccinated. Land on a wrong square and you slide back down the beard.</p><p>Nor is it just professional funsters who are weighing in. On May 12th one of India’s biggest student unions filed a missing-person report for Amit Shah, the home minister, on the grounds that Mr Modi’s closest henchman, who is also the most feared person in India, has not been sighted for weeks. Around the same time, posters appeared in Delhi questioning the government’s decision to send millions of vaccine doses abroad before securing them for “our children”.</p><p>But perhaps the hardest blow to Mr Modi’s image may be one from a less expected quarter. Writing in the prime minister’s native tongue, Gujarati, Parul Khakkar, a housewife-turned-poet whose verse is much admired in the prime minister’s own Hindu-nationalist circles, penned a short, bleak poem addressing a king. Your promised “Ram rajya” or heavenly kingdom, she concludes every stanza, has made of the sacred Ganges a corpse-carrying hearse. And the king, his people now see, is naked. After receiving more than 25,000 abusive messages, Ms Khakkar had to turn her Facebook page private. But her bitter diatribe has gone, for want of a better word, viral.</p><p><a id="china---chinese-parents-are-keen-on-a-more-confucian-education"></a></p><h1 id="China-—Chinese-parents-are-keen-on-a-more-Confucian-education"><a href="#China-—Chinese-parents-are-keen-on-a-more-Confucian-education" class="headerlink" title="(China)—Chinese parents are keen on a more Confucian education"></a>(China)—Chinese parents are keen on a more Confucian education</h1><p>So is the government, hoping it will boost patriotism and fill a moral vacuum</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>At first glance, Huaguoshan kindergarten in Zhuzhou, a city in the southern province of Hunan, looks much like any other nursery. Four brightly painted playrooms have buckets of building bricks and soft, coloured mats. But on higher floors, the classrooms are more spartan. Rice-paper lanterns and a row of black roof tiles running along the top of the walls evoke ancient Chinese architecture. Children wear powder-blue fleeces with the mandarin collars and frog fasteners of traditional jackets. Large portraits of Confucius hang on otherwise bare walls.</p><p>The kindergarten opened in September but already has a year-long waiting list. It taps into a growing nationwide demand for guoxue, or “national studies”. This usually involves learning classical Chinese thought, texts and morals, especially those associated with Confucius. Children at Huaguoshan are taught how to bow, how to greet each other politely in the street and how to sit attentively, with back straight and hands placed carefully in their laps. In one room they noisily stamp leaves onto muslin bags to learn an ancient dyeing technique. In others they recite poems, practise calligraphy, perform tea ceremonies and play Chinese chess. But, say teachers, mastering skills is secondary to building character. A child learns to “respect her rival and accept defeat” in chess; in the tea room, to “value what is fragile as you would a porcelain cup”.</p><p>After decades of worshipping foreign trends, many people are now interested in such traditions. Television shows include “Chinese Poetry Conference”, in which members of the public are quizzed on classical stanzas. Young people don traditional robes in public. At the heart of the trend is education. Frost &amp; Sullivan, a data firm, estimated that the market for children’s guoxue education was worth 466bn yuan ($73bn) in 2018, almost double its value in 2014. Schools charge hefty fees. The organisation that runs Huaguoshan, a non-profit, also relies on donations. It promotes its educational philosophy on social media, with clips of its pre-schoolers reciting poems in traditional garb.</p><p>Revered for 2,500 years, Confucius was vilified during the 20th century. Guoxue fans speak of “a hundred-year gap”. In 1905 the failing Qing dynasty abolished imperial civil-service examinations based on the sishu, the four Confucian texts. Modernisers saw the beliefs as blocking progress.</p><p>The worst assaults were after the Communists came to power in 1949. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao exhorted people to smash anything old. Gangs of Red Guards swarmed Qufu, the sage’s hometown, and blew up his tomb. It was only in the mid-1980s, nearly a decade after Mao’s death, that the anniversary of Confucius’s birth could be marked once again.</p><p>Top down, bottom up<br>China’s return to tradition is driven in part by a sense of cultural loss. Many Chinese people are eager to rediscover their heritage, stripped away by decades of Communist rule. But it is also flourishing because it now meshes with official objectives. President Xi Jinping has done more than any other modern leader to elevate Confucian ideas. Soon after coming to power in 2013, Mr Xi visited Qufu, as emperors had done before him. He called for “new and positive roles” for Confucianism.</p><p>The ancient system of thought emphasises respect for authority, reverence for ancestors and deference to elders. Confucius taught that such values were essential to achieve moral excellence as an individual. Such upstanding citizens would form the basis for wider social harmony and political stability. Emperors used the philosophy to instil obedience. Mr Xi wants to do the same. Party leaders also approve of Confucianism because, unlike socialism, it is home-grown. It appeals to young nationalists who cheer the party’s call for wenhua zixin, or cultural self-confidence.</p><p>Strictly speaking, all primary and secondary students should be at state-regulated schools, though most kindergartens are private. Guoxue content, such as classical poems, has long been part of the state secondary-school curriculum. In 2014 more of it was added to the university-entrance exam. The number of classical texts to be taught in schools increased from 14 to 72. In 2017 the government put out guidelines for having a comprehensive guoxue syllabus in primary and secondary schools by 2025. In May the education ministry confirmed the plans, saying it was important for young people “to be formed into upright Chinese” with the patriotism “to serve the country”. State-approved guoxue classes would “enhance a sense of belonging to and pride in the Chinese nation”.</p><p>For many Chinese, the sage’s musings hold a different appeal. In neglected Confucian morals, educators see a set of values that may be a solution to modern social ills, just as some in the West turn to traditional Christian values. Jia Hong, who set up Huaguoshan and two other guoxue pre-schools, says, “Nowadays we hear about so much bullying and brattish behaviour.” Many think a lack of good manners is to blame. Three-quarters of the 200 children at Ms Jia’s kindergartens used to attend regular ones. She says parents remark on how Confucian rituals have calmed their children and helped them focus.</p><p>Many young parents believe that the national obsession with exams has distracted them from other forms of edification, says Cao Shenggao of Shaanxi Normal University. Some do consider the discipline instilled by guoxue, or mastery of the zither, say, as one more way to set their child apart in the educational rat race. Guoxue institutes often hint that their after-school classes can help boost test scores.</p><p>But many others see guoxue kindergartens, which are legal, and guoxue primary and secondary schools, which operate in a legal grey area, as a way to shield children from relentless competition, at least early on. Scandals have spurred the government to crack down on the shadier end of such schooling. In 2019 a boy died after teachers at his boarding school refused to take him to a hospital, insisting on using traditional medicine. Last year the founder of a guoxue camp that claimed to cure internet addiction was sentenced to three years in prison, after pupils were found to have been abused. The government has also banned the teaching of “feudal dregs”, such as Confucian texts extolling female submission.</p><p>Educators such as Ms Jia support the crackdown. But many popular guoxue schools for older children are keen to stay self-sufficient if they can, declining offers to work with local education boards. Tian Yu, a scholar of Chinese education based in America, finds that the schools appeal to certain parents as a way to avoid the political indoctrination of the state system. Guoxue educators say quietly that the revival of forgotten culture should come from the bottom up. But in a contest to define what counts as tradition, the party will always want to have a say. </p><p><a id="how-disgruntled-chinese-people-talk-about-you-know-who"></a></p><h1 id="How-disgruntled-Chinese-people-talk-about-you-know-who"><a href="#How-disgruntled-Chinese-people-talk-about-you-know-who" class="headerlink" title="How disgruntled Chinese people talk about you-know-who"></a>How disgruntled Chinese people talk about you-know-who</h1><p>Are they quoting ancient poems or complaining about a modern emperor?</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On may 6th Wang Xing, a Chinese tech tycoon, posted a classical ninth-century poem on Fanfou, a social-media platform. The poem mocked an ancient Chinese emperor who tried to quell unrest by burning books. “The ashes of burnt books had not yet faded away but the Qin dynasty was already weak,” read the poem. For some reason, cynics suggested that the dynasty Mr Wang had in mind was not an ancient one at all, and the “emperor” he was mocking was Xi Jinping.</p><p>Mr Wang swiftly deleted the post, and censors wiped all comments. But the share price of Mr Wang’s firm, Meituan, a popular online platform for shopping and delivery services, promptly collapsed. In four days it declined in value by $26bn, wiping $2.5bn from Mr Wang’s personal fortune. He insisted that he had been referring to competition within the e-commerce industry. His firm is one of several that have come under recent close scrutiny from antitrust regulators.</p><p>Open criticism of the most important man in China is taboo. Last year Ren Zhiqiang, a retired property tycoon and vocal critic of the government, published an essay about a speech by Mr Xi in which Mr Ren said he was not an “emperor” showing off his new clothes but a naked “clown”. Shortly afterwards, Mr Ren was sentenced to 18 years in prison for corruption.</p><p>Even knocking lesser officials is risky. Jack Ma, the boss of Alibaba, another conglomerate, complained about China’s financial regulators last year. Authorities stopped the initial public offering of Ant Group, a fintech firm founded by Mr Ma, which would have been the largest ever.</p><p>Others have been more careful. In April Wen Jiabao, China’s prime minister from 2003 to 2013, published a remembrance of his mother in a Macau newspaper. It included lines calling for a China “filled with fairness and justice” and “respect for human hearts”. Some thought he might be suggesting that fairness and justice were currently lacking. Censors pounced.</p><p>Such is the current climate that even those who broadly support the government are sometimes nervous about mentioning Mr Xi’s name. Some employees at a state-run media group have taken to substituting the word “Trump” for Mr Xi in chat groups. At small social gatherings, people frequently stop short of uttering the name, even in the most benign contexts. They use instead phrases such as “you-know-who”, “big number one”, “the eldest brother” or “our big uncle”.</p><p>When, at a recent private gathering that included diplomats, executives and bankers, the talk turned to Chinese politics, it was suggested that all switch off their mobile phones. No one thought it likely that government snoops were really listening in and no one had anything particularly controversial to say. But all agreed it was better to be safe.</p><p>Electronic eavesdropping is not the only concern. The old-fashioned sort is also encouraged. Last month, the government launched a new system, with a website and hotline, for citizens to snitch on one another for making “harmful” political commentary. This can include “denying the excellent traditional Chinese culture, revolution culture and advanced socialist culture” as well as attacks on political leaders or their policies.</p><p>In 2014 the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors to Britain each fancifully declared the other’s country the “Voldemort” of Asia (after the Harry Potter baddy). Back then, an all-powerful leader known as “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” was the stuff of fiction. Nowadays…shush! </p><p><a id="why-wealthy-chinese-families-recruit-poor-graduates-as-sons-in-law"></a></p><h1 id="Why-wealthy-Chinese-families-recruit-poor-graduates-as-sons-in-law"><a href="#Why-wealthy-Chinese-families-recruit-poor-graduates-as-sons-in-law" class="headerlink" title="Why wealthy Chinese families recruit poor graduates as sons-in-law"></a>Why wealthy Chinese families recruit poor graduates as sons-in-law</h1><p>The practice draws on an ancient tradition</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The lingyin temple in Hangzhou, a lovely, tree-shaded place, has long drawn those seeking the blessings of a good marriage or children. Pilgrims may still be glimpsed today. On a recent afternoon Chaguan watched a mother and daughter leave a tour group to pray, incense sticks held aloft, to a statue of Guanyin, a Buddhist immortal, before hurrying back to their guide.</p><p>In centuries past, praying was all that many Chinese, especially women, could do, for they were powerless about much in their lives. Marriage was a transaction between families, not a love match. It led, almost invariably, to a woman moving into her husband’s home. There, her role was to give birth to heirs, meaning sons, and to care for his parents in their dotage. A woman could not own property and, once bridal payments and dowries had been exchanged, brought so few benefits to her birth family that married daughters were likened to “sprinkled water”. In cruel consequence, girls were often killed at birth.</p><p>A few marriages were different. Since the Qin dynasty in the third century, a family without adult sons might recruit a poor but healthy man to “lend his strength” to their household as a live-in son-in-law. Some signed contracts agreeing to give their children their wife’s surname and to look after their parents-in-law before their own father and mother. Shocked by such breaches of filial piety, officials in the Yuan and Ming dynasties (between the 13th and the 17th centuries) banned men who were only sons from entering into such unions. Men who did faced widespread scorn. They were called zhuixu, or “mortgaged sons-in-law”, or, more politely, shangmen nuxu—“gate-entering sons-in-law”.</p><p>Modern China is becoming more open-minded about what constitutes a good family, and with good reason. A national census unveiled on May 11th showed that China is ageing fast and has one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, so its population will soon be shrinking. Though the one-child policy became a two-child policy for most urban residents in 2016 and is set to loosen further, its malign effects will endure. Lone children must care for elderly parents without any help from siblings, which is one reason why many of them do not want offspring of their own. Because China is missing millions of women, lots of young men will never marry. Years of illegal, sex-selective abortions skewed China’s birth ratio. The census finds that 111 boys are born for every 100 girls.</p><p>With fewer women, an optimist might imagine they would gain more power over whom they marry. There are other reasons why chauvinist traditions may fade. China is an increasingly urban, mobile country. Some 376m people live in a different city or town from the place named on their hukou, the household registration papers that limit where Chinese may live, work and obtain public health care or schooling. China is better educated, with over 200m university graduates. What is more, women students have outnumbered men on college campuses since 2009. In another change, families that own homes in larger cities have become wealthy after a decades-long property boom, especially if they bought apartments 20 or more years ago. Lots of those newly rich families have one child, a daughter, and—quite properly—are ambitious for her. The Beijing College Students Panel Survey, a big study, found that women students are more likely than men to come from affluent big-city families (and to study liberal arts). Male students are more likely to hail from poorer, provincial families and to study sciences or engineering, reflecting family hopes that they will land well-paid technical jobs.</p><p>Predictably, it is not hard to find educated, urban women demanding more say over their lives. At the Hangzhou temple, Chaguan meets a fresh-faced couple emerging from the Guanyin shrine, and asks what they wished for. “I prayed we’ll endure the test of time, I don’t know about him,” replies Chen Jiajia, shyly scrutinising her boyfriend, Chen Jingsheng. Now 25, they met at high school in the southern province of Guangdong and have been together for seven years. Most women expect a man to own an apartment before marrying, Mr Chen said. That is a big pressure in a city as expensive as Guangzhou, where he works in information technology. A native of a small city, Meizhou, he lacks a Guangzhou hukou, another obstacle to buying property. Ms Chen has Guangzhou papers, and her family helped the couple to buy a flat. “They see potential in him, they think he is driven. If he weren’t, our parents would not support us in this way,” explains Ms Chen, who works in e-commerce.</p><p>Less predictably, such social trends are bringing new attention to an old tradition, that of zhuixu. Li Jiyan, a matchmaker from Xiaoshan, a district of Hangzhou, specialises in finding graduates from poorer provinces to marry property-owning women from his city. His file-choked office is lined with framed photographs of him being interviewed by Chinese television stations and newspapers about the 1,000 marriages he has brokered since 1999. Men on his books must be graduates of vocational college or university, earn 100,000 yuan ($15,540) a year and be taller than 1.70m. Crucially, they do not need to own property in Hangzhou.</p><p>Never mind love, let’s talk apartments<br>Mr Li is busy, fielding telephone calls from potential clients and turning away a young man who walks in but lacks a college degree. “Don’t give up,” he calls after the crestfallen youth. By taking in a poor outsider, families gain a biddable son-in-law and children bearing their mother’s name, he enthuses. He adds approvingly that “non-local boys” will take humble jobs, like riding delivery scooters, if graduate work dries up. Though he praises self-made men, Mr Li’s business model is really founded on inequality, a scourge of ancient and modern China alike. In a moment of candour, his wife once remarked that no home-owner would become a gate-entering son-in-law. The couple charge 15,000 yuan for two years’ matchmaking. If that fails, there is always prayer.</p><p><a id="middle-east--africa---eritrea%E2%80%99s-president-issaias-afwerki-bids-for-regional-greatness"></a></p><h1 id="Middle-East-amp-Africa-—Eritrea’s-President-Issaias-Afwerki-bids-for-regional-greatness"><a href="#Middle-East-amp-Africa-—Eritrea’s-President-Issaias-Afwerki-bids-for-regional-greatness" class="headerlink" title="(Middle East &amp; Africa)—Eritrea’s President Issaias Afwerki bids for regional greatness"></a>(Middle East &amp; Africa)—Eritrea’s President Issaias Afwerki bids for regional greatness</h1><p>But his latest gamble is risky</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Shy and awkward, the teenage Issaias Afwerki did not stand out. As a student in Asmara, Eritrea’s capital, the future president was known less for his bookish brilliance than for sudden flashes of temper. One day in the early 1960s his physics teacher, an American, handed him a particularly shoddy mark. Issaias walked calmly to the front of the class and slapped him in the face. An act of vindictiveness as well as self-confidence, it was characteristic of the man for the rest of his life.</p><p>It is 30 years this month since Issaias, as leader of the secessionist Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, at last succeeded in overthrowing Ethiopia’s military dictatorship. In alliance with the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (tplf), a rebel movement to Eritrea’s south, Issaias, now 75, assumed power in Asmara, while his tplf friends took up the reins in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. Two years later Eritreans voted in a referendum to break away from Ethiopia. Issaias became the nation’s first and only president. There has never been an election.</p><p>Few African leaders have ruled their countrymen so harshly or handled their neighbours so aggressively. In 1998 Eritrea went to war with Ethiopia over a barren stretch of land worth almost nothing (pictured). In two bloody years perhaps 70,000 lives were lost. The remains of Eritrea’s fledgling democracy was crushed. A decade later Issaias invaded Djibouti, which abuts Eritrea at the mouth of the Red Sea.</p><p>Now Eritrean forces, made up of conscripts, are fighting again. This time they are in Tigray as allies of Ethiopia’s government in a catastrophic war against Issaias’s former allies, the tplf. The Eritreans have been accused of war crimes, including massacres of civilians and mass rape.</p><p>The secretiveness of Issaias’s regime spawns endless speculation about his intentions. Some say the president’s main aim is to outmanoeuvre Ethiopia and remake the Horn of Africa in his own anti-democratic image. Though this is sometimes overstated, he is thought to wield great influence over Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, with whom he signed an opaque peace agreement in 2018 that put an end to nearly two decades of cold war between the two countries. He has also drawn close to Somalia’s authoritarian president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, better known as Farmaajo, and has hosted and trained thousands of Somali troops.</p><p>Issaias’s foreign policy has three main planks. The first is his belief that the Horn of Africa is a bear pit where there are no permanent friends. Second, the use of force is always legitimate. Third, even a tiny and impoverished country like Eritrea can, with ruthlessness and guile, punch well above its weight. Ask North Korea.</p><p>The breakdown of Issaias’s relations with his old comrades in the tplf testifies to his belief that no ally can be trusted. Eritrea’s defeat in the border war with Ethiopia (then ruled by the tplf) in 1998-2000 sorely embittered him. Awet Tewelde Weldemichael, an Eritrean at Queen’s University in Canada, likens Issaias to “a camel which can never sleep without settling a score”. When Abiy, an ethnic Oromo from Ethiopia’s south, took office in 2018 and sidelined the Tigrayan old guard, Issaias saw his chance. Six months ago his troops joined the fray as allies of Abiy, almost as soon as fighting broke out between Ethiopia’s federal government and the tplf.</p><p>The destruction wrought by the Eritreans in Tigray reflects more than a desire for vengeance. It also stems from Issaias’s long-standing conviction that the tplf threatens his country’s very existence. Butchering young Tigrayan men, as well as looting infrastructure, food and medical supplies, should—reckons Issaias—scotch any chance of this happening. By the same token, the destruction of two camps in Tigray hosting Eritrean refugees and dissidents was intended to prevent the tplf from training and arming a potential opposition to Issaias’s regime.</p><p>Issaias’s ambitions, however, reach well beyond Tigray. “Eliminating the tplf is about eliminating an obstacle on his path to Addis Ababa and the region,” says Seeye Abraha, a former defence minister of Ethiopia who was once high in the tplf. Recently in Foreign Policy, an American journal, he argued that what Issaias really covets is access to Ethiopia’s wealth.</p><p>In his bid to master the Horn of Africa, he has sought to influence Abiy, who runs a much larger and more important country. Last year, with the backing of the Ethiopian and Somali pair of leaders, he set up a new regional bloc, which he hopes will replace the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, hitherto the region’s premier club, which also includes Djibouti (seat of its secretariat), Kenya, the two Sudans and Uganda. The trio of leaders is wooing South Sudan to join the new club. This particularly annoys Djibouti.</p><p>Even more controversial are rumours of plans to bind Ethiopia and Eritrea into some kind of union. Their armies are co-operating along Ethiopia’s shaky border with Sudan, as well as in Tigray. In March a spokesman for Ethiopia’s foreign ministry suggested that Eritrean independence had been a mistake that political integration could one day rectify. He apologised in the face of a backlash. But Issaias spoke enthusiastically about a confederation with Ethiopia after the independence referendum of 1993. Might he again contemplate such an arrangement, provided Eritrea won more clout alongside its beefier partner? “Issaias will never allow any federation with Ethiopia which does not allow him to dominate it,” says a former colleague, now in exile.</p><p>Right now, Issaias has more pressing concerns. His troops are bogged down in Tigray, though both he and Abiy agreed in March to remove them. “We see nothing that would lead us to believe there are preparations on the ground for such a withdrawal,” says a senior state department official. The American administration is threatening sanctions against Ethiopia and Eritrea. The eu has already withdrawn more than $100m in aid for Eritrea.</p><p>Issaias’s survival depends on winning his latest war. “He’s bet the house on [it],” says Dan Connell, the author of a book on Eritrea’s liberation war. “He’s thrown everything at it…He has to fight on.” </p><p><a id="why-vessels-passing-near-iran-may-have-trouble-staying-on-course"></a></p><h1 id="Why-vessels-passing-near-Iran-may-have-trouble-staying-on-course"><a href="#Why-vessels-passing-near-Iran-may-have-trouble-staying-on-course" class="headerlink" title="Why vessels passing near Iran may have trouble staying on course"></a>Why vessels passing near Iran may have trouble staying on course</h1><p>Shipowners suspect their satnav systems are being “spoofed”</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The strait of hormuz is hard to navigate at the best of times. It is narrow, crooked, dotted with islands and, as the only way in or out of the Persian Gulf, busy. Recently, a new peril has joined the list: that satellite-navigation systems may be “spoofed” to lure vessels off course.</p><p>The world has four global-navigation satellite systems (gnss), of which gps is the best known. Global shipping—and much else—is almost completely reliant on them. But in 2008 an American academic named Todd Humphreys revealed that satnav systems could be fooled by sending counterfeit signals. Five years later he proved it by sending a big yacht miles out of its way, to the consternation of the fbi. An Iranian general once boasted of his forces’ prowess in this technique, which appears to have been used in 2011 to inveigle an American drone from Afghan airspace into Iran, where it was captured and put on display.</p><p>Crews of vessels passing through the Strait of Hormuz suspect that Iran is now performing much the same trick on them, to induce them to stray into Iran’s territorial waters, whereupon they are seized by the Iranian navy. That may be what happened in 2016, when two small American naval patrol boats and ten sailors were captured near a tiny Iranian island in the Gulf. If so, it was quite a coup: naval vessels tend to have equipment and procedures intended to prevent spoofing. Typically, it is commercial vessels that are most at risk.</p><p>There is some debate as to whether the Stena Impero, a tanker seized by Iran in the strait in 2019 (pictured overleaf), was a victim of spoofing. The Swedish firm that owns it, Stena Bulk, says it was captured outside Iranian waters. No evidence of spoofing has been found. But the firm’s ceo, Erik Hanell, concedes that if spoofing is stealthy, proving it is hard. Stena Bulk, he says, had been warned by spy agencies that spoofing was a risk. Dozens of ships in the strait had detected satnav anomalies in the days before the seizure, reports c4ads, an American investigative outfit.</p><p>Whatever happened, shipowners appear to be worried about spoofing. Some instruct crew to check up on their satnavs using the old-fashioned navigation methods that preceded gps—although not many crew members know how to do this these days. Others are investing in systems to foil spoofing. Shift5, an American firm that sells such kit, says its sales are on track to quadruple this year.</p><p>For Iran, spoofing is a cheap way of riling Western powers and giving itself leverage in international affairs. It sees the scam as “a way to mark its territory, show its determination”, says Gérard Valin, a former commander of France’s forces in the Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. But sabotaging the technology that underpins commercial shipping also has some very practical applications. Windward, an Israeli firm that tracks vessels, mostly from space, has recently detected a scam involving the transponders that allow owners (and others) to keep track of where their ships are. A tanker sails, its transponder off, from Iran to the Gulf of Oman. There, it meets a vessel that came from elsewhere, its transponder on. The second vessel then turns its transponder off just as the first starts to send out signals mimicking the second’s transponder, in what Dror Salzman of Windward calls a “handshake”. After the impostor drops off its oil, it returns, relinquishing the transponder signal to its waiting double, and disappears. For a country struggling to export its supply of oil owing to strict American sanctions, such a ruse would be invaluable.</p>]]></content>

In 1996, then-Senator Joe Biden was gushing about the vote he would soon cast in support of sharp reductions in cash payments for single mothers. “The culture of welfare must be replaced with the culture of work,” he said on the floor of the Senate. “The culture of dependence must be replaced with the culture of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.”</p><p>These days, President Joe Biden is proposing an ambitious reweaving of the American safety-net, which the White House estimates will cost $1.8trn. The American Families Plan contains components of a European welfare state that have long been missing in the country: a child allowance, paid family leave, universal pre-school, subsidised child care and free community college. It contains no reference to work requirements. Now that Mr Biden is president, his analysis of the problem has changed. “There’s millions of women out of work today not because they’re not qualified for the jobs they have, but they can’t take care of their children and do their job,” he has said.</p><p>The president’s opinions have followed those of his party: where the party goes, the man follows. So how did Democrats go from Clintonism—which implicitly conceded the Reaganite idea that too much government assistance is a very bad thing—to its present-day relish for deficit-financed expansions of the safety-net? Many factors are at work. They include general worries about inequality; a changed academic consensus among economists; a leftward shift reflected in the Democratic presidential primaries; the Republican Party’s abandonment of fiscal responsibility under Donald Trump; and the recent spending bonanza prompted by covid-19.</p><p>Data for Progress, a polling outfit, finds that the vast majority of Democratic voters endorse deficit spending on universal pre-school, clean-energy research, a health-insurance public option and a child allowance. More surprising is their finding that majorities of Republican voters support the same suite of policies (except for health insurance, on which they are exactly split).</p><p>However it happened, the break in philosophy, epitomised in the president’s own transformation, is here. According to this approach, reducing poverty is no longer just about aid targeted at the poor, which remains only tepidly popular. Poverty reduction is a side-benefit of programmes that aim to help middle-class Americans as well. This would bring America more in line with the rest of the developed world. Average government spending on benefits such as child allowances, family leave and early education is 2.1% of gdp in the oecd club of mostly rich countries. In America, it is just 0.6%. The recommendations of the Biden plan could do a lot of good for American families, particularly if its excesses were curtailed.</p><p>Start with the most important bits. At present, one in six American children live in poverty by the government’s own measure. International comparisons, using a measure called relative poverty, suggest that the American rate is among the highest in the rich world. It is caused by flimsy support for the youngest (the elderly, meanwhile, receive Social Security and Medicare). A generous child allowance is the main anti-poverty tool in most rich countries—and one America lacks. One such scheme was created this year as part of the covid-19 relief bill that the president signed in March. It will pay most families $3,000 per year per child ($3,600 for young children) and is expected to halve the poverty rate soon after its payments begin in July. A simultaneous boost to the earned-income tax credit, which tops up the wages of low-paid workers, would also reduce poverty among childless adults (while reducing disincentives to work).</p><p>Under the terms of the law, the child-allowance payments will last for only one year. The president’s plan proposes to extend these payments until 2025. Some Democrats think they should simply be made permanent rather than risking difficult concessions in a future when Republicans hold one chamber of Congress or the White House. “That’s the real downside risk: the possibility that we could end up having to agree to a bunch of regressive tax policies in order to extend what is a very progressive and popular tax policy,” says Michael Bennet, a Democratic senator from Colorado who has championed proposals of this sort since 2017. If the payments lapsed, child-poverty rates would probably shoot up again.</p><p>The administration’s decision to set an expiry date for the most important portion of its families package illustrates a quirk of Bidenism. The president wants to pursue a progressive wish-list while also nodding towards fiscal moderation. His team is already stretching the maths to suggest that its plans in this area could all be paid for by taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Recent number-crunching by the Penn Wharton Budget Model thinks the administration would still be several hundred billion dollars short. Making the child-allowance permanent would have been even harder to match with tax increases, particularly if they applied only to the rich.</p><p>The families plan resembles policy platforms of Mr Biden’s Democratic challengers, cobbled together and funded at a fraction of their originally proposed cost. Among this set of rival ideas are Mr Bennet’s child-benefits plan, Kirsten Gillibrand’s paid family-leave proposal and Elizabeth Warren’s massive subsidies for child-care centres. Republicans claim that all this is evidence of a Trojan-horse presidency of creeping socialism. But it is worth noting that Mr Biden’s proposed spending, grand as it seems, is approximately one-tenth of that laid out by Ms Warren in her primary campaign.</p><p>A half-strength cocktail can still induce a buzz. “In pretty much every respect, it really is just catching us up to what our peer countries have done for quite some time. On paid family leave, that dates back to Bismarck in Germany,” says Jane Waldfogel, an influential scholar on child wellbeing at Columbia University. Only America and Papua New Guinea lack a paid maternity-leave programme, notes Ms Waldfogel. Mr Biden aims to rectify that by setting up a federal scheme that would guarantee 12 weeks of leave. The federal compensation for time taken off would cost $225bn over the coming decade.</p><p>States that have implemented paid family leave on their own initiative, like California, suggest that what works in the rest of the developed world would take well in America, too. Infant health, maternal health and rates of breastfeeding all increase with the implementation of such a programme, says Maya Rossin-Slater, an economist at Stanford University. Ms Rossin-Slater’s own studies of the Californian example have shown a positive effect on new mothers taking up jobs, though other studies have found a reduction in employment. “I like to say that paid family leave is not a silver bullet for solving gender-equity issues,” Ms Rossin-Slater points out.</p><p>A kinder kindergarten<br>A similar amount, about $200bn, is proposed to create universal pre-school for children aged three and four. This was a policy goal of Democrats even before Barack Obama pitched it, unsuccessfully, in his second term (at a more modest cost of $75bn). Advocates often cite the impressive long-run results from two experiments conducted 50 years ago, the Perry Preschool Project and the Abecedarian Early Intervention Project, which brought remarkable improvements to education levels, employment and family lives. The question, however, is whether high-quality pre-school can be scaled up. States such as Oklahoma, which implemented universal pre-school programmes decades ago, provide more up-to-date evidence. These, too, register positive effects on middle-school performance years later. Poorer pupils benefit the most from these programmes, scholars agree, but the results depend on the quality of the schooling.</p><p>Other components are shakier. Take the generous subsidies proposed for child-care centres, under which families in rich states could receive tens of thousands of dollars in federal payments. According to the proposal, the cost of care at such centres would be capped at 7% of household income, for families making as much as 150% of the median household income in a given state. The paradox of child care in America is that it is ruinously expensive, almost $15,000 for an infant looked after in a centre, while child-care workers make $12.24 per hour. Mr Biden thinks that this market failure can be rectified by an enormous infusion of cash. But it seems more likely that, if the federal government is paying for much of it, such child care would become even more expensive.</p><p>Discussion of efficient spending may now be seen as gauche in Democratic circles, but the question of quality matters as well. Done poorly, child care can have long-run negative effects rather than positive ones. The province of Quebec implemented a heavily subsidised universal child-care programme. A review of the results by three economists found that children had worse behaviour and social skills as a result; their parents, though they worked more, were less caring and reported worse health. Reviewing the evidence 11 years later, the same trio found that the negative effects had persisted and that “cohorts with increased child-care access had worse health, lower life satisfaction, and higher crime rates later in life”.</p><p>This ought not to be fatal to the aspiration of universal child care in America. A brief experiment with the idea during the second world war seemed to benefit children later, for instance. But it is a cautionary tale about the quality of public services that Democrats seem reluctant to grapple with. For all the expense of formal child care in America, only one in ten providers are considered high quality.</p><p>A similar problem may confront Mr Biden’s proposal to make community college free for two years. Generous subsidies and loan provision with little attention to quality resulted in the growth of shoddy for-profit colleges (remember Trump University?). The Obama administration spent years drafting regulations to rectify that problem. With a newly advertised $109bn pot of money, ensuring that students actually enroll in degree programmes that provide gainful employment will be all the more important. Mr Biden’s approach is at least admirably restrained in comparison with the ideas coming from the party’s left wing, which endorses a highly regressive programme of universal student-debt cancellation and heavy subsidies for four-year colleges favoured by the rich.</p><p>If Mr Biden does manage to create a durable new welfare policy, one characterised more by its benefits for the middle class than by aggressive means-testing, he could create a better safety-net. Beyond the political challenge of actually getting it passed in Congress, however, lies the need to prove that the new approach is economically sound. If employment drops, opponents will fret, as Paul Ryan, a former Republican speaker of the House, once did, that the net has become “a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into complacency and dependency.” Already, Republicans are arguing that too-generous unemployment benefits are stalling the recovery. If inflation spikes, Mr Biden will be attacked for spending too much and overheating the economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, progressives in his party will forever think he did not go far enough. Nonetheless, they may also step back and consider their luck. After half a century in Washington, the final role Mr Biden wants to play is as the author of the biggest experiment in social policy since the 1960s.</p><p><a id="having-taken-criticism-for-being-overcautious-the-cdc-tries-the-opposite"></a></p><h1 id="Having-taken-criticism-for-being-overcautious-the-CDC-tries-the-opposite"><a href="#Having-taken-criticism-for-being-overcautious-the-CDC-tries-the-opposite" class="headerlink" title="Having taken criticism for being overcautious, the CDC tries the opposite"></a>Having taken criticism for being overcautious, the CDC tries the opposite</h1><p>Meanwhile, America’s vaccination rate is plateauing at a low level</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Perhaps the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc) intended to create an incentive for people to get jabbed when it rolled back mask requirements for vaccinated Americans. The announcement was welcomed by those eager to return to normalcy. But with daily vaccination rates slowing, despite ample supply of vaccine, does the guidance risk making herd immunity a more distant prospect?</p><p>Inoculated Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors or to physically distance except on public transport and when required to do so by federal, state, local or private regulations. Before the announcement, public-health officials had been critical of the cdc’s extreme caution. Just two weeks before, the cdc made an announcement that only vaccinated Americans could go outdoors without masks. Many saw this as unnecessarily timid: studies suggest the unvaccinated would probably be safe while outside and unmasked. Evidence for outdoor transmission is slim. And outdoor dining had been available in most places throughout the pandemic, which requires unmasking regardless of vaccination status.</p><p>The latest announcement therefore came as a surprise. The cdc’s job is to provide scientific recommendations, but in this case it made a decision that influenced policy without warning, catching city mayors, state health officials and business owners unawares. “The White House covid team should have been directing this, not the cdc,” argues Dr Leana Wen, a former health commissioner for Baltimore, who calls the decision “a major blunder” and “an unforced error.” Dr Howard Koh, a former health commissioner for Massachusetts, is less pessimistic. He thinks that the statement underscored the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing disease and death. The cdc is giving a public signal that “the end of our public-health marathon is in sight,” Dr Koh reckons.</p><p>Whatever the wisdom of the announcement, it has probably created a disincentive for holdouts to get the jab. Vaccination rates have slowed and only 38% of Americans are fully vaccinated. Many state and local governments planned to use dropping mask requirements as a carrot for vaccination. Before the change in guidance, Minnesota’s state government had announced that mask requirements would be removed by July 1st, or once 70% of the eligible population was vaccinated. But amid prodding from Republican state legislators after the statement from the cdc, masks are now no longer required in Minnesota regardless of vaccination status, except for child-care settings and schools.</p><p>Maryland’s state government also removed its mask guidance, reneguing on its plan to take off the masks once vaccination reached 70%. Several other states, including New York, Virginia, Kentucky and Michigan have also ended mask requirements for vaccinated Americans, though none has outlined procedures for determining vaccination status. By implementing a policy for vaccinated people without guidance on how to check for vaccination status, the cdc has essentially removed masks for everyone.</p><p>That means state and local governments will have to get more creative. New Orleans’s health department teamed up with Cajun Seafood, a local seafood market, to offer a pound of free boiled crayfish with a jab. Maine is giving away free fishing or hunting licenses. Younger West Virginians can get a $100 savings bond if they get a vaccination. In Buffalo, a city in upstate New York, a “Shot and a chaser” pop-up vaccination site is offering free beer. The site vaccinated more people in one day than the other sites in the county combined did in a week.</p><p>Dr Koh is still optimistic that the country will reach herd immunity, despite the cdc’s zigzags. As for the latest criticism of the agency, he thinks people will soon get comfortable with the policy. “Change, even positive change, can be unsettling. I think that’s where we are right now.”</p><p><a id="why-tech-firms-are-trying-to-run-away-from-politics%E2%80%94and-failing"></a></p><h1 id="Why-tech-firms-are-trying-to-run-away-from-politics—and-failing"><a href="#Why-tech-firms-are-trying-to-run-away-from-politics—and-failing" class="headerlink" title="Why tech firms are trying to run away from politics—and failing"></a>Why tech firms are trying to run away from politics—and failing</h1><p>As other firms become more political, some Silicon Valley companies are heading in the opposite direction</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>When at work, steer clear of politics. This rule, generally accepted around the world, does not apply in techland. Employees bring their “whole self to work”, including their political beliefs. Internal online forums are full of heated debates about social issues, ranging from sexual harassment to police brutality. Some firms have started to push back. Facebook, Google and Shopify discourage political debates on their internal message boards. Basecamp, a small but culturally influential maker of web software, recently caused a stir when it declared itself a politics-free zone, as Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, had a few months earlier.</p><p>Last week even Apple, otherwise famously focused on its products, got caught up in the debate. It fired a well-known new staff member, Antonio García Martínez, after employees circulated a petition highlighting the supposedly misogynistic tone of a book he penned in 2016 mocking life in Silicon Valley. And last week Alphabet, Google’s parent, had to deal with another internal petition circulating among employees, this one calling on the firm’s leadership to make a statement “recognising the violence in Palestine and Israel”.</p><p>Digital technology has always had a political bent, starting with firms such as Apple, which have their roots in the 1960s counterculture. Technological shifts have tended to be framed in political terms, as was the case with open-source software, which initially had an anti-capitalist impetus. More recently, to attract top employees, tech firms have felt obliged to offer plenty of perks, such as free food, but also “work that aligns with personal values”, says Jennifer Kim, a noted startup adviser. Such expectations also explain why bosses of big tech firms pipe up on issues ranging from immigration to misinformation.</p><p>But lately the pendulum has started to swing back. One reason is that more than in other sectors, discussions in tech firms mostly take place over Slack and other corporate communication services—not ideal forums in which to advance nuanced arguments. This has been a problem in large tech firms particularly, which is why Google and Facebook now have moderators to keep internal online debates from getting out of hand.</p><p>Stir in defensive management and hyper-critical workers, and it is easy to see why some firms have blown up. That seems to have been the case with Basecamp, whose two founders were hitherto mostly known for their books about a saner startup life. After a series of internal conflicts, Jason Fried, one founder, wrote a memo banning political debates on Basecamp’s systems. “It’s a major distraction. It saps our energy, and redirects our dialogue towards dark places,” he argued.</p><p>But even if they wanted to, most tech firms can only go so far in pushing back. Coinbase and Basecamp, which each lost 60 employees after their bosses changed the rules, have apparently been inundated with applications from people wanting to work for politics-free firms. Yet the pool of such workers appears to be limited: according to a new Harris poll commissioned by Paradigm, a diversity consultancy, more than two-thirds of adults in America want to be able to discuss racial-justice issues at work. For better or for worse, workers in tech will be talking politics for a long time to come. </p><p><a id="philadelphia-reckons-with-the-day-its-police-force-bombed-a-house"></a></p><h1 id="Philadelphia-reckons-with-the-day-its-police-force-bombed-a-house"><a href="#Philadelphia-reckons-with-the-day-its-police-force-bombed-a-house" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia reckons with the day its police force bombed a house"></a>Philadelphia reckons with the day its police force bombed a house</h1><p>36 years later, the aftershocks are still being felt</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On may 13th 1985, 500 police officers surrounded a row house in West Philadelphia. Inside, members of move, an eccentric black liberation and back-to-nature religious group, barricaded the doors and windows. The police and members of move exchanged fire. Police officers fired thousands of rounds of ammunition as well as tear-gas into the house. Then the police department dropped an explosive onto the house from a helicopter, knowing there were children inside. The subsequent fire destroyed more than 60 neighbouring houses, leaving 250 people homeless. The police commissioner ordered the fire department to “let it burn”. Eleven people died, including five children. A special investigation commission in 1986 called the bombing “reckless, ill-conceived” and “unconscionable”.</p><p>Though this episode is perhaps not as well-known as it should be, the aftershocks of it are still being felt. On the 36th anniversary of the bombing, which fell last week, Thomas Farley, Philadelphia’s health commissioner, resigned after Jim Kenney, Philadelphia’s mayor, found out that he had ordered the remains of one or more victims, which were still in the city’s possession, to be cremated and discarded. He had not contacted family members, who had thought the bodies were buried decades ago. The mayor said Dr Farley’s actions “lacked empathy”. The next day Mr Kenney said that the remains had in fact been discovered by the medical examiner’s staff. Apparently an underling disobeyed the order; City Hall has promised an investigation.</p><p>This followed a discovery last month by Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, who wrote in the Philadelphia Inquirer that University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University anthropologists had been using the bones of an unidentified victim of the move bombing in classes. They were also used in an online course offered by Princeton called “Real Bones: Adventures in Forensic Anthropology”. The universities have apologised and say they will reunite the remains with the family. “I could not have imagined that 36 years later they would be displaying our family as if they’re some dinosaur relics that they dug up,” Mike Africa junior told Billy Penn, a local news website. Mr Africa was a child in 1985, and not at home the day his house was bombed.</p><p>The move bombing was largely forgotten. Richard Kent Evans, author of “move: An American Religion”, speculates that “it was forgotten because it is unthinkable”. Last year the city council issued a formal apology for the events 36 years ago. For Mr Africa, the family’s spokesperson, not enough has changed since 1985. The city is still very segregated. Many African-Americans are still poor. He described the treatment of the remains as “immoral. It’s horrific. It’s insensitive. It’s racist.”</p><p><a id="ohow-many-american-children-have-cut-contact-with-their-parents"></a></p><h1 id="OHow-many-American-children-have-cut-contact-with-their-parents"><a href="#OHow-many-American-children-have-cut-contact-with-their-parents" class="headerlink" title="OHow many American children have cut contact with their parents?"></a>OHow many American children have cut contact with their parents?</h1><p>A young field of research suggests it is surprisingly common</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Unhappily married for many years, Peter (not his real name) waited until his children were grown up before he divorced their mother. He hoped this would make the experience less upsetting for them. Yet in the six years since, he has not seen either of his two sons. He speaks to the younger one, who is in his 20s, once or twice a year; the eldest, in his 30s, has cut off all contact. His middle child, a daughter, has at times tried to act as go-between, an experience she has found distressing. “For me it has been completely devastating,” he says. “I get on with my life, but I get teary when I think about them.” Losing contact with children is like bereavement, he says, but with the painful tug of hope that they might one day be reconciled.</p><p>Though people tend not to talk about it much, familial estrangement seems to be widespread in America. The first large-scale nationwide survey, recently conducted by Cornell University, found that 27% of adult Americans are estranged from a close family member. Karl Pillemer, a professor of sociology who led the research and wrote a book about its findings called “Fault Lines”, says that because people often feel shame, the real figure is likely to be higher. The relationship most commonly severed is that between parent and adult child, and in most cases it is the child who wields the knife.</p><p>Because family estrangement has been a subject of research only for the past decade there are no data to show whether it is becoming more common. But many sociologists and psychologists think it is. In one way this seems surprising. Divorce heightens the risk of other family fractures. Joshua Coleman, a psychologist and the author of “Rules of Estrangement”, found in a recent survey of 1,600 estranged parents that more than 70% had divorced their child’s other parent (children of divorce are more likely to dump their fathers, he notes). In recent years America’s divorce rate has fallen. Yet Dr Coleman reckons other trends are making parent-child estrangements likelier than ever. Other therapists, who do not specialise in family rifts, concur.</p><p>Me, myself and I<br>A rise in individualism that emphasises personal happiness is the biggest factor. People are increasingly likely to reject relatives who obstruct feelings of well-being in some way, by holding clashing beliefs or failing to embrace those of others. Personal fulfilment has increasingly come to displace filial duty, says Dr Coleman. Whereas families have always fought and relatives fallen out, he says, the idea of cutting oneself off from a relative as a path to one’s own happiness seems to be new. In some ways it is a positive development: people find it easier to separate from parents who have been abusive. But it can also carry heavy costs.</p><p>More individualistic than most rich countries, America also has a higher divorce rate. This suggests adult-child separation is more common in America than it is in other places. “My impression is that this isn’t considered much of a problem in many European countries,” says Dr Pillemer. Geography also plays a part. Though people move from state to state less than they used to, America remains one of the most geographically mobile countries in the world. The vast distances often involved allow people who want to leave their families behind to do so. Peter reckons that if he and his younger son, who live hundreds of miles apart, still lived in the same city they would have patched things up by now. That, in turn, might have softened his older son. “If two out of three were talking to me, I wonder if he might think again,” he says.</p><p>Those who decide to break off contact with their parents find support in a growing body of books (often with the word “toxic” in the title), as well as online. Threads on internet forums for people who want to break ties with their parents reveal strangers labelling people they have never met as narcissistic or toxic and advising an immediate cessation of contact. This may make it easier to shelve feelings of guilt.</p><p>Therapy has played a role too, says Dr Coleman. A lot of therapy in America emphasises the role family dysfunction plays in personal unhappiness. Though it is often a factor, it is also often not, he says. “As therapists we need to do due diligence on what our patients say. Just as I wouldn’t take at face value a parent’s depiction of their parenting as flawless, I wouldn’t assume an adult child’s claim that a parent is ‘toxic’ should be accepted without further inquiry,” he says. He is launching an online programme with a British researcher that helps therapists and others develop techniques for working with those who have become estranged from close relatives.</p><p>Raising awareness about the issue in this way is likely to be important, and not only because some broken bonds may be fixable. Parent-child estrangement has negative effects beyond the heartbreak it causes. Research suggests that the habit of cutting off relatives is likely to spread in families. But most immediately, it is likely to exacerbate loneliness in old age.</p><p>Dr Pillemer, who is also a professor of gerontology in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, says the idea for the research was sparked by a one-to-one survey he did of elderly people. “I discovered that dozens had been cut off by their children,” he says. Often, they did not want to admit it. People who work with the elderly should consider the possibility, he says, that an old person is not receiving the support and solace that might be assumed about someone who has adult children. “Mrs Smith may say she has two daughters,” he says. “She is quite likely not to add that she never sees them.”</p><p><a id="joe%E2%80%99s-modest-middle-east-medicine"></a></p><h1 id="Joe’s-modest-Middle-East-medicine"><a href="#Joe’s-modest-Middle-East-medicine" class="headerlink" title="Joe’s modest Middle East medicine"></a>Joe’s modest Middle East medicine</h1><p>The Biden administration’s foreign policy realism leaves little room for peacemaking</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Donald trump tried to be as different from Barack Obama as possible. But on the Middle East he ended up in the same place. In their different ways, both men tried and failed to reduce America’s commitments in the region. Joe Biden has the same aim—and has emphasised his alternative priorities, China and the climate, even more clearly than his predecessors did. The current violence between Israelis and Palestinians, the worst since 2014, is an early test of his prospects of succeeding where they fell short.</p><p>It will not be, as some progressives claim, by ditching the Palestinians as Mr Trump did. In the first weeks of his presidency Mr Biden restored $250m of aid to them that his predecessor had cut, promised to reopen the de facto American consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem that Mr Trump had closed and restated his support for a Palestinian state, on which the Republican president was ambivalent. Yet Mr Biden shares the consensus view that no resolution is possible under today’s Israeli and Palestinian leadership. And as he previously signalled in Afghanistan, he has little time for a losing cause.</p><p>That sets him apart from Mr Obama. By his second term Mr Biden’s Democratic predecessor also believed that a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was less possible and less important to regional stability than he had once thought. Yet he suffered his more hopeful secretary of state, John Kerry, to launch a round of peace diplomacy anyhow; just as Mr Obama had previously been swayed to overcome his scepticism and intervene in Libya and double down in Afghanistan. Mr Biden, no fan of those efforts at the time and a witness to the failures they became, already appears unswayable. He has set his stall out to be the first president not to launch a Middle East peace initiative since Gerald Ford. In the Washington, dc, jargon: “He is not interested in a Nobel prize.”</p><p>This attitude helps explain the administration’s slowness to respond to the tensions in East Jerusalem this month, after protests against the anticipated court-ordered eviction of six Palestinian families turned violent. It took three days for Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, to discuss the escalating conflict with his Israeli counterpart, by which time it had already become a heated international issue. It was a flat-footed response, revealing the tension inherent in “deprioritising” a volatile region of persistent geopolitical and domestic significance. It is a strategy that requires the close attention and nimble diplomacy that America’s generally reserves for its highest priorities.</p><p>It is also a strategy supportive of the status quo, as has been apparent in the administration’s delicate subsequent handling of Israel after it returned Hamas’s rockets with salvoes of missiles into Gaza. Left-wing Democrats such as Representative Rashida Tlaib urged Mr Biden to raise the heat on Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. To the contrary, the administration has not explicitly called for a ceasefire or allowed the un Security Council to do so, both of which Mr Obama might well have done. Besides Mr Biden’s longstanding commitment to the Jewish state’s security—as a rare Democratic Zionist—this also reflects the administration’s reluctance to involve itself in the crisis more than it must.</p><p>Aggravating as it has been to Ms Tlaib, and to around a quarter of congressional Democrats overall, the administration considers its quiet diplomacy to be the most practical way to stop the Israelis going too far. It reasons that the Obama administration’s imprecations against Mr Netanyahu did not improve him. Better, it thinks, to store up leverage with the Israeli leader by supporting him early in the crisis in order to try to curtail it later on. Similarly, the administration considers the growing antipathy towards Israel among progressives to be primarily another source of potential leverage for it to use against Mr Netanyahu.</p><p>That seems a reasonable calculation. In an otherwise drearily familiar conflict, the pro-Palestinian shift among Democrats is novel and, for Israel, ominous. It may augur a hostile future president and the Middle East becoming an even more partisan issue than Mr Trump made it. The willingness of some pro-Israel Democrats, such as Senator Robert Menendez, to join their colleagues in criticising Israel’s use of force in Gaza underlines that. But provided the conflict does not drag on, the pressure on Mr Biden from his party looks insufficient to change his low-key tactics. A pro-Israel resolution would still sail through Congress.</p><p>Given its ambition to restore the Iran nuclear agreement, the administration may be more concerned about how its efforts are received in the region. The Iranians and their proxies will view them as a test of its diplomatic mettle. Israel, Saudi Arabia and other potential spoilers of the Iran negotiation are meanwhile appraising Mr Biden’s willingness to stand by traditional allies—a quality they doubted in Mr Obama.</p><p>War and crisis management<br>On both measures, the administration’s early efforts in the Middle East appear, after their slow start, to be going satisfactorily. As Lexington went to press, the conflict in Gaza seemed on course to end in days not, as in 2014, weeks. That would be in accordance with Mr Biden’s reported “private” advice to Mr Netanyahu. It would also be in line with America’s advice to the Palestinians, conducted through Egypt, another ally Mr Obama was considered to have gone wobbly on. As an early proof of Mr Biden’s theory that America can achieve more by traditional statecraft than unilateralism, he could not ask for much more.</p><p>Such progress is inevitably fragile. The stability of the Middle East is determined far more by local circumstances than American action, which is another fact guiding Mr Biden’s non-committal approach. Yet the corollary is that America has little control over when the locals turn what is now a second-order issue for America into a first-order one, as they have this month. That persistent reality should keep Mr Biden on his toes.</p>]]></content>

How can that be done?</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>When george floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin a year ago, the sense of injustice was tinged with despair. Why, many Americans asked, is this still happening in our country? Why, many foreigners asked, does the story of race in America never seem to change? Except this time was different. Mr Floyd’s death prompted the biggest civil-rights protests in American history. Mr Chauvin, unusually, was convicted of murder. And institutions in America and beyond looked at themselves in a different light. Something needed to change. But what exactly?</p><p>The Biden administration and the Democratic Party have made reducing racial disparities an organising principle of government. That sounds straightforward, but it is not. Despite the gains in legal and political rights made by African-Americans since the civil-rights era, measures of relative poverty and black-white segregation have barely moved for half a century. Tackling enduring injustices requires clear thinking about their causes.</p><p>Most racial disparities come about when three things collide: secular economic trends, the aftershocks of slavery and segregation and present-day bigotry and racism. The first two are usually the biggest causes of bad outcomes for African-Americans, but the third—racism today—gets most of the attention.</p><p>This is backwards. Covid-19 has killed African-Americans at higher rates than whites or Asian-Americans. The causes are still unclear, but the blame is unlikely to lie with racist doctors, nurses and insurers. Instead, for reasons that include past racism and present-day poverty, African-Americans are more likely to suffer from pre-existing conditions and to have to work outside the safety of their homes, and less likely to have health insurance.</p><p>Racism remains a curse in America, though it is less widespread than 30 years ago, let alone in the civil-rights era. But, since it is lodged in bigoted minds, rooting it out is largely beyond the power of any government. Poverty and the structural legacy of racism in institutions are different. Take the Biden administration’s new child tax credit, which looks likely to reduce child poverty by 40%. Because African-Americans are disproportionately poor, this race-neutral policy should halve the number of poor black children.</p><p>Given that the problem is racial disparities, why not target help directly at African-Americans instead? One reason is practical. People are more likely to support measures that they themselves might benefit from. The child tax credit enjoys broad backing. Were it designed to benefit only one group, support for it would plummet. Any administration that targeted policies on African-Americans alone—using, say, reparations and more affirmative action—would soon be out of power.</p><p>By contrast, policies that help all poor Americans are popular and effective. Since the Affordable Care Act in 2010, 39 states have expanded the availability of Medicaid, the health-insurance programme for low-income Americans. As a result, the share of uninsured African-Americans has fallen by 40% over a decade. A government that wanted to spend more could provide baby bonds for poor Americans and vouchers to move out of areas of concentrated poverty. A government less inclined to spend could relax zoning rules, making it easier to build apartments near good schools. None of these policies is race-based, but all of them would greatly reduce the disparity of outcomes.</p><p>These broad-based policies are not just practical, but moral too. Racial injustice is particularly searing in America because of the horrors of slavery, the violence of Reconstruction and the institutionalised racism of Jim Crow. African-Americans have had legal rights to vote, to marry whom they want and to live where they choose for just the span of a single lifetime.</p><p>Yet not all African-Americans need help. Despite the disadvantages they face, the country’s large, thriving black middle class is often overlooked in talk of race in America. Moreover, people who are not black also face prejudice and inherited disadvantages. How much better if government policy lessens Latino, Native American, Asian and white poverty, too. To deny aid to people in the name of racial justice would be perverse.</p><p>What is true of poverty is also true of police reform. Here there have been notable advances in the past year, as cities and states have trimmed “qualified immunity”, a broad defence available to police officers who kill civilians. Police killings of unarmed young men are often presented as overwhelmingly a racial issue, because police officers kill a disproportionate number of African-Americans. Even before Mr Floyd’s murder, the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Eric Garner in New York and Breonna Taylor in Louisville rightly brought attention to this fact.</p><p>Yet police officers kill Americans of all races more often than they should. Separating the many police shootings that are justified from those that should never have happened ought to be a national priority. This would be easier if policing was understood as a civil-rights issue affecting all Americans.</p><p>A race-neutral approach will not always work. To create more diverse organisations, companies, all too often run by white people, need to pay more attention to race in hiring. Unless elite universities take positive steps, their intake will not be representative of the country. But where practical, a race-neutral approach to opening up opportunities is more likely to help America—and especially its African-American citizens.</p><p>One year on from a terrible injustice, the United States is confronting not just its past but its future, too. In the next 50 years it will be the first big, rich country where no single racial group, ethnicity or religious denomination will be in the majority. The more politicians exploit the tribal fears of some voters, the more turbulent this transition will be. The Republican Party’s enthusiasm for rewriting voting rules in states such as Arizona and Georgia shows how democracy could suffer.</p><p>Yet America also has the chance to set an example to other countries. A smooth transition is more likely if politics is not set up as a fight for resources between groups that people are born into and cannot leave. Instead, the country can make common cause to shrink enduring racial disparities while helping all Americans leave injustices behind. That must be the aim. </p><p><a id="what-to-do-about-a-labour-crunch"></a></p><h1 id="What-to-do-about-a-labour-crunch"><a href="#What-to-do-about-a-labour-crunch" class="headerlink" title="What to do about a labour crunch"></a>What to do about a labour crunch</h1><p>Across the rich world vacancies are left unfilled</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As rich countries loosen lockdowns, an economic puzzle is emerging. Businesses are voicing ever-louder concerns about labour shortages, even as millions of people remain out of work. In America a surge of spending is creating job openings, but few people seem willing to fill them. The number of vacancies, at over 8m, has never been so high.</p><p>Worker shortages are a growing problem elsewhere, too. British publicans, who opened their doors to indoor drinkers on May 17th, are searching for pint-pullers. In Australia vacancies are 40% above their pre-pandemic level. Europe has been slower to come out of its lockdown, but even there unfilled positions from Switzerland to Germany are higher than before.</p><p>Some see news of worker shortages as welcome. If human labour is still in demand, then perhaps predictions of job-killing robots were wrong. Company managers are also having to work harder to attract staff. McDonald’s is boosting wages; England’s pubs are ditching qualification requirements; other firms are paying people just to show up for an interview. Underlying pay growth is strong, at more than 3% in America. A good thing, you might say. After a year of lockdowns, who would begrudge workers a rise?</p><p>That is to ignore the downsides of labour-market snarl-ups. A bidding war between employers could yet cause an inflationary spiral. And shortages ricochet around the economy. A builder that cannot find labourers will put up fewer new houses, in turn hitting decorators. Businesses that are still recovering from the crisis may face another financial blow.</p><p>High inflation and bankruptcies may never happen. But today’s worker shortages are also an enormous waste of talent. Including those on furlough schemes, we estimate that 30m fewer people in the rich world are working than before the pandemic. For so many people to be idle comes at a huge cost, not only in lost wages but also in terms of their health and dignity.</p><p>To get labour markets working better, governments should consider three P’s: payments, passports and patience. Take payments first. In America businesspeople, almost to a pinstripe, are convinced that the $300-a-week boost to unemployment insurance (ui) explains the shortages. However, pundits do not agree on whether stimulus handouts really lead people to shirk.</p><p>The evidence is hazy elsewhere, too. It might seem natural that British pot-washers would prefer to earn 80% of their salary on furlough than stand in a hot kitchen for 12 hours a day for 100% of it. However, Australia ditched its job-protection scheme in March, and shortages have worsened.</p><p>Given this uncertainty, the solution is not to slash welfare but to redesign it so as to encourage work. Arizona is reallocating some of the money used for ui, instead offering $2,000 payments to folk who move into a full-time job. The evidence on back-to-work bonuses from past recessions is encouraging.</p><p>Next is passports, which relates to immigration. Temporary border controls to stop the virus make sense, but they should not last beyond the pandemic. In New Zealand annual net migration has fallen from 92,000 to 7,000. Australia is losing migrants. Britain is also reckoning with Brexit-related immigration changes. That is why in many countries industries, such as hospitality, that rely on foreigners face the most acute shortages. Politicians must be clear that closed borders will come with a painful price tag—or change tack.</p><p>The last requirement is patience. Many people are avoiding work because of fear of contracting covid-19. These concerns should fade as more of them are vaccinated. Some industries are seeing jobs wither, even as parts of the labour market, from delivery drivers to remote yoga tutors, boom. Faced with change on such a scale, people may take longer to find new careers. A misfiring jobs market is in no one’s interest. Time and the right policies will clear the blockages. </p><p><a id="italy-could-soon-get-a-hard-right-government"></a></p><h1 id="Italy-could-soon-get-a-hard-right-government"><a href="#Italy-could-soon-get-a-hard-right-government" class="headerlink" title="Italy could soon get a hard-right government"></a>Italy could soon get a hard-right government</h1><p>Worrying tremors are coming out of Europe’s most indebted economy</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In february we and many others breathed a sigh of relief after Mario Draghi agreed to become prime minister of Italy. For had not “super Mario” saved the euro, in 2012, with his promise that he, and the European Central Bank he then headed, would do “whatever it takes” to stop the project unravelling? Those three words were enough to calm markets, bringing down interest rates on the debt of the zone’s weaker members. Over the nine years since then, those countries have saved tens of billions of euros thanks to reduced borrowing costs.</p><p>With Mr Draghi at the helm, the yield on Italian debt is currently only around 1.2 percentage points above that of Germany. The government he leads can count on a large majority of seats in parliament, and the European Commission is about to start releasing a whopping €200bn ($245bn) or so in covid-19 recovery funds, to be paid out over the next three to four years. That sum is equivalent to 12% of Italy’s annual gdp, a tidy stimulus by anyone’s standards but Joe Biden’s. The commission has been broadly satisfied by the promises Mr Draghi has made about how he will spend the money, and the reforms to Italy’s sclerotic government that he will aim to undertake. So far, then, so good.</p><p>Yet Italian politics remain unpredictable. A recent uptick in the number of migrants arriving by boat, mostly to the Italian island of Lampedusa, has generated alarmist headlines. Some 13,000 have arrived so far this year, triple the tally this time a year ago. That is far below the peak of 180,000 for the whole of 2016, but the sailing season has only just begun. Already, populist politicians have seized on the issue, and will milk it if numbers continue to climb. (An influx of migrants to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta is a headache for the Socialist government in Spain, too.)</p><p>A tense battle is now being fought for dominance on Italy’s nationalist right. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the hard-right Northern League, finds himself in a perilous position, as his party has lost support to an even more radical outfit, the Brothers of Italy (fdi), a descendant of the Italian Social Movement founded in 1946 by ex-supporters of Benito Mussolini. Mr Salvini quit the government in 2019 in a failed attempt to trigger an early election that he might very well have won. His party is still the most popular in Italy’s fragmented political landscape, say pollsters. But Giorgia Meloni’s fdi is catching up.</p><p>The fdi is the only one of Italy’s main parties not to have backed Mr Draghi’s government, and that seems to be doing it no harm in a country where many still distrust bankers and Brussels. It may not be long before the fdi overtakes the League. In some polls it has already passed the main party of the centre-left, the Democrats, now led by Enrico Letta, a competent man who was briefly prime minister in 2013-14.</p><p>Together the League and the fdi may now have enough votes to form a government, especially if they can rope in a maverick former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Both parties are nativist and suspicious of the eu, though neither advocates Italexit.</p><p>Italian mps may not have to face the electorate for another two years; an election must take place in May 2023 at the latest. But one could come a lot sooner. Those who know him say Mr Draghi is keen to be Italy’s next president. That job comes up for grabs next February, but some hoped that the incumbent, Sergio Mattarella, might agree to stand again and make way for Mr Draghi later. This week he appeared to rule that out.</p><p>The relentless rise of Italy’s Brothers, and Mr Salvini’s need to tack to the right to match them, is a reminder that clenched-fist nationalism remains popular with many voters in the European Union. Although this has never been in doubt in Poland and Hungary, it is true in western Europe, too. Some recent polls have France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, in a virtual dead-heat with Marine Le Pen, his blood-and-soil rival, in a putative second-round match-up next year. In Spain the opposition People’s Party is seeking a deal with Vox, a hard-right newcomer, to form a government for the Madrid region.</p><p>Europe’s governments have collectively and individually struggled with the covid-19 pandemic, mishandling the early stages of vaccination and the most recent wave of infection. A season of elections is beginning, and incumbents look as if they may see some nasty surprises. One in Italy, which sits on Europe’s largest stock of debt, would be calamitous indeed. </p><p><a id="sustainable-finance-is-rife-with-greenwash-time-for-more-disclosure"></a></p><h1 id="Sustainable-finance-is-rife-with-greenwash-Time-for-more-disclosure"><a href="#Sustainable-finance-is-rife-with-greenwash-Time-for-more-disclosure" class="headerlink" title="Sustainable finance is rife with greenwash.

Time for more disclosure</h1><p>Supposedly green and cuddly funds are stuffed full of polluters and sin stocks</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Investors are all too familiar with the rise of Tesla. Shares in the electric-vehicle maker are now worth nearly nine times what they were at the start of 2019. But it is not an exception. As political leaders across the world start to send clearer signals about their willingness to tackle climate change, the private sector is getting enthused, too, and a green boom is under way.</p><p>Over 40 green firms have seen their share prices triple since the start of 2019. Six have outperformed Tesla. The beneficiaries include all manner of emission-sparing companies, from solar-panel firms to makers of hydrogen fuel cells.</p><p>Meanwhile many big companies in other industries have taken to boasting about their green credentials. Renewable-energy shares have paused in recent weeks, in part because investors worry about the prospect of higher interest rates, but other assets have taken off. In Europe the price of carbon has soared to a record high. The prices of metals, such as copper and lithium, that are used in electric cars, are spiking as well.</p><p>The boom reflects soaring demand from investors. Everyone from oil majors to day-traders on WallStreetBets is splurging on climate-friendly projects and securities. Meanwhile the asset-management industry is marketing a style of investing that purports to take into account environmental, social and governance (esg) factors. So far this year, inflows into esg funds accounted for about a quarter of the total, up from a tenth in 2018. On average, two new esg funds are launched every day.</p><p>Unfortunately the boom has been accompanied by rampant “greenwashing”. This week The Economist crunches the numbers on the world’s 20 biggest esg funds. On average, each of them holds investments in 17 fossil-fuel producers. Six have invested in ExxonMobil, America’s biggest oil firm. Two own stakes in Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer. One fund holds a Chinese coal-mining company. esg investing is hardly a champion of social virtue either. The funds we looked at invest in gambling, booze and tobacco.</p><p>Governments are starting to pay attention. Under Donald Trump, American regulators tried to hobble esg investing, which the White House saw as a left-wing conspiracy. By contrast, President Joe Biden’s administration sees it as a potentially useful weapon to fight climate change. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street’s regulator, worries that esg funds are misleading investors.</p><p>What should governments do? One possibility is to follow the European Union’s approach. Its latest Green Deal includes lots of new rules about sustainable finance. Underpinning them is an elaborate state-directed taxonomy which covers some 70 different activities and aims to tell investors what is green and what is not. Inevitably, the effort has run into trouble. Countries have been furiously lobbying the European Commission to ensure that their favoured source of energy is labelled as green. Poland and Romania, among others, want natural gas to be added to the green list, because they are planning to use it to replace coal.</p><p>Rather than the eu playing God, investors can decide for themselves what is green. But they need a big improvement in corporate disclosure. The current system of largely voluntary reporting is riddled with problems. Firms disclose reams of irrelevant puffery, while often failing to reveal the few things that matter. Ideally, an asset manager would be able to work out the carbon footprint of their portfolio and how it might change over time. But many firms fail to disclose their emissions rigorously and often the measures made public by individual firms overlap, leading to double-counting when you add them all up.</p><p>A better system would force companies to reveal their full carbon footprint, including emissions from the products they sell and the goods and services they buy. It would help if big polluters also revealed how they expect their footprint to change and the amount of capital expenditure that goes toward low-carbon investments. That way an investor could work out how much pollution their portfolio is responsible for today and how it might look tomorrow.</p><p>The results of such disclosure may come as a surprise. We estimate that listed firms that are not state-controlled account for only 14-32% of the world’s emissions—so green investing can be only part of the answer. About 5% of these firms account for over 80% of the total emissions. They are mostly oil producers, utilities, cement firms and mining companies. Better disclosure would also show that only a tiny number of firms are investing heavily in renewable energy or breakthrough technologies.</p><p>The combined effect would be to expose as bunk the idea that swathes of the corporate world and asset-management industry are planet-saving heroes. And it would help investors put their money into truly green firms, ensuring a better allocation of capital and a faster energy transition. </p><p><a id="eritrea-africa%E2%80%99s-gulag-state-is-on-the-march"></a></p><h1 id="Eritrea-Africa’s-gulag-state-is-on-the-march"><a href="#Eritrea-Africa’s-gulag-state-is-on-the-march" class="headerlink" title="Eritrea, Africa’s gulag state, is on the march"></a>Eritrea, Africa’s gulag state, is on the march</h1><p>President Issaias Afwerki is fanning war and undermining democracy across the region</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It is an unlikely pairing. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, is young, charismatic and says he is committed to democracy in Africa’s second-most-populous country. Until war erupted in November in Tigray, a northern region, he was a darling of the world. In 2019 he won the Nobel peace prize for ending a war with Eritrea. Yet he is now knee-deep in blood alongside Eritrea’s president, Issaias Afwerki, an ageing dictator who locks up dissidents in shipping crates in the desert.</p><p>When the two leaders met to sign a peace deal in 2018, many hoped their reconciliation would reshape the region. Abiy was liberalising Ethiopia, releasing political prisoners and freeing the press. Some thought Issaias might learn from his new friend. Outsiders rushed to encourage the thaw. The un lifted an arms embargo (imposed because of Eritrea’s support for jihadists in Somalia). Western donors poured in cash. Eritrea’s decades of isolation seemed about to end. “Love is greater than modern weapons like tanks,” declared Abiy on his first visit to Asmara, Eritrea’s capital.</p><p>The bromance has indeed changed the region, but not in the way many had hoped. It seems that Issaias influenced Abiy, rather than vice versa. Encouraged by Issaias, and emboldened by promises of Eritrean military support, Abiy sent troops into Tigray for what he hoped would be a quick “law enforcement” operation against its rebellious ruling party which had attacked federal bases. The fighting has since turned into a bloody stalemate. Ethiopian and Eritrean troops control the cities and, intermittently, the main roads. Tigrayan rebels control much of the rest. Stuck in the middle are millions of starving civilians.</p><p>Eritrean troops, sometimes accompanied by those of the Ethiopian government and its militias, are pulling unarmed Tigrayan men from their homes, churches or buses and shooting them. Soldiers are methodically raping Tigrayan women. To cut supplies to the rebels, they are blocking food convoys and preventing farmers from planting crops. Around 4.5m of Tigray’s 6m people need food aid, says the un.</p><p>The only winner is Issaias. His troops, who died in their tens of thousands in their unsuccessful border war with Ethiopia, are now deep inside their neighbour’s territory. They have massed troops along parts of Ethiopia’s border with Sudan, threatening to inflame a separate dispute between those two countries. More worrying is that Issaias seems to be trying to export his model of despotic rule.</p><p>He is said to have egged on a power grab by Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, Somalia’s president, who has stayed in office despite his term having ended in February. To back his man in Mogadishu, Issaias has trained a Praetorian guard loyal to Mr Mohamed. “Issaias is the Svengali of this affair,” says a foreign diplomat. “He’s been unyielding in pushing a centralised state and bugger having elections.”</p><p>Western governments are belatedly waking up to the horrors in Tigray. In April the European Union cancelled €100m ($122m) of aid that would have gone to Eritrea. In March it imposed financial sanctions on Eritrea’s intelligence agency. Diplomats say that wider American and eu sanctions may be imposed soon.</p><p>Few hold out much hope that sanctions will sway Issaias, whose state is already largely cut off from the world. But sanctions, or even a credible threat of them, would provide greater leverage over Abiy, who needs access to export markets and international finance if Ethiopia is to grow quickly enough to quell protests by its young and restless population. Abiy can probably be convinced to ditch Issaias if the costs of their alliance become too high. Donors should therefore press Abiy harder.</p><p>Without his new ally, Issaias would have less clout in the region. There is not much, alas, that outsiders can do to make him less cruel to his own oppressed people, though neighbours and rich countries can and should grant them asylum if they flee his gulag state. Even if Issaias cannot be persuaded to change his ways, he can be prevented from remaking the Horn of Africa in his own tyrannical image. </p><p><a id="briefing---how-israel-and-hamas-returned-to-armed-conflict"></a></p><h1 id="Briefing-—How-Israel-and-Hamas-returned-to-armed-conflict"><a href="#Briefing-—How-Israel-and-Hamas-returned-to-armed-conflict" class="headerlink" title="(Briefing)—How Israel and Hamas returned to armed conflict"></a>(Briefing)—How Israel and Hamas returned to armed conflict</h1><p>Events in Jerusalem were the spark, but the recrudescence was all but inevitable</p><p>来源：2021-05-22 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Jerusalem day, an Israeli national holiday, fell on May 10th this year. The annual commemoration of Israel’s victory in 1967 was marked not just by a provocative nationalist march through the Old City, as it usually is, but also by a salvo of rockets fired towards the city by Hamas, the Islamist organisation that rules the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.</p><p>The bombardment triggered the fourth major round of fighting between Israel and Hamas since 2008. Hamas launched rockets at Israeli cities and towns at an unprecedented rate, killing a dozen people, while Israeli jets and helicopters pummelled already decrepit Gaza, killing over 200. On May 20th the violence began to ebb and after nightfall an official ceasefire was agreed on by both sides. It took effect in the early hours of the following day.</p><p>Tensions had been rising in Jerusalem for weeks as a result of restrictions imposed on Palestinians by Israeli police during the holy month of Ramadan and the possible expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes because of a contentious lawsuit. Protests around the city led to two days of violence at al-Aqsa mosque, with 90 Palestinians injured by police the day before the first rockets were launched. Hamas called its bombardment Saif al-Quds, “Sword of Jerusalem”. Israel gave its response a similarly city-specific name: Shomer Hahomot, “Guardian of the Walls”. If the trigger had not been Jerusalem, though, it would eventually have been something else; another iteration of the cycle of violence was all but inevitable.</p><p>As ever, the consequences have fallen most heavily on the 2m Palestinians trapped inside Gaza (see chart). Israel claims that since May 10th it has killed more than 150 fighters from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group. By the morning of May 20th, according to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 227 Gazans had been killed by Israeli strikes, among them 64 children and 38 women.</p><p>Residents describe the bombardment as the heaviest they have yet endured in the absence of a ground offensive. Israeli jets have blown up four high-rise towers, a scale of destruction it has been more hesitant to unleash in the past. The Galaa tower, brought down on May 15th, housed the bureaus of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera along with other offices and several floors of apartments. Israel asserts that one of those offices housed a branch of Hamas’s military intelligence division. Residents were warned of the attack and given an hour to flee; the building’s collapse was broadcast live on television.</p><p>There was no such warning on al-Wahda street, a busy thoroughfare in central Gaza City, early the next morning. An attack on a tunnel system—which Israel says hit targets some distance away—nevertheless saw a number of buildings collapse. More than 40 people were killed, among them 17 members of the same family. On May 15th Bob Menendez, the chairman of the American Senate’s foreign-relations committee—probably the most hawkish Democrat in the chamber—said the strike on the Galaa tower and the level of civilian deaths had left him “deeply troubled”.</p><p>All of this has pulverised the infrastructure of a place barely fit for human life to begin with. Israel and Egypt have kept Gaza under a blockade since 2007, with the movement of goods and people tightly restricted. With border crossings closed, the territory’s lone power plant is running short on diesel. Five of the ten power lines that supply Gaza with electricity from Israel have been damaged. In Beit Lahiya, in eastern Gaza, broken pipes sent sewage spilling into streets.</p><p>The blockade was originally meant to dislodge Hamas from power. But an isolated, impoverished territory in which 47% of the population is unemployed and most rely on foreign aid to survive has not had the wherewithal to kick it out; nor has Israel used its military might to do so. Binyamin Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for 12 of the 14 years since the blockade began, has insisted in private that Hamas’s control of the decrepit territory works in Israel’s favour. It weakens an already divided Palestinian leadership and reduces the prospect of a Palestinian state.</p><p>For all its pretensions as a resistance movement, Hamas has become an organisation focused on preserving its power and with little interest in alleviating misery. Many Gazans chafe under its authoritarian hand. According to a Palestinian pollster, a survey carried out in March found that 72% think Hamas is corrupt and 58% say they cannot criticise it without fear.</p><p>To the extent that Hamas still enjoys support, it is largely in comparison with the ageing, quiescent leadership of the Palestinian Authority (pa) which governs the West Bank. A forthcoming parliamentary election—the first since 2006—would have offered a way to change that, at least in theory. But Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the pa, found a pretext for cancelling the vote. Polls suggested that his party, Fatah, would fare poorly against Hamas and two splinter factions founded by disaffected Fatah members.</p><p>In the 17th year of what should have been a four-year term, Mr Abbas, 85, lacks both legitimacy and popularity. His pa has come to be seen as little more than a subcontractor for Israel’s occupation. He has reinforced that perception by cracking down on protests in the West Bank meant to show solidarity with Jerusalem and Gaza (protests in which 11 people have been killed). Even before that, the pollster says, 68% of Palestinians wanted him to resign.</p><p>If Hamas’s rockets are meant to show up Mr Abbas, though, they are not doing so through military effectiveness. Attacks from Gaza have killed just 12 people in Israel since May 10th, despite the furious tempo at which missiles have streaked across the sky. The 51 days of conflict in 2014 saw 4,400 rockets from Gaza strike Israel. As of May 19th this year some 4,000 had been launched, with perhaps 600 falling short within Gaza. Salvos of dozens of rockets at a time have been used in an attempt to overwhelm Iron Dome, Israel’s missile-defence system.</p><p>Under the dome<br>The defensive system’s sophistication has been scrawled across the sky. As seen from Ashkelon, 10km north of Gaza, the unguided missiles launched into Israel leave smoothly arcing lines of exhaust across the sky. Those from the Iron Dome batteries which oppose them rise like cobras, their paths swaying and twirling through the sky before ending in puffs of white smoke. At night the same story is told in glowing pyrotechnics.</p><p>The sinuous paths are testimony to what makes the system so formidable; not the interceptors themselves, but the battle-management system which puts them on constantly updated paths that maximise their chances of eventually taking out missiles heading for built-up areas.</p><p>Ten years since it was first deployed, the engineers at Rafael, one of Israel’s main defence contractors, are still tinkering with the system’s algorithms to improve its performance against large salvos. They seem to be doing well. On May 11th Hamas tried to saturate the system by launching a barrage of some 130 rockets towards greater Tel Aviv. Only a handful got through.</p><p>Besides saving lives, Israeli generals talk of the Iron Dome giving their politicians a “strategic advantage”; fewer casualties mean more room for manoeuvre when it comes to embarking on or ending military operations. But its success has drawbacks. The discrepancy between the death tolls on the protected Israeli and defenceless Palestinian sides increases the tenor of the international condemnation of Israel’s actions and throws into question whether its response has been proportionate. It also creates a possibly self-defeating sense of security among some Israeli citizens. Bomb shelters are not used as much as they were; more people remain vulnerable to the rockets that do get through.</p><p>If Iron Dome serves to protect Israel at home, President Joe Biden has filled a similar role abroad, refusing to place any public pressure on Mr Netanyahu’s government. America repeatedly blocked efforts at the un to issue a Security Council statement on the violence. It was a full week before Mr Biden used the word “ceasefire”, and when he did he was simply expressing his “support” for one, rather than demanding it. He dispatched an envoy, Hady Amr. But Mr Amr is hardly the sort of high-ranking emissary one dispatches to put about a bit of stick. The greatest international cost to Israel will probably be to see the process which led to the Abraham accords with Bahrain and the uae go no further. “It will make people who wanted to open up to Israel even more wary,” says Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to senior officials.</p><p>If Mr Biden does change his tone and demand a truce, it may well be moot. By the morning of May 20th barrages from Gaza had lessened, and were no longer aimed at Tel Aviv. The intensity of Israeli operations had also eased.</p><p>But if Israel still benefits from technology and American support, as it has for decades, the latest conflict has thrown up a new danger. The confrontations in Jerusalem brought about a wave of violence between the country’s Jews and Arabs.</p><p>Unlike Palestinians living in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem, the 2m Arabs living in Israel (21% of the population) have full citizenship and, in principle, full social benefits. They have the most to lose by resorting to violence and the highest expectations of the status quo; they rarely take part in violent protest. Yet in 2018 those expectations were dashed when the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, passed a “nation-state law” stating that “the right to exercise national self-determination” in Israel is “unique to the Jewish people”.</p><p>The dead zone<br>On May 10th Arabs attacked Jewish homes and synagogues in the city of Lod, near Tel Aviv. As with the attacks by Hamas, events in Jerusalem were not the sole driving force. “It’s only about 20% al-Aqsa and 80% poverty and inequality here in Lod,” said one local Arab resident. “It’s about how the local authority demolishes homes they claim were built illegally and about how the police don’t investigate murders within the Arab community. So much pressure has been building and now it’s burst.”</p><p>The violence quickly spread to other parts of the country. With the police caught napping, groups of far-right Jewish vigilantes joined the fray, launching attacks of their own on Arab drivers and businesses. After a few days of chaos the police clamped down. In Haifa, Israel’s third-largest city, a major riot was prevented on May 13th when police kept Jewish and Arab gangs apart. But the resentment will remain for years on both sides. “Normally I abhor these far-right vigilantes,” said a Jewish resident of Lod. “But they were here to protect my home when the mob came.”</p><p>This violence has coincided with, and probably derailed, what might have been a breakthrough in political engagement between the two communities. In the run-up to the most recent of the four general elections to have taken place in the past two years Ra’am, a conservative Muslim party, said that it was willing to support either Mr Netanyahu or his opponents under certain conditions. Having split away from the Joint List, an Arab electoral grouping which emphasises Palestinian nationalism, it won four seats in the Knesset. That exceeded expectations and demonstrated that a significant number of Arab-Israelis were prepared to trade their Palestinian identity off against their desire to integrate into Israeli society, at least to some extent.</p><p>Five days before hostilities broke out, Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, received a 28-day mandate to try to form a government. Mr Lapid and the other prospective leader of the new government, Naftali Bennett, who were planning to rotate the prime minister’s job between them, were to negotiate a coalition deal with Mansour Abbas, the head of Ra’am, on May 10th. That meeting was overtaken by events. Three days later Mr Bennett told Mr Lapid that he did not see a government being formed with Arab parties.</p><p>Mr Netanyahu, who has failed to secure a majority for his bloc of right-wing and religious parties at all four of the recent elections, has long used tensions between Jews and Arabs for political gain. In 2020, the last time a potential coalition with Arab parties was on the agenda, he branded their members as “terror supporters”. Now the riots, for all that they are in part a result of his politics, and for all that a breakdown in law and order reflects badly on a governing party, have made matters more difficult for his opponents. Hitting Hamas, meanwhile, goes down well with his base. He now looks likely to continue as caretaker prime minister until another set of elections in a few months.</p><p>Perhaps it seems odd that Hamas should give Mr Netanyahu a new lease of political life—but the group has long had a complicated relationship with Israel. It emerged in the 1980s from a network of religious charities across the occupied territories, and as such was permitted to operate with Israel’s blessing. Back then its brand of Islamism was seen as placid, more interested in preaching than fighting, and thus a useful counterweight to the secular militants who were the core of the Palestinian national movement. That logic proved faulty when in 1994, after the first intifada, or Palestinian uprising, Hamas adopted suicide-bombing as a tactic. Its militants would play a central role in the second intifada in the early 2000s.</p><p>Today, classified as a terrorist group by America, the eu and many of their allies, Hamas serves as a useful foil for Mr Netanyahu. He sees the periodic rounds of violence as a price worth paying for a divided and dysfunctional set of adversaries who share the blame for the squalor and despair in which their people live. Each new outbreak of indiscriminate rocket fire allows him to insist Israel has no partner for peace among the Palestinians.</p><p>Misery<br>And each time that, after counter-attacks, the rockets fall quiet, Hamas can claim a hollow victory from the mere fact of its survival. Some old Israeli generals grumble that a more “decisive” blow on Hamas could be landed if the Israeli forces invaded, rather than being content to protect the public with Iron Dome and bomb Gaza from the air. But though armoured and infantry units have been prepared in staging areas, Israel is not seriously considering a ground offensive this time around.</p><p>Since the ground incursions in 2009 and 2014 ended in thousands of casualties and massive devastation of civilian buildings and infrastructure, holding back would seem to be a good thing. For Israelis, however, it also means that, despite Mr Netanyahu’s past boasts, Hamas will stay in place, an issue only the Palestinians can resolve.</p><p>The Palestinians who are trapped in Gaza have a median age of 18. A generation which encompasses half the population has grown up knowing only blockade and war, with little chance of a decent life and little hope for escape. This round of fighting will end, just like the ones that came before. But for Gazans that will mean only a respite in which to try to rebuild—and the agonising certainty that it will all come crashing down again. </p>]]></content>

But will they last?</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>As america’s economy bounces back from the pandemic, aided by trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus, the main question on investors’ minds is if and when inflation will take off. The Federal Reserve has vowed to tolerate a period of above-target price rises so that the economy can get back on its feet; Jerome Powell, its chairman, has said it is “not even thinking about thinking” about raising interest rates. Yet with many asset prices underpinned by rock-bottom rates, investors have been jumpy, fretting that high inflation could force the central bank’s hand.</p><p>Then came a big inflation surprise. Figures published on May 12th showed that America’s consumer-price index rose by 4.2% year-on-year in April, a rate not seen since 2008, and considerably higher than the 3.6% that had been expected by forecasters. The s&amp;p 500, America’s main stockmarket index, fell by 2% that day.</p><p>By far the biggest factor behind the acceleration relates to the past, rather than the price pressures of today, as last year’s oil-price falls depressed the base used to calculate the annual rate. Yet even the monthly increase, stripped of more volatile food and energy prices, was 0.9%, the strongest since the 1980s. Data for a single month cannot tell you whether runaway inflation is around the corner. But the release says something about the realities of economic reopening.</p><p>Consumer demand in the world’s largest economy is roaring back. Stimulus cheques worth up to $1,400 were doled out to many Americans earlier in the year. Now a successful vaccination campaign is allowing them to get out and spend and restrictions to loosen. According to a tracker compiled by JPMorgan Chase, a bank, credit-card spending rose from a tenth below its pre-pandemic trend in the six months to March to only just below it by May.</p><p>The speed and nature of the post-lockdown bounceback seems to have caught many firms off guard. Not since the mid-1970s have companies been so likely to report delays in supplier deliveries, according to research published in March by Goldman Sachs, a bank. American retailers’ inventories, relative to revenues, have plunged to all-time lows, suggesting that shops are running out of things to sell. Many firms, especially smaller ones, had ordered insufficient supplies and are now frantically catching up. (By contrast, the inventories of large listed firms have not declined, either because they were better able to forecast the coming spending binge, or because their supply chains are more diversified.)</p><p>Yet surges in demand cannot immediately be fulfilled. Take imported supplies, for instance. Even at the best of times extra demand for international deliveries takes a while to sate; a ship can take a few weeks to sail from China to America. The added complication in 2021 is that firms must also contend with shortages of containers in some ports. Some were stuck in the wrong place during the first wave of lockdowns.</p><p>Moreover, workers cannot be hired overnight. Firms are struggling to recruit enough staff to fill open positions—perhaps a big reason why the jobs report for April, published on May 7th, showed that America had added just 266,000 jobs, well below the 1m or so that many economists had expected. The number of unfilled positions is running at an all-time high.</p><p>Take the surge in demand and strained supply together, and you get to higher prices. Used cars and trucks are a good example. Their prices rose by a staggering 10% in April, contributing to the headline-inflation surprise. With people nervous of flying and public transport, more may want to get behind the wheel instead to see relatives in other parts of the country, or to get to work. But a global shortage of computer chips has also constrained the supply of new vehicles.</p><p>Assured of sustained demand, other companies may also begin to pass on higher costs to customers. The cost of shipping items from China to America is now three times as expensive as it was before the pandemic, and input prices have picked up in the spring.</p><p>What, if anything, can these pressures tell you about inflation to come? In order for it to stay high, such price rises will need to keep repeating, pushing up wages in turn. But the present phase could reasonably be regarded as temporary, as suppliers adjust to shifting consumer tastes. Even as economies locked down in 2020, for instance, firms quickly found new ways to source material and bottlenecks eased. The current spike would then prove transitory.</p><p>Yet as the recovery proceeds, other surprises will come. The combination of a generous Treasury, a tolerant Fed and a reopening economy puts America in uncharted territory. Brace yourself for more inflation scares in the coming months. </p><p><a id="the-bull-case-for-beaten-up-britain"></a></p><h1 id="The-bull-case-for-beaten-up-Britain"><a href="#The-bull-case-for-beaten-up-Britain" class="headerlink" title="The bull case for beaten-up Britain"></a>The bull case for beaten-up Britain</h1><p>The immediate outlook is rosy; structural problems might even be fixed</p><p>One of the vices of Britons is a penchant for mourning the country’s decline. To be cured of this, Britain would probably need a different history. It was the first industrial nation. From that starting-point, its influence could only ever go in one direction: downwards. There is a large literature blaming long-term decline on sloth, complacency and amateurism. Brexit is just another opportunity to lament lost relevance.</p><p>This sense of decline is felt keenly in capital markets. Sterling was once the global currency but it now accounts for less than 5% of foreign-exchange reserves. Britain’s money markets used to stand out in Europe for their high interest rates; but no longer. And Britain’s stockmarket is a shadow of its former self. Big ipos are as rare as rocking-horse dung. This scarcity along with years of share underperformance has seen Britain’s share of global market capitalisation shrink markedly (see chart).</p><p>So accepted has the narrative of decline become, that it is probably time to bet the other way. The economy is poised for a sharp recovery. London’s bourse is stuffed with the shares of companies—miners, banks and energy firms—that ought to do well in an environment of rising inflation. And though fixing the structural deficiencies of Britain’s capital markets is a big task, it is not impossible.</p><p>On cyclical grounds, there is a strong case for Britain. The immediate outlook for the economy is rosier than almost anywhere. That in part reflects the ground lost to covid-19. The Bank of England reckons that, even after a surge in activity this quarter, gdp will still be around 5% below its pre-pandemic level. But it is also because the vaccine roll-out has been impressively quick. There is a sense, too, that uncertainty is diminishing. Brexit is done. The world has kept turning. And politics is more stable. Even if a fight over Scottish, and possibly Northern Irish, independence still looms, the ruling Conservatives enjoy a handsome majority in parliament.</p><p>The ftse All-Share index is heavy with the kind of cyclical stocks that have been in favour recently. But, lamentably, it is light on the digital champions of tomorrow. This is not for lack of innovation. Britain is rather good at fostering startups. There are various tax breaks to help fledgling companies raise seed capital. Universities have grasped that business spin-offs are to be encouraged, says Anne Glover of Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture-capital firm. Britain has four in the top ranks: Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and University College, London.</p><p>The country still attracts more venture capital than any other in Europe. London is an asset in this regard. If your ambition is to build a globally relevant technology company, it helps to start it in a global city. Berlin is cool and cheap, but lacks a world-class university. Paris is pretty, but French labour laws are a pain. London can be an easier place for the footloose entrepreneur to settle—though a lot rests on how post-Brexit visa schemes work.</p><p>Where Britain has fallen down is in turning fledgling companies into listed world-beaters. Promising startups reach a certain stage of maturity only to hit a brick wall in terms of funding. They are still too small to be listed, so need private funds to grow. But by and large the bigger cheques are written by American venture-capital firms. Once the board is packed with Americans, it is natural for them to seek an American exit from their investment—either a sale to a bigger company or a listing on the Nasdaq. Many British entrepreneurs are resigned to selling to a foreign buyer.</p><p>A recent government-backed review, led by Ron Kalifa, a fintech entrepreneur, proposes a series of reforms to encourage British listings. They include changing London’s listing rules to allow for dual classes of shares and smaller free-floats of stock—terms that are offered by New York and Hong Kong. There is also a proposal for a specialist growth-capital fund for pre-ipo businesses, backed by British asset managers. The goal is to turn a vicious cycle into a virtuous one, says Ms Glover. The more tech firms list in Britain, the more local analysts and asset managers will take an interest in them, encouraging further listings.</p><p>When Britain says it is “open for business”, it is taken to mean that its most promising firms are available to be gobbled up by foreign bidders. If there were local alternatives to such deals, its public markets might begin to look more attractive. Decline might even be reversed. In any event, though, the gloom has gone far enough. The case against sterling assets is oversold.</p><p><a id="china%E2%80%99s-census-shows-its-population-is-nearing-its-peak"></a></p><h1 id="China’s-census-shows-its-population-is-nearing-its-peak"><a href="#China’s-census-shows-its-population-is-nearing-its-peak" class="headerlink" title="China’s census shows its population is nearing its peak"></a>China’s census shows its population is nearing its peak</h1><p>It is also more urban and better educated</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Rarely does a census attract attention and controversy—unless the country counting its people is both the world’s largest and on the brink of decline, and its statisticians are notorious for fiddling their figures. So the results of China’s seventh census, conducted last year and released on May 11th, were big news. According to the data, the population reached 1.41bn last year, up by 5.4% from a decade ago. That ran contrary to a report last month in the Financial Times saying that China’s population fell below 1.4bn, which would have marked the first decline in six decades.</p><p>Adding to the intrigue around the census was its delay. The National Bureau of Statistics had originally promised to publish the figures in the first half of April. As ever with Chinese data, there were some oddities. Taken at face value, the population increase in 2020 when compared with annual birth figures suggested that, miraculously, no one died last year.</p><p>For those willing to grant Chinese officials a modicum of trust, the controversies can be explained away. It is misleading to compare China’s annually reported population figures, extrapolations based on tiny samples, with its once-a-decade census, in which boffins try to tot up everyone in the country. Demographers said the covid-19 pandemic, during which tens of millions of migrant workers returned to their rural homes, caused delays to the count. And upward revisions to past population data help resolve the death-free miracle (millions did in fact pass away last year).</p><p>Beyond the controversies, the census shone a light on the demographic trends reshaping China. For a start, the country is ageing rapidly. The number of people aged 60 and older hit 264m last year, up by more than 80m over the past decade, as China added roughly a Germany’s-worth of old folk. Longer lifespans are a marker of development success.</p><p>More worrying, though, is the plunge in fertility. Births last year fell to 12m, down by nearly 20% from 2019. When China ended its one-child policy in 2015, the government expected a baby boom. Instead, soaring housing and education costs and other realities of modern life led more women to choose not to marry. China’s fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman is about the same as Japan’s, and well below the 2.1 needed to keep a population stable. If China’s officials are to be believed, its population is still growing but will peak in the next few years—nearly a decade earlier than some government advisers had expected.</p><p>Rapid ageing will change the state’s role in society and add to fiscal pressures. For decades, benefiting from a bulge of young workers, officials could focus their spending on infrastructure. Now they will have to spend more on health and social care, and threadbare pension plans. All this raises questions about whether China will grow old before it grows rich.</p><p>But the census also showed how demographic changes are making China a more potent economic force. In 2020 it was home to 218m university graduates, nearly double the number in 2010. Even if the working-age population is declining, the dramatic increase in skills makes for a more formidable workforce. Moreover, migration from farms to cities, long a driver of economic growth, has continued. Nearly 64% of the population lived in urban areas last year, up from less than 50% in 2010.</p><p>As people move in search of opportunities, they are redrawing China’s map. The rust-belt provinces in the north-east lost millions of younger residents over the past decade, while prosperous coastal areas, notably Guangdong and Zhejiang, gained millions. As a whole, China is getting older, more educated and more urban. But that change is not evenly spread. The outside world is understandably focused on the question of when China’s population will peak. Within China, the widening gap between haves and have-nots is just as pressing a concern. </p><p><a id="david-swensen-an-influential-investor-died-on-may-5th"></a></p><h1 id="David-Swensen-an-influential-investor-died-on-May-5th"><a href="#David-Swensen-an-influential-investor-died-on-May-5th" class="headerlink" title="David Swensen, an influential investor, died on May 5th"></a>David Swensen, an influential investor, died on May 5th</h1><p>At Yale, Mr Swensen perfected the modern endowment model</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Starting in the 1980s, the endowments of a handful of big American universities began to divert their investments away from publicly traded equities and bonds towards “alternative” assets, such as venture capital and private equity. David Swensen, who died on May 5th aged 67, perfected the approach. Referred to variously as the endowment, Yale or Swensen model, it has since been copied—by family offices, sovereign-wealth funds and, more recently, by big pension funds.</p><p>In 1985 Mr Swensen was persuaded by James Tobin, a Nobel-prizewinning Yale economist, to give up a lucrative career on Wall Street to return to his former university to run its investment office. Yale’s endowment was then worth around $1bn. By the middle of last year the figure had risen to $31bn. Even this astonishing growth understates Mr Swensen’s influence. He was responsible for developing a stream of talented asset managers at Yale. And in two best-selling books, he set down his investment philosophy for a wider audience.</p><p>Three pillars of this thinking stand out. The first concerns time horizon. Because endowments have obligations stretching far into the future, they can take a long-term view. They can sacrifice the ease of trading in public markets for the better returns promised in private equity. By doing so, they can earn an illiquidity premium—a reward for giving up the ability to sell out easily.</p><p>The second pillar concerns information. It is hard to find mispriced stocks in the public markets, because news about listed companies travels fast and is quickly incorporated into prices. But investors in private markets who do their homework are more likely to be rewarded. That is because reliable data and analysis are much harder to come by.</p><p>The third pillar is the importance of a contrarian mindset. Mr Swensen had a chance early on to demonstrate his. Following the stockmarket crash in October 1987, he had loaded up on company shares, which had become much cheaper, by selling bonds, which had risen in price. This rebalancing was in line with the fund’s agreed policy. But set against the prevailing market gloom, it looked rash. His investment committee was worried. One member warned that there would be “hell to pay” if Yale got it wrong. But Mr Swensen stuck to his guns. The decision stood—and paid off handsomely.</p><p>These days, the Swensen model is often reduced to an asset-allocation decision: hold alternatives. But as money has flooded into private-equity funds, average returns have converged on the returns in public markets. There is no longer an obvious illiquidity premium. But Mr Swensen’s point about information remains relevant. The dispersion of returns—the gap between the best and worst funds—is far higher in private than in public equity. Selecting the right private-equity manager takes expertise. Yale has some advantages: it can, say, tap into its alumni network for access to the better-run funds.</p><p>Mr Swensen is given too much credit in one regard. Endowments had a history of innovation before his return to Yale. Harvard’s was already changing. And endowments had previously been pioneers in asset allocation: the Ivy League funds shifted markedly from bonds into equities from the 1930s. In other respects Mr Swensen gets too little credit. Star investors are generally not good at mentoring others.

Joe Biden wants to help overhaul it</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>For years governments have grumbled, simmered and raged as multinational companies have shifted profits out of tax collectors’ grasp and into low-tax havens. The oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, estimated in 2015 that avoidance robs public coffers of $100bn-240bn, or 4-10% of global corporation-tax revenues a year. Now the fiscal fallout from covid-19 is adding urgency to governments’ efforts to claw some money back—most notably in America, where President Joe Biden plans to raise taxes on corporate profits, including foreign income.</p><p>Mr Biden’s proposals will grind their way through Congress. Finance ministers from the g7 group of countries are likely to discuss global tax reform when they meet in London on June 4th-5th. And later in the summer 139 countries will discuss changing the system for taxing multinational companies. The confluence of a political shift in America and a global push to raise more tax revenue to pay for the pandemic means a degree of optimism is in the air. The proposals under discussion may initially raise only a modest amount of revenue, but they still represent a big break with the past.</p><p>The foundations of the global corporate-tax system were laid a century ago. It recognises that overlapping taxes on the same slice of profits can curb trade and growth. As a result, taxing rights are allocated first to wherever profits are produced (the “source”) and then to wherever the parent company is headquartered (or “resident”). A multinational based in America but with an affiliate in Ireland, for example, typically pays taxes in both places. Where the company makes its sales is irrelevant. Payments between an individual firm’s various legal affiliates are recorded using the “arm’s-length” principle, supposedly on terms equivalent to those found on the open market.</p><p>These principles, now baked into thousands of bilateral tax treaties, have had two unintended consequences. First, they have encouraged governments to compete for investment and revenue by offering tantalisingly low tax rates (see chart 1). In 1985 the global average statutory corporation-tax rate was 49%; in 2018 it was 24%. Ireland boasts a statutory rate of just 12.5%; Bermuda, 0%. Second, tax competition has encouraged companies to shuffle their reported profits to low-tax places. In 2016 around $1trn of global profits were booked in so-called “investment hubs”. These include the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Singapore, which apply an average effective tax rate of 5% on the profits of non-resident companies.</p><p>There is a huge mismatch between where tax is paid and where real activity takes place. Analysis by the oecd suggests that multinationals report 25% of their profits in investment hubs, although only 11% of their tangible assets and less than 5% of their workers are based there. Parents can allocate paper profits to affiliates in tax havens by having them hold intellectual property that is then licensed to other affiliates in high-tax places. The problem seems to have worsened over time, perhaps because more firms make money from intangible services, from software to streaming videos. The share of American multinationals’ foreign profits booked in tax havens has risen from 30% two decades ago to about 60% today. Most investors and bosses view firms’ tax bills as a black box that only a few lawyers and tax experts truly understand.</p><p>One way of capturing the scale of manipulation is to examine what would happen if there were a single common tax rate. A recent study by Thomas Torslov of Kraka, a Danish think-tank, and Ludvig Wier and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, tried to quantify this. A staggering $670bn in paper profits, which are unconnected to things like factories, would have moved in 2016—almost 40% of multinationals’ foreign earnings. Big Western countries are losers from the current system: profits in America and France, for instance, are depressed by around a fifth (see chart 2). By comparison, havens collect more revenue, as a share of gdp, despite their rock-bottom effective rates. Hong Kong collects a third of its corporate-tax receipts by attracting profits from high-tax countries; Ireland, over half.</p><p>The rise of Silicon Valley has added fuel to the fire. Some governments gripe at giant firms serving customers without any physical presence in their country and while paying no tax. The problems posed by the tech firms are not in fact new: pharmaceutical companies have long held mobile and hard-to-value intellectual property; exporters do not incur tax liabilities where they sell. Still, digital services have become a target. More than 40 governments, from France to India, are either levying or planning to levy digital-services taxes on the revenue of firms such as Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>The growing sense of anarchy over how to tax Silicon Valley, the global desire to raise more tax revenues and a more conciliatory White House all mean the scene is set for a global deal. The oecd’s forthcoming summit is not the first time it has tried to orchestrate reforms—it helped pass changes to the transfer-pricing regime in 2015. But this time two more ambitious proposals are under discussion.</p><p>The first would reallocate taxing rights so that a slice of profits could be levied according to, say, the location of a company’s sales. That right could be incurred even if the company had no physical presence in the country. Mr Biden’s negotiators have proposed a reallocation that would apply to the 100 biggest and most profitable companies worldwide; in return, the Biden administration wants all the digital-services taxes to be dropped. The second element would apply a minimum rate of corporation tax, putting a floor on the race to the bottom. The Biden administration is gunning for a global minimum tax rate on foreign earnings of 21%, applied to profits within each jurisdiction separately.</p><p>You say you want a revolution<br>Could these ideas form the basis for an eventual deal? The proposal for profit reallocation has been broadly welcomed by other big rich economies. Yet there is still plenty of scope for disagreement on the details. Assessing the location of sales made by one business to another, if it then goes on to make sales in a different country, is tricky. Some governments also still want to turn the screws on Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and the like: the European Union seems to be preparing to go ahead with a digital levy regardless of the outcome at the oecd. That in turn could cause some American lawmakers to eschew global co-operation. Meanwhile, many tax havens may resist higher minimum tax rates that eliminate the advantage for companies of booking profits there.</p><p>As a result any deal will involve compromises. The amount of profit that is reallocated in order to resemble economic reality more closely could be capped. For example, the oecd’s blueprint does take the radical step of considering companies as a whole, rather than separated into affiliates. Still, most profits would remain taxed as they are. The right to tax, say, 20% of profits above a routine rate of 10% of revenues would be reallocated according to a formula that could be based on sales. Meanwhile America’s preferred minimum rate of 21% is unlikely to be agreed on more widely, as countries sniff about tax sovereignty. A rate of 10-15% is much more realistic.</p><p>How much difference would changes of this magnitude make? The reallocation plan, as it stands, aims to raise a puny $5bn-12bn in annual revenues. The oecd reckons that a minimum rate of 12.5% would raise $23bn-42bn directly through the higher rate, and another $19bn-28bn by reducing profit-shifting. These figures are not particularly impressive, although they might let governments crank up domestic tax rates without worrying as much about the danger of capital flight.</p><p>Still, an agreement on new principles could leave the door open to bolder changes later. Carlos Protto, one of Argentina’s representatives in theoecd talks, says that focusing only on the biggest multinationals helps build consensus now, but also notes that many countries expect the scope of any reforms to be broadened eventually.</p><p>What if countries cannot agree? America will forge ahead with reforms to its domestic taxes, including provisions that could unilaterally increase the tax load of American subsidiaries of foreign companies that pay skimpy tax bills globally. Meanwhile digital-services taxes could spread like wildfire—potentially incurring American tariffs in retaliation. On May 10th the United States Trade Representative held a fourth day of hearings on retaliating against foreign digital-services taxes. Overhaul or not, tax bills will rise. </p><p><a id="who-bears-the-burden-of-a-corporate-tax"></a></p><h1 id="Who-bears-the-burden-of-a-corporate-tax"><a href="#Who-bears-the-burden-of-a-corporate-tax" class="headerlink" title="Who bears the burden of a corporate tax?"></a>Who bears the burden of a corporate tax?</h1><p>Though aimed at shareholders, some of the costs fall on workers</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Joe biden wants to rebuild America, and he reckons that American firms can help foot the bill. Central to the president’s grand infrastructure-investment push is a plan to raise the tax rate on corporate income from 21% to 28% (though he has hinted he may settle for less). Although the administration pitches its tax proposals as a way to redress the problem that “those at the top are not doing their part”, opponents warn that corporate-tax rises do not simply fall on wealthy shareholders, but also shrink the pay packets of the working people the president claims to champion. In fact, workers often do bear some of the burden of increases in corporate taxes—though understanding just how much is a question that continues to vex economists. Nonetheless, the details of Mr Biden’s tax plans suggest that they may prove more worker-friendly than the usual effort to squeeze juice from Apple.</p><p>Other things being equal, a tax on corporate profits should hit shareholders—a group wealthier than the population as a whole—by shrinking the money available for dividend payments or reducing share values. But other things are never equal. Firms invariably respond to new taxes in order to minimise their costs. Depending on precisely how they seek to escape the tax, some of its burden may be passed on to others. A seminal paper published in 1962 by Arnold Harberger, an economist, reckoned that such wriggling by owners of capital was unlikely to shift the cost of a corporate tax onto other inputs to production. He imagined an economy with just two sectors, corporate and non-corporate, and then supposed that a tax was placed on the income of the former. Capital, he reasoned, should shift from the corporate sector to the non-corporate (consisting of partnerships and other sorts of business). As a consequence, the average rate of return on capital in non-corporate firms should fall, reflecting the flow of resources to lower-yielding sorts of production made attractive only because of the sector’s comparatively favourable tax status. Corporations could shift some of the burden of corporate tax to owners of capital in other parts of the economy, but not pass it on to workers.</p><p>Mr Harberger’s model made a number of simplifying assumptions, however. He assumed, for instance, that markets were perfectly competitive. In practice, firms may enjoy market power over either workers (in which case some of the cost of the tax may be absorbed by wages rather than just profits) or consumers (who may face higher prices). Perhaps most important, Mr Harberger assumed that the economy in question was closed. In practice, capital is relatively mobile across national borders—and intangible forms, like intellectual property, extremely so—while other factors of production like labour are not. Increasing corporate tax in one country might then encourage owners of capital to move activity abroad, diminishing the amount of capital per worker at home, and potentially reducing workers’ productivity and pay. Indeed, research by Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University and Lawrence Summers of Harvard University showed that in very small, very open economies the burden of a rise in corporate-income tax could fall almost entirely on labour.</p><p>The size of an economy and its openness to capital flows are just two of the five factors that most influence an economic model’s conclusions regarding the incidence of corporate-tax changes, argued Jennifer Gravelle Stratton, then of the Congressional Budget Office, in a paper published in 2013. (Size matters because changes in the capital stock of larger economies have a greater influence on the worldwide return on capital.) Another factor is how seamlessly production may be moved abroad in response to tax changes. Similarly, the ease with which labour may be substituted for capital determines how badly workers’ economic prospects are affected when capital flees the country (or threatens to). Last, who pays most depends critically on how capital-intensive the corporate sector is: the greater the level of capital per worker, the more each worker suffers if a corporate-tax rise affects where firms choose to deploy their capital.</p><p>Sorting out the likely effects of a corporate-tax change, in other words, is complicated and messy. Empirical studies demonstrate exactly that. A paper published in 2015 by Kevin Hassett, later a chairman of President Donald Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, concluded that a 1% rise in the corporate-tax rate is associated with a 0.5% drop in wages: a result that implies that more than 100% of the burden of corporate tax lands on workers. At the other end of the scale, a study of economies in the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, by Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College who is now a deputy assistant secretary at America’s Treasury Department, found no clear relationship between corporate tax and wages.</p><p>Passing the buck<br>Other studies suggest the burden is shared. An analysis of the German economy published in 2017, which used variations in local business-tax rates to assess how their costs were distributed, concluded that more than half the burden is borne by workers. Economists who summarise the literature often note that labour bears some but not all of the burden of corporate tax—perhaps about 40%—while occasionally allowing that the true figure depends heavily on the context of a given tax measure.</p><p>Context, however, is subject to change. Reducing differences in corporate-tax rates across countries gives companies less scope to pass the tax burden on to workers by shifting production abroad. The Biden administration’s proposal for a global minimum rate is in large part targeted at firms that use accounting tricks to book profits in tax havens. Yet it should also deter governments’ efforts to lure production by undercutting other countries’ tax rates. That would ensure that more of the burden of corporate tax falls where it is meant to.</p><p><a id="science--technology---old-electric-cars-are-a-raw-material-of-the-future"></a></p><h1 id="Science-amp-technology-—Old-electric-cars-are-a-raw-material-of-the-future"><a href="#Science-amp-technology-—Old-electric-cars-are-a-raw-material-of-the-future" class="headerlink" title="(Science &amp; technology)—Old electric cars are a raw material of the future"></a>(Science &amp; technology)—Old electric cars are a raw material of the future</h1><p>But they need to be designed to make recycling them easier</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Car sales have, generally speaking, plunged during the coronavirus epidemic. But there has been one bright spot. Electric vehicles (evs) continue to grow in popularity. According to ihs Markit, a research firm, almost 2.5m battery-electric and plug-in-hybrid cars were sold around the world in 2020—and the company expects that number to grow by 70% this year. Bloombergnef, another researcher, reckons that by 2030 some 8% of the 1.4bn cars on the road will be electric, rising to more than 30% by 2040. It is not, moreover, just a matter of cars. There will also be electric lorries, buses, motorbikes, bicycles, scooters, ships and maybe even aircraft. And, when all of these machines come to the ends of their useful lives, they will need to be recycled.</p><p>This coming avalanche of e-waste will be hard to deal with. When a petrol or diesel car is dismantled and crushed, as much as 95% of it is likely to be used again. Ways to do that are well-developed, straightforward and helped by the fact that, on average, almost 70% of such a vehicle consists of readily recyclable ferrous metals. evs, by contrast, contain a far greater variety of materials (see chart). Separating and sorting these is tricky, especially as many of them are locked up inside complex electrical components.</p><p>Flat batteries<br>For those who can manage to do so, though, there is good business to be had here. evs contain lots of valuable stuff. The magnets in their motors are full of rare-earth metals, and their batteries of lithium and cobalt. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian research company, forecasts that as the number of electric vehicles being made rises, lithium prices will triple by the end of the decade. Cobalt, meanwhile, comes mainly from Congo, a country that is often war-torn and has a dreadful human-rights record.</p><p>Generally speaking, electrical waste is shredded in bulk before it is sorted and reprocessed. But lithium-ion batteries, the type used in evs, are inflammable, so need careful handling. They are shredded separately in special machines filled with liquids or gases that suppress combustion. The result, called “black mass”, is then processed to extract its valuable components.</p><p>There are two ways of doing so. The more common at the moment is pyrometallurgy. This treats black mass as an ore, by smelting it in a furnace to liberate a metallic mixture from which pure metals, particularly the cobalt, can be separated. That, though, requires a lot of energy. It also destroys valuable non-metallic components such as the graphite in batteries’ anodes. And it fails to liberate the lithium, which ends up in compounds in the slag that is generated alongside the liquid metal, and must then be extracted separately.</p><p>The other approach, hydrometallurgy, works more subtly. It leaches metals, lithium included, out of the shredded material by dissolving them in acids or other solvents. That requires less energy and also permits the recovery of non-metallic materials such as graphite. Hydrometallurgy is more complex than pyrometallurgy, and comes with the added expense of treating the waste water it generates, to prevent pollution. But its overall advantages suggest it is the wave of the future.</p><p>Li-Cycle, a Canadian company founded in 2016 that is already the biggest recycler of lithium-ion batteries in North America, is one outfit betting on hydrometallurgy. To improve the gathering of its raw material Li-Cycle is testing what it calls spoke-and-hub systems. These collect incoming batteries of all sorts, not just those from evs, at geographically dispersed receiving stations (the spokes), shred them, and then sort the debris, using automatic separation and sieving systems, into three types of mixture: plastic, copper and aluminium, and black mass. The plastic and the copper-aluminium mix are sold to other recyclers. The black mass is sent to the system’s hub, a hydrometallurgical processing plant that serves many spokes.</p><p>Kunal Phalpher, Li-Cycle’s chief commercial officer, says experience with a demonstration hub at the firm’s base in Kingston, Ontario, suggests this approach can recover cobalt, lithium and also nickel (an important ingredient of some non-lithium-ion batteries) in a form pure enough for those metals to be used directly to make new batteries. In all, Mr Phalpher claims, the process recycles 95% of a battery’s materials. Li-Cycle will soon complete its first properly commercial hub, in Rochester, New York, and has plans for three more around the world by 2025.</p><p>Li-Cycle is not alone, though, in its hydrometallurgical ambitions. One rival is Redwood Materials of Carson City, Nevada, which was founded in 2017 by Jeffrey Straubel, formerly chief technology officer of Tesla, a big maker of evs. Redwood uses a combination of pyro- and hydrometallurgy in its process, with some of the recovered materials providing energy to drive the pyro side of the equation. It already recycles rejects from the American ev-battery factories of two Japanese firms, Panasonic and Nissan, and is now setting up an operation that will take used batteries from general consumer goods.</p><p>Northvolt, another firm started by ex-Tesla-ites (Peter Carlsson, its chief executive, and Paolo Cerruti, its chief operating officer), makes lithium-ion batteries for European carmakers. It is adding a recycling plant to its factory in Sweden, to process the batteries it produces there when they reach the ends of their lives. Their steel and plastic casings, and copper wiring, are removed manually before they are crushed in an inert environment. Nickel, manganese, cobalt and lithium are then removed by hydrometallurgy. Northvolt has also formed a partnership with Hydro, a Norwegian aluminium producer, to recover that metal as well. The firm hopes that, by 2030, half the materials it uses to make new batteries will have been recycled.</p><p>Similar “closed-loop” systems are being developed in other parts of the battery supply chain. For example, American Battery Technology, a firm in Nevada that mines and processes lithium, is adding a recycling plant intended to recover lithium and other metals from expired batteries. It will use the lithium in its own production processes and sell the other materials on.</p><p>The biggest battery-recycling operations of all, though, are not Western, but Chinese—not surprising, perhaps, given that China is the world’s largest market for evs, and the country’s government has been promoting the recycling of lithium-ion batteries for some time. Brunp Reycling, a subsidiary of catl, the world’s biggest ev-battery-maker, has half-a-dozen hydrometallurgical recycling operations around the country. Brunp says it can recycle 120,000 tonnes of old batteries a year, which it claims represents about half of China’s current annual battery-recycling capacity. Meanwhile, American Battery Technology’s approach of integrating recycling with primary production of lithium echoes that of Gangfeng Lithium, one of the world’s largest producers of lithium for batteries. Gangfeng, which has already installed a heavily automated recycling plant at its base in Jiangxi province, plans to build another as part of its mining operation in Sonora state, in Mexico.</p><p>Tesla itself also has trans-Pacific ambitions. It is setting up a battery-recycling facility at its ev factory in Shanghai, to complement one it is developing at its battery factory in Nevada. Nor is Tesla the only vehicle-maker involving itself in the industry. In January, Volkswagen opened a pilot battery-recycling plant in Salzgitter, near Hanover, to recover materials from batteries used in evs made by its various brands.</p><p>Salzgitter is close to the company’s battery factory in Braunschweig, which is being expanded to produce more than 600,000 ev battery packs a year. The idea, says Frank Blome, head of batteries for Volkswagen Group Components, is that the firm’s battery experts will work with its recyclers to make battery packs easier to dismantle. As Mr Blome observes, “anyone who takes something apart first needs to know how it was put together.”</p><p>Designing recyclability in from the beginning will, in the long run, be crucial to the effective recycling of electric vehicles—and especially their batteries. Shredding lots of different types of e-waste at the same time inevitably results in contamination. Separating components before doing so would yield greater levels of purity. Some components, such as cathodes, might even be reused in their entirety.</p><p>Deconstructing reality<br>Easing disassembly is also an important goal for Volkswagen’s domestic rival, bmw. According to Frank Weber, a member of the firm’s board, bmw will, from the start, be designing its electric vehicles with mass recycling in mind. This will include the handling of the solid-state lithium-ion batteries which bmw hopes to make in volume by the end of the decade. Solid-state batteries, which are able to store more charge than those using existing gel-based electrolytes, could double the range of evs. They will also be safer to use for, unlike those containing gel electrolytes, they will not be inflammable.</p><p>While gel electrolytes continue to persist, however, it would be best if they too could be recycled. In the case of the most common of them, lithium hexafluorophosphate (known as pf6), that does not yet happen. Instead, this valuable chemical is destroyed during processing and has to be resynthesised from any lithium recovered. But a team led by Anand Bhatt and Thomas Ruether at csiro, Australia’s national science organisation, think they have come up with a way to recover pf6 intact. They use a special solvent to extract it from black mass before any further metallurgical process is applied to it. The pf6 obtained in this way is, they say, good enough to be used to make new batteries without further processing.</p><p>Also in Australia, a firm called EcoGraf has developed a process that can extract graphite from black mass with a purity that allows it be reused for making anodes. SungEel HiTech, a scrap-merchant that is South Korea’s biggest battery recycler, is now setting up a plant at its factory in Gusan to do just that.</p><p>Scrap merchants have to be flexible. SungEel’s previous main business was recycling plasma-television screens, which have, these days, largely, been superseded by led versions. Plasma televisions turned out to be a passing fad. evs, though, are likely to run and run. </p><p><a id="a-way-to-recover-rare-earths-from-electric-motors%E2%80%99-magnets"></a></p><h1 id="A-way-to-recover-rare-earths-from-electric-motors’-magnets"><a href="#A-way-to-recover-rare-earths-from-electric-motors’-magnets" class="headerlink" title="A way to recover rare earths from electric motors’ magnets"></a>A way to recover rare earths from electric motors’ magnets</h1><p>First, you react them with hydrogen</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The motors driving today’s electric cars use powerful magnets made from rare-earth metals. Not all rare earths are actually that rare. Neodymium, for instance, is about as abundant as tin. But good, workable deposits are scarce, and many are in China, which has, in the past, imposed export quotas. This, combined with an absence of substitutes, make rare earths pricey enough to constitute more than half of such a motor’s cost. Yet virtually none is recycled—a deficiency that extends also to the motors in computer hard drives, cordless tools and domestic appliances, and to the generators (essentially, electric motors in reverse) in wind turbines.</p><p>The problem, says Allan Walton, who leads the Magnetic Materials Group at the University of Birmingham, in Britain, is that the process of shredding and separating usually applied to electronic waste makes the recovery of rare earths hard. Rare-earth magnets are brittle, and break into particles which oxidise readily in air. The result is a residue which is of little, if any, commercial value.</p><p>Dr Walton and his colleagues hope to change this, using a process developed by Rex Harris, now an emeritus professor at Birmingham, to recycle neodymium, the rare earth most widely employed in electric motors. In Dr Harris’s process, components containing neodymium-based magnets destined for recycling are tipped into a vessel that is then pumped full of hydrogen. A reaction between the hydrogen and the neodymium causes the material of the magnets to expand until it shatters. The result is a demagnetised powder. Once the vessel’s contents have been tumbled and sieved, and the hydrogen removed, the extracted powder is of a quality good enough for it to be processed straight back into magnets.</p><p>To recycle neodymium in this way, Dr Walton and his team have set up a firm called Hypromag. They say the resulting magnets need 88% less energy to make than equivalents produced from scratch. To help commercialise the process, Hypromag has teamed up with Bentley, a British subsidiary of Volkswagen well known for its luxury cars, which is now developing a range of electric models. Even petrol-driven Bentleys, however, contain lots of electric motors. Some operate features found routinely in other vehicles—power steering, self-winding windows and the multiple loudspeakers in the audio system. Less common in other marques are the motors that pamper the occupants by massaging their backs through the seat covers. All of these, though, will eventually be grist to Dr Walton’s mill.</p><p><a id="doubts-are-growing-about-therapy-for-gender-dysphoric-children"></a></p><h1 id="Doubts-are-growing-about-therapy-for-gender-dysphoric-children"><a href="#Doubts-are-growing-about-therapy-for-gender-dysphoric-children" class="headerlink" title="Doubts are growing about therapy for gender-dysphoric children"></a>Doubts are growing about therapy for gender-dysphoric children</h1><p>Drug treatments seem to do little good, and may be harmful</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Gender medicine was once an obscure specialty. Patients with gender dysphoria were typically middle-aged men wishing to live as women. Things are different now. First, there are many more patients. Referrals to a specialist clinic attached to the Free University of Amsterdam rose 20-fold between 1980 and 2015. The Gender Identity Development Service (gids) at the Tavistock Clinic in London, England and Wales’s only paediatric gender clinic, sees 30 times more people than a decade ago. The patients have changed, too. Most are now female and in their teens. Many are treated with drugs to block the onset of puberty. These are often followed by hormones to promote development of physical characteristics of the opposite sex, as part of an approach called affirmation therapy.</p><p>Last June, though, Finland revised its guidelines to prefer psychological treatment to drugs. In September Britain launched a top-down review of the field. In December the High Court of England and Wales ruled that under-16s were unlikely to be able to consent meaningfully to taking puberty blockers, leading gids to suspend new referrals, though a subsequent ruling held that parents could consent on their children’s behalf. On April 6th Arkansas passed laws that make prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children illegal. Also in April the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital in Stockholm, a part of the Karolinska Institute, announced that it would stop prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those under 18, except in clinical trials.</p><p>Those sceptical of affirmation therapy point out two problems. Evidence is lacking, and what exists is not reassuring. A review by Sweden’s health authorities in 2019 found little research, mostly of poor quality. Britain’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence found that puberty blockers did little to dispel gender dysphoria or improve patients’ mental health (though they do not make such feelings worse). Moreover, existing studies suggest that, without intervention, most children with gender dysphoria end up reconciled to their natal sex as adults.</p><p>There is also evidence that the drugs may cause serious harm. One example is described by Michael Biggs of Oxford University in a letter published on April 26th in the Journal of Paediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism. Bone-mineral density (bmd) usually rises sharply in puberty. But of 24 gids patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers, a third had bmd scores in the bottom 2% of their age groups (more that two standard deviations below the mean, see chart).</p><p>One patient, who began puberty blockers aged 12, suffered four fractures by the age of 16. That medical history, says Dr Biggs, would usually be enough to diagnose osteoporosis—normally a disease of the elderly. Animal studies suggest puberty blockers may cause cognitive damage, too. Cross-sex hormones have been linked to heart disease, strokes and sterility.</p><p>The combination of rising prescriptions and flimsy evidence leads some doctors to fear a medical scandal is brewing. Others think that the only scandal would be to change course. A bill before Canada’s parliament, for instance, would leave affirmation as the only legal treatment for gender dysphoria. The argument continues. </p><p><a id="scientists-prefer-studying-pretty-plants-to-dull-ones"></a></p><h1 id="Scientists-prefer-studying-pretty-plants-to-dull-ones"><a href="#Scientists-prefer-studying-pretty-plants-to-dull-ones" class="headerlink" title="Scientists prefer studying pretty plants to dull ones"></a>Scientists prefer studying pretty plants to dull ones</h1><p>Their interest is swayed most by flower colour</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Who was responsible for inventing the term “charismatic megafauna” is lost in the mists of time. The words do, though, describe a real phenomenon, which is that big, showy animals tend to get a disproportionate amount of attention from biologists. Whether this reflects the prejudices of the researchers themselves or is a consequence of a wider public interest in preserving showy species, and of the concomitant funding which accompanies that interest, is not clear. Probably a bit of both. But what is true for the animal kingdom is, it now turns out, true for the plant one as well, as Martino Adamo of the University of Turin, in Italy, describes this week in Nature Plants.</p><p>While conducting research in the mountains near Turin on Tephroseris balbisiana, a scruffy yellow-flowered ragwort (pictured), Dr Adamo noticed it was easier to track down information about other, more beautiful, species found in the region than it was to discover things about the object of his own research. That led him to wonder if the well-attested preferences of zoologists for the showy also extends to botanists. To find out, he recruited a team of fellow researchers to help him analyse the literature on the matter.</p><p>To keep the project within bounds, the team restricted their attention to Dr Adamo’s original area of investigation, the south-western Alps. Surveys suggest this is inhabited by 113 endemic plants—a number large enough to be statistically meaningful but small enough to be tractable.</p><p>First, the team compiled, for each of these species, a set of data that recorded three types of trait: ecological (preferred elevation, soil acidity, light levels and moisture); rarity (geographical-range size, and also conservation status as described by the International Union for Conservation of Nature); and aesthetic (flower colour, stem height and flower diameter). They then searched a database called the Web of Science for papers published since 1975 that included the names of any of the species in question.</p><p>They found 280 such papers, statistical analysis of which revealed that certain plants were not only more studied than others, but also shared particular traits more often than would be expected by chance. Foremost of these was flower colour. Plants with blue flowers, such as Gentiana ligustica, the trumpet gentian (also pictured), were heavily over-represented. White-flowered plants did well, too. And so did those which display their flowers prominently, on long stems.</p><p>The other cause of greater-than-expected scientific attention was a plant’s range size—the larger the better. That, presumably, is a consequence of ease of study. But in the matter of charisma it seems that, like the insects which flowers have evolved to attract, botanists are lured by the showy, and are therefore just as susceptible as their zoological colleagues to aesthetic bias in their choice of topic. </p><p><a id="a-new-fuel-for-jets-and-missiles-is-on-the-cards"></a></p><h1 id="A-new-fuel-for-jets-and-missiles-is-on-the-cards"><a href="#A-new-fuel-for-jets-and-missiles-is-on-the-cards" class="headerlink" title="A new fuel for jets and missiles is on the cards"></a>A new fuel for jets and missiles is on the cards</h1><p>Boron, a hitherto-neglected element, may have a military use</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The latest buzzword in the world’s aerospace skunk works is “hypersonic”. Speed and surprise have always been essential to warfare, and what better way to wrong-foot an enemy than by arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep in the form of an aircraft or missile travelling at Mach 5?</p><p>In that context, a notice posted at the beginning of the year by America’s navy, soliciting proposals for a new research project, is intriguing. The project’s objective is to “determine a form of boron or a boron-based chemical pathway that leads to implementation of boron in energetic compounds, especially fuels (solid and liquid)”. The navy’s engineers, it seems, are trying to revive an idea that might make hypersonic flight easier to achieve, but which was tested and then abandoned more than half a century ago. They hope to spice up aviation and rocket fuel with a long-neglected element.</p><p>Boron, atomic number five on the periodic table, is chemically a “metalloid”—meaning that it inhabits the debatable marcher lands between the empires of the metals proper, on the table’s left-hand side, and the non-metals, on its right. Compounds of boron feature in washing powders and cleaning products (“borax”), antiseptics and water softeners, and also as additives in fibreglass, but such roles are humdrum. Boron does, though, burn like billy-o, generating a bright, green flame and releasing about 40% more energy per kilogram than conventional aviation fuel.</p><p>In light of this, and of reports by spies of green flames emerging from the exhaust of an experimental Soviet rocket, America’s air force experimented in the 1950s with stuff nicknamed zip fuel, which was laced with compounds of boron called boranes. The project was abandoned in 1959, for two good reasons. First, boranes proved extremely dangerous. They are toxic, meaning those working with them need special gas masks. They also ignite spontaneously in air, and may even explode. At least eight people involved in the zip-fuel project died in borane-related accidents.</p><p>The second reason for zip fuel’s abandonment was that the stuff itself proved disappointing. In jets, instead of burning completely, it produced a sticky residue which clung to turbine blades. Boron additives in rocket fuels also failed. The combustion process involved proved unexpectedly complex, and the promised additional energy was not forthcoming.</p><p>The navy’s notice suggests, though, that boron is back. The boffins behind it think that new physical forms of the element, known as allotropes, may offer ways around both the partial-combustion and the toxicity problems. Allotropes of an element can have very different properties from each other (graphite and diamond, for example, are both allotropes of carbon). The organisers suggest a novel boron allotrope, perhaps interlaced at the molecular level with a suitable oxidising agent, might yield a completely combustible, non-toxic fuel, and they are asking the country’s chemists to bring them one.</p><p>Whether such allotropes exist remains to be seen. But America is not the only place working on the idea of boron-powered jets and rockets. China is interested, too. A project involving gelled fuel that has particles of boron suspended in it is under way at the National University of Defence Technology, in Changsha. The objective is to develop fuel for ramjets, a type of engine that operates efficiently only above Mach 3. So far, the researchers involved have managed to produce one that is 40% boron and yet burns more or less completely. One way or another, then, it looks plausible that boron-based fuels may get the green light. </p><p><a id="books--arts---for-stacey-abrams-politics-and-storytelling-overlap"></a></p><h1 id="Books-amp-arts-—For-Stacey-Abrams-politics-and-storytelling-overlap"><a href="#Books-amp-arts-—For-Stacey-Abrams-politics-and-storytelling-overlap" class="headerlink" title="(Books &amp; arts)—For Stacey Abrams, politics and storytelling overlap"></a>(Books &amp; arts)—For Stacey Abrams, politics and storytelling overlap</h1><p>The many lives of an activist and novelist have a unifying plot-line</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Stacey abrams wrote her first novel at 14. It was a soul-searching tale called “My Diary of Angst”. “I was very tortured as a teenager,” she recalls with a laugh. There is nothing tortured about Ms Abrams now. At 47, she is a champion of voting rights and a household name across America. She is widely credited with swinging the state of Georgia to the Democrats, helping to send Joe Biden to the White House and two Democratic newcomers—one black, one Jewish—to the Senate. Even among her admirers, few may have realised that, in her spare time, she was still writing novels.</p><p>The secret is out with the publication of “While Justice Sleeps”, a political thriller about a Supreme Court justice in a coma and his mixed-race clerk, Avery Keene, who must save both him and the world. It follows eight romance novels written under the pen-name Selena Montgomery, which Ms Abrams began at Yale Law School and continued in the early years of her career as a lawyer and legislator in Atlanta.</p><p>All these star young, brilliant African-American women, forced to confront their fears and overcome dastardly villains, with the requisite heaving bosoms—or, in this first thriller, and the first of Ms Abrams’s novels published under her real name, a single modest kiss. She started writing fiction because she wanted to see characters who looked like her achieving remarkable things, she says in an interview from her home in Atlanta. Making black lives visible—making them count, in every sense—is the overarching plot-line of both her literary and political endeavours.</p><p>“The more you see of possibility, the more you internalise that it could be true for you,” she explains. Imagining alternative realities is, she says, as much a part of public as literary life: “Politics is about creating the world you want to see.” It is a lesson Ms Abrams learned early from her parents, growing up among the “genteel poor” of Mississippi. “They wanted us to imagine that justice was real,” she remembers. However deficient it seemed in practice, “that never stopped them from doing the work to make it so.”</p><p>Her mother was a college librarian, her father a dockworker, before both became Methodist ministers. Ms Abrams and her five siblings were immersed in books and their father’s bedtime stories. Family life was infused with volunteering and a sense of service: “I tease them that you had these two black people and their six black children trying to fix Mississippi.” Nowadays her siblings serve as first readers and advisers on her fiction. One is a district-court judge, another an anthropologist, a third a biologist; she drew on each for “While Justice Sleeps”.</p><p>Writing and publishing fiction takes grit. False starts and dead ends are routine. Ms Abrams learned that early, too. She wanted her first book to be an espionage tale, but was told no one would publish an unknown female writer. She tossed in a hot love affair, and was off. Her romances have sold over 100,000 copies; the first three will soon be re-released. She applied the lesson to her political career: “You may want to do something one way, but it may not work out the way you planned—so you just have to find a different way.”</p><p>As an 18-year-old freshman at Spelman College, Ms Abrams made a spreadsheet plan for her life. She aimed to be a bestselling spy novelist by 24 and mayor of Atlanta by 35. She was elected to Georgia’s House of Representatives in 2006, leading the minority Democratic caucus from 2011 to 2017. Then she decided to run for governor, becoming America’s first black and female gubernatorial candidate from a major party. But even the most carefully plotted lives have unexpected twists. In 2018 she lost a tight race marred by credible accusations that her opponent suppressed tens of thousands of mostly minority votes.</p><p>It was then, Ms Abrams says, “that my story really started”. Rather than continuing to seek office, she focused on the systemic problem of access to voting, founding two non-profit groups and becoming a national political star. Faced with another obstacle, she swerved round it.</p><p>Her novels are stuffed with both action and arcane expertise, diving into specialised subjects from bioethics to cognitive science to competitive poker. In “While Justice Sleeps” Avery must unravel an international conspiracy involving a corrupt president, genetic warfare, an obscure disease and an equally abstruse chess strategy. The byzantine plot is sometimes hard to follow; a voracious consumer of culture, from “Star Trek” to classic literature, Ms Abrams throws everything into the mix. She fits her writing into her schedule where she can, finishing the book last year in the heat of the election drama.</p><p>The lives of others<br>Storytelling skills inform everything she does, she says. The challenge may be stopping a shadowy network wrecking a community (as in some of her previous books); or, in real life, “how do you make sure that we get climate action or criminal-justice reform?” Either way, “the architecture is always the same”. Every problem can be analysed using the tripartite structure of a fictional protagonist’s journey: what a character (or citizen) wants, why they want it, and how they will get there. Most important, she reckons, is helping people see themselves as active agents in their own narratives. “I try to tell a story of where we are and where we can go.”</p><p>Her most helpful writerly tool may be a knack for putting herself in someone else’s shoes, and encouraging others to do the same. In the statehouse she presented herself as a “pragmatic progressive” who could work with opponents. She describes a friendship with one that developed as they swapped life stories early in the morning in an empty chamber. That helped her convince the ardently pro-life Republican to vote against an abortion bill he was expected to support. “I used my storytelling, but also my listening to the stories of others,” she says. “You cannot influence behaviour if you dismiss the core ideology that people hold”; and you cannot understand that “unless you inhabit” their point of view.</p><p>At this fraught time, with Americans locked into two opposing narratives about last year’s elections, do the tools of fiction offer hope? Ms Abrams doubts that today’s chasm can be completely bridged. But she believes in the power of stories, told one-to-one across the divide. “Our obligation”, she says, “is to get as close as we can, as often as we can.” </p><p><a id="the-complex-legacy-of-thomas-becket%E2%80%99s-life-and-death"></a></p><h1 id="The-complex-legacy-of-Thomas-Becket’s-life-and-death"><a href="#The-complex-legacy-of-Thomas-Becket’s-life-and-death" class="headerlink" title="The complex legacy of Thomas Becket’s life and death"></a>The complex legacy of Thomas Becket’s life and death</h1><p>An infamous medieval assassination echoes down the centuries</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It could have been a scene from “The Sopranos”, only the irascible capo was King Henry II of England. The irksome upstart who had to be neutralised was Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. “Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?” Henry snapped in 1170, or words to that effect. His oblique command was to become a proverbial case of gangsterism dressed in plausible deniability.</p><p>The shocking murder that resulted is at the heart of a new exhibition at the British Museum, its first to open since the pandemic struck last year. A replica altar occupies an otherwise empty space. Menacing music accompanies an audiovisual re-enactment. Four knights who take up Henry’s hint (or challenge) seem to cast long shadows on the walls; monks chant dolefully in Latin; a bell tolls. And the blood of the king’s erstwhile friend and lord chancellor splatters the wall like poppy petals.</p><p>As the many eyewitness accounts attest, the reality was far ghastlier—heavy medieval armour clanging against the cold flagstones of Canterbury Cathedral as the crowd shrank back, the shouts of a cornered man, a sword-swipe that sliced off the top of Becket’s head as if it were a boiled egg. Later, when the monks finally undressed the corpse, beneath his fine vestments he was found to have worn a hair shirt crawling with vermin. After spending six years in exile in France Becket had returned to England, not just to speak truth to power and defend the church’s privileges against the monarchy’s encroachments, but to offer his life up to God.</p><p>“It’s no overstatement to say that Becket’s murder was the crime of the century, and one of the most notorious events of the entire medieval period,” says Naomi Speakman, one of the curators. Recognising his martyrdom, onlookers dipped their cloaks in the blood. News of his death quickly reached the king—and the pope. Becket had been “a real mover and shaker across Europe”, says Ms Speakman, and his bones were carried across the continent in jewelled reliquaries, examples of which are on display in the show. It brings home how enmeshed medieval England was with the European mainland. Like Becket, Henry had French ancestry; he ruled more French territory than the French king did.</p><p>Eagerly repeated stories of people being cured after drinking “Thomas’s water”, an essence of blood so diluted it was hardly pink, led quickly to calls for Becket’s canonisation and the birth of a cult. Three years after his murder, he was made a saint. For Henry, amid all that, there was no forgiveness—however much he insisted that he had not intended Becket’s death. A 12th-century baptismal font, still in use in a small church in southern Sweden, shows Becket kneeling in prayer as the knights fall upon him. A crowned man encouraging the violence is labelled rex.hricvs.</p><p>If the king’s offhand thuggery became an archetype, so did his belated fear: fear of the man who will not be cowed. Three and a half centuries after Becket’s demise, Henry VIII was so wary of his cult’s power that he had it suppressed by Thomas Cromwell—like Becket, a commoner elevated by a monarch’s caprice, then destroyed by it. In Martin Luther King, Archbishop Óscar Romero (killed as he celebrated mass in San Salvador in 1980) and perhaps, today, Alexei Navalny, Becket’s steadfastness in the face of death found modern avatars too. That dual legacy makes the story recounted in this show enduringly gripping.</p><p><a id="patrick-radden-keefe-traces-the-roots-of-america%E2%80%99s-opioid-epidemic"></a></p><h1 id="Patrick-Radden-Keefe-traces-the-roots-of-America’s-opioid-epidemic"><a href="#Patrick-Radden-Keefe-traces-the-roots-of-America’s-opioid-epidemic" class="headerlink" title="Patrick Radden Keefe traces the roots of America’s opioid epidemic"></a>Patrick Radden Keefe traces the roots of America’s opioid epidemic</h1><p>Introduced in 1996, OxyContin generated vast sales—and led to enormous suffering</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Empire of Pain. By Patrick Radden Keefe. Doubleday; 560 pages; $32.50. Picador; £20</p><p>At 50,000 overdose deaths a year and rising, America’s opioid crisis has never been worse. What began in the late 1990s as an epidemic of prescription pain-pill abuse morphed into a worse one of illicit heroin and, later, fentanyl. Prosecutors and the public have zeroed in on Purdue Pharma, which introduced the blockbuster drug OxyContin in 1996. Of the colossal revenues it generated, some $13bn was paid to the company’s previously low-profile owners, members of the Sackler family, who have recently sunk from honoured arts patrons to society pariahs.</p><p>Patrick Radden Keefe’s excellent new book tells the story of this now-infamous clan. He traces the empire of the title to Brooklyn in 1920, and a trio of brothers born to Jewish immigrants: Arthur (the eldest and, in Mr Keefe’s telling, the “patriarch”), Raymond and Mortimer. Arthur Sackler’s business acumen and questionable ethical judgment proved lucrative. He in effect invented the field of medical advertising, creating the first family fortune after aggressively marketing the sedatives Librium and Valium to doctors, without a serious study of the addiction risks. A fascination with Chinese artefacts led him to bequeath huge sums to prestigious museums. For decades the Sackler name would primarily be associated with that largesse.</p><p>Arthur died in 1987, almost a decade before Purdue, which the brothers had acquired in 1952, began selling OxyContin. By the time that happened, his branch of the family no longer held a stake—facts that its members hope will exonerate them from the taint of the “OxySacklers”. But after a gripping if lengthy account of the patriarch’s career in the first third of his book, Mr Keefe’s view is less forgiving. “So many of the antecedents of the saga of OxyContin could be found in the life of Arthur Sackler,” he concludes.</p><p>For the other two brothers and their descendants, Purdue yielded money beyond even Arthur’s imaginings. “The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense and white,” Richard Sackler, son of Raymond, promised at the launch party for OxyContin. His words proved all too prophetic. The plan for mass-market opioids was abetted by misleading advertising, which claimed that less than 1% of patients would become addicted, and a vast salesforce incentivised by lucrative commissions.</p><p>The company peddled theories of “pseudo-addiction” (for which the cure was said to be more opioids) and of “opiophobia” among sceptical doctors. The guardrails against harm buckled in the face of Purdue’s wealth and the lawyers and lobbyists it could buy. Regulators endorsed ludicrous claims about the drug’s safety. A serious case brought by federal prosecutors in Virginia in the early 2000s was watered down by the Department of Justice. Thousands of doctors were given all-expenses-paid trips. Altogether, OxyContin took in $35bn in sales.</p><p>The results were brutal. Other drug manufacturers soon followed Purdue’s lead. When OxyContin was reformulated in 2010 to make it more difficult to abuse, many Americans who were already addicted switched to heroin and, eventually, fentanyl. In 2019 a team of economists rigorously evaluating OxyContin’s impact concluded that its introduction and marketing “explain a substantial share of overdose deaths” over 20 years.</p><p>Purdue is now the subject of many lawsuits brought by state and city governments. Sifting through the reams of evidence unearthed by court proceedings, Mr Keefe shows how callous some of the remaining Sacklers have been over the destruction wrought around them—blaming the problem on immoral addicts rather than the drug, and regarding themselves as victims of a media witch-hunt. Shiftless third-generation types are rendered with evident loathing, skilfully skewered by their own words in court or by Mr Keefe’s (anonymous) sources. One aspiring fashionista wishes an obstreperous journalist would focus less on her last name and more on the hoodies she designs.</p><p>The company pleaded guilty to assorted federal charges over its handling of OxyContin in November 2020. No Sacklers, and no executives, were obliged to acknowledge guilt personally, however, “as if the corporation had acted autonomously, like a driverless car”, Mr Keefe observes. Still, the Sackler name is mud. Museums and universities refuse their money. The Sackler wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which houses an ancient Egyptian temple, was targeted by protesters chanting “Temple of greed! Temple of Oxy!” Purdue is bankrupt (and may not pay the retirement benefits of its salespeople).</p><p>Yet ongoing legal efforts to claw back the fortunes extracted by the owners appear unlikely to succeed. The implosion of the empire of pain, it seems, comes with a golden parachute.</p><p><a id="when-napoleon-stole-a-venetian-masterpiece"></a></p><h1 id="When-Napoleon-stole-a-Venetian-masterpiece"><a href="#When-Napoleon-stole-a-Venetian-masterpiece" class="headerlink" title="When Napoleon stole a Venetian masterpiece"></a>When Napoleon stole a Venetian masterpiece</h1><p>Cynthia Saltzman tells a poignant story of conflict and culture</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Plunder. By Cynthia Saltzman. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 336 pages; $30. Published in Britain as “Napoleon’s Plunder and the Theft of Veronese’s Feast”; Thames &amp; Hudson; £25</p><p>In september 1797 Napoleon Bonaparte’s troops stripped a huge 16th-century painting by Paolo Veronese from the wall of a Venetian monastery. Rolled around a wooden cylinder and packed into a crate smothered with tar, “The Wedding Feast at Cana” was shipped to the Louvre. Plundering art was designed “to rattle foes” and “leave a wound close to their hearts”, writes Cynthia Saltzman. Her perceptive book traces Napoleon’s systematic gathering of artistic treasures as he conquered Italy, focusing on Veronese’s masterpiece.</p><p>“The Wedding Feast” depicts Jesus turning water into wine at a party in Galilee. Veronese sets his version in aristocratic Venice. Marble columns and balustrades frame a boisterous cast of 130 life-size figures in sumptuous brocade and pearls. Servants swarm around the guests; onlookers throw flowers into the air. At the centre of the dining table sits Jesus, his head encircled by a halo of golden light. For this vast work—a “wonder of the world”, as Giacomo Barri put it in 1671—Veronese was paid a third more than Tintoretto was for his “Crucifixion” a couple of years later.</p><p>Napoleon engineered his quarrel with Venice. When a French ship tried to sail unauthorised into the lagoon in April 1797 the Venetians opened fire. Several soldiers were killed; war was declared. Venice soon surrendered. According to a treaty drawn up by Napoleon, the city promised to hand over 3m francs, five warships, 500 manuscripts and 20 paintings. A French art committee selected the works.</p><p>Even amid the somewhat excessive detail of battle campaigns and negotiations, the book keeps sight of the rich personalities linked by the painting. Veronese was a “first-draft”, speedy painter, rarely making mistakes or alterations (Titian, by contrast, was a ponderous reviser). After meeting Napoleon in 1796, a Venetian governor described him as “a vain man who believes he is superhuman”. An envoy saw him as “anything but good-looking”. Napoleon’s own claims to intellectual prowess—“a singular thing about me is my memory”—are put in perspective; he ranked 42nd out of 58 in his final military exam. Jacques-Louis David’s portrait of 1805 obsequiously shows him charging across the Alps on a virile white horse. Ms Saltzman says he rode a donkey on the steepest parts.</p><p>She is very good on Napoleon’s justifications for theft. The French, he said, were doing Europe a favour by rescuing these Italian masterpieces from neglect and obscurity. Previously only a few could see them; at the Louvre they would be on display to everyone. “Spoils of war” became “a public good”, Ms Saltzman writes. Meanwhile Napoleon and his wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais, dipped into the hoard to decorate their properties.</p><p>After his defeat in 1815, France returned only half the artworks stolen from Italy. “The Wedding Feast” was not among them, the Louvre’s boss claiming it would not survive the journey. Ms Saltzman ends with the painting’s life thereafter, including its influence on Vincent van Gogh and John Ruskin, and its concealment from the Nazis in assorted chateaux. Recently it has hung opposite, and in the shadow of, the “Mona Lisa”—a poignant end to an absorbing story of conflict and culture.</p><p><a id="rahul-raina%E2%80%99s-debut-novel-is-a-rollicking-urban-adventure"></a></p><h1 id="Rahul-Raina’s-debut-novel-is-a-rollicking-urban-adventure"><a href="#Rahul-Raina’s-debut-novel-is-a-rollicking-urban-adventure" class="headerlink" title="Rahul Raina’s debut novel is a rollicking urban adventure"></a>Rahul Raina’s debut novel is a rollicking urban adventure</h1><p>And a biting satire of inequality in India</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>How to Kidnap the Rich. By Rahul Raina. Harper Perennial; 336 pages; $17.00. Little, Brown; £14.99</p><p>“The first kidnapping wasn’t my fault,” pleads the narrator, Ramesh Kumar, at the start of this debut novel. “The others—those were definitely me.” He recounts waking up on a floor next to the comatose, vomit-streaked teenager in his care, Rudi Saxena. A man wielding a cosh bursts in and takes the pair away. Ramesh loses a finger, Rudi is ransomed for $6m, and the abduction inspires them to turn from “kidnappees” into kidnappers.</p><p>Having snared readers with this gritty opening, Rahul Raina, a Kashmiri-British writer, traces the events that led to his characters’ desperate circumstances. Ramesh is an “educational consultant” who sits tests on behalf of the offspring of New Delhi’s elite. Rudi’s parents request the premium package for their dim-witted, spoilt-brat son, covering exams that are “the gateway to the best universities, the brightest futures, the whitest lives”. Ramesh comes top in the whole country.</p><p>Overnight, Rudi is transformed into a national celebrity with his own game show; Ramesh assumes the role of his manager and extorts a ten-percent cut. The affection of Priya, an assistant producer on the show, is an added bonus. But gradually his luck changes. Rudi spirals out of control on drink and drugs, an investigator trawls through his poor school results and smells a rat—and a slighted rival and a vengeful enemy swoop in to settle scores.</p><p>Like Mohsin Hamid’s “How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia”, “How to Kidnap the Rich” purports to be a how-to manual but is in fact a rollicking urban adventure and a biting satire of inequality. Mr Raina adds a fast-paced crime caper and a stream of caustic humour. “I know a lie the size of ‘the British are only setting up a trading post’ when I see one,” remarks Ramesh. A man turning pale is “whiter than a Western panel on racial diversity”; a woman is “busier than our civil servants are in January editing government websites to remove any mention of last year’s targets”.</p><p>Some of the jokes fall flat. Ramesh’s moving back-story, and a farcical sequence in which he and his partner in crime disguise themselves in saris, belong in different books. Despite its over-exuberance, though, this is a highly entertaining first novel from a writer to watch. </p><p><a id="obituary---ts-shanbhag-died-of-coronavirus-on-may-4th"></a></p><h1 id="Obituary-—T-S-Shanbhag-died-of-coronavirus-on-May-4th"><a href="#Obituary-—T-S-Shanbhag-died-of-coronavirus-on-May-4th" class="headerlink" title="(Obituary)—T.S.

Shanbhag died of coronavirus on May 4th</h1><p>The proprietor of Premier Book Shop on Church Street was 84</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>On days when he was working, T.S. Shanbhag kept to the same routine. He would drive in from the west of the city and park near M. Chinnaswamy stadium by 8.30am. From there he would walk to the centre, to Koshy’s restaurant on St Mark’s Road, where he had his morning coffee: the best in Bangalore, proper south Indian, milky yet strong. It was hard to resist the breakfasts on offer, appam with vegetable stew, potato smileys and the rest, served by waiters who glided about with the deference of English butlers. But he preferred just to banter with his old friend Prem Koshy, who would greet him with a hearty “How are you, my dear Sir?” and later, repaying the favour, might well drop in to buy books.</p><p>Premier Book Shop stood diagonally opposite, on Church Street, a modest place shaded by a honge tree. His place and Koshy’s were relics of the sleepy Bangalore of the past, before it became tech city and the malls and multiplexes moved in. Increasingly now the corner swarmed with traffic, hooting motorbikes and swerving autorickshaws, but he dodged neatly between them. He was limber from all his crouching and stretching to retrieve this or that book, daily acrobatics in the service of good reading.</p><p>The shop was about 15 feet wide and 25 feet long, fine for his purposes when he moved in in 1971. He had been working at his uncle’s Strand Book Stall in Mumbai, the best job he could find as a village boy from near Kundapur, but for various reasons it was best after a while to start up on his own. This place had been a clothing store, but had been burned out; he paid 900 rupees to rent it, and gradually filled it with five lakh (500,000) books. They not only lined every wall but were piled in an eight-storey mountain in the middle. If you dug to the bottom of it, you would discover the reading habits of Bangaloreans three decades before. He had made the mountain carefully, placing each volume in a slanting position, so that by an apparent miracle it did not fall down. Round it his customers moved clockwise and sideways, as if in a temple of words.</p><p>His own little den was just inside the door, behind a desk stacked so high with books and invoices that only his head was visible. From there, with his quiet smile, he greeted the customers in English or Kannada and fetched what they could not find. Some liked to stand and read for hours, leaving without buying, but that was fine. Others rifled through the stacks, pulling them out of all order (for there was a system, in his mind at least), knowing that you could turn up older and cheaper editions under the newer ones, and special treasures, Borges or Fellini perhaps, from the lower right-hand stack near the window. He placidly wiped and sorted after them. Children were parked in the shop while their parents went off somewhere, and that was fine too; there was a little stool in a corner where they could sit, and a pile of abridged Penguin Classics. When his child visitors flowered into writers, poets and historians, he took a modest pride in that.</p><p>His grown-up customers were treated with the same care. His shop was intellectually serious: few novels, thrillers, or that bestselling kind of thing, but instead a feast of new books in English on history, biography, science, economics and world literature (his own favourite author was Camus). He provided food for minds, as Koshy’s provided it for bodies. And every book was at a discount, the first at a bookshop in Bangalore, of 10% off everything. If he saw an impoverished student sighing over a volume, then putting it back, he would let them borrow it instead. When orders were needed urgently, he would drive across the city to deliver them in person. No action gave him so much joy as putting a book that was wanted into someone’s hand.</p><p>He also knew what his regulars wanted before they knew themselves. He kept a psychological track of their purchases, not on any computer (since he disliked all that, filling out his invoices by hand or on a sturdy ancient typewriter), but in his brain, as good exercise. That brain already contained all the titles of a crowd of authors, as well as the whereabouts of any book in the shop; it also contained the comics customers had bought, years ago, with their first pocket money, and their shifting interests since. Armed with this he would softly approach, in his leather slippers, and say to a browser, “Why don’t you try….?” Customers often complained of leaving with many more books than they had meant to buy; or coming in for a book on cricket, and leaving with one on Marx.</p><p>In return, the customers cared about him. They nagged him, though kindly, to take credit cards, which he did with great reluctance, and to expand his business when the restaurant closed next door, though he had no ambitions that way. He saw himself as a friendly local librarian, rather than a businessman. When a huge increase in rents around Church Street threatened the shop, it seemed that most of Bangalore helped him with donations. Those kept him going for two years, but in 2009 he had to shut it down.</p><p>He was perfectly sanguine about it. He had been at Premier for 38 years, and was getting old. His eyes, with all that reading, were not so good. Besides, change was part of life; there was no need to get emotional. He sold the books at 60% discount, and gave the rest to libraries all over the city. Even the name-board was recycled, and the shop became a fancy bar. His walks now took him to the other bookshops in the city, where he was just one more customer browsing.</p><p>The passing of Premier was much mourned; but his own death seemed to affect the city more. At first sight, this seemed strange. On that day, 161 Bangaloreans died of the virus. He was probably among the most unassuming of them. But what had also died with him, many felt, was a rare part of old Bangalore, an unhurried place far distant from the slick and booming version, together with an old-fashioned style of quiet full-hearted service. In that small corner of the city he had made a sanctuary, along with Prem Koshy, whose coffee had kept him and the browsers going. Koshy’s was open as usual; the metal blinds came down only for lockdowns or personal bereavements. But inside Mr Koshy sighed for “the angel of my books”. </p>]]></content>

At next year’s presidential election, the party the wily leader carried triumphantly to power in 1981 could make history again, but for rather a different reason. The Socialist Party runs the risk of failing to make it to the final run-off vote twice in a row.</p><p>A year ahead of any election, polls need to be treated with caution. French history is littered with early favourites—Alain Juppé, Dominique Strauss-Kahn—who never made it to the Elysée. A year before the presidential vote in 2017, the name Emmanuel Macron had not been tested in a single poll. An average of polls this year, which assume that Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, will be the Socialists’ candidate, suggests that the party would get just 8% in the first round. This would not be enough to get her through to the run-off. Worse, were she in fact to make it through and face Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), polls say Ms Le Pen would win.</p><p>Four years after Mr Macron upended French politics, the country’s formerly dominant forces—on both the left and the right—have never looked so weak or unstable. The left remains divided. The greens (Europe Écologie Les Verts) captured some big cities at municipal elections last year. But nationally they struggle, and disagree among themselves. Polls say that Yannick Jadot, who is widely predicted to be the greens’ presidential candidate, would also lose to Ms Le Pen in a run-off. Last month he organised a meeting in Paris with other parties of the left to try to chart a way to a common candidate. The effort failed, not least because Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the left-wing Unsubmissive France, was absent, defying lockdown with a jaunt to Latin America to check on Bolivian socialism.</p><p>Matters look little better on the right. The Republicans are again bleeding talent. Mr Macron poached many of their moderates to serve in his government, including two prime ministers (Edouard Philippe and now Jean Castex) and a finance minister, Bruno Le Maire. Last week, amid high local drama, Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice and a former minister, quit the Republicans too. Ahead of regional elections next month, he was furious that the party had refused an electoral deal with Mr Macron’s La République en Marche (LREM) in the Provence region, in order to thwart Ms Le Pen’s candidate there.</p><p>As it is, neither of the two strongest candidates for the presidency on the right is even a card-carrying member of the Republicans any more. Xavier Bertrand, head of the Hauts-de-France region in the north, and Valérie Pécresse, head of the Paris region, have both quit the party. At the heart of the Republicans’ bitter internal row is how, and whether, to fight the far right. When he walked out, Mr Estrosi declared that a right-wing faction with an ambiguous attitude to the RN had “taken the party hostage”. The Republicans, he said, needed to state publicly that their priority is to keep the RN out of power, at all times.</p><p>What to make of this volatility? First, parties in France, which lack the tribal loyalty once enjoyed by those in Britain, say, or Germany, are no longer a determining factor in electoral politics. Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s former Brexit negotiator, may be hoping to stage a bid for the presidency from within the Republicans. But, “over the past five years,” says Emmanuel Rivière, of Kantar, a polling group, “the party that most of the French feel the closest to is ‘no party’.” Mr Macron exploited the tools offered by the Fifth Republic’s constitution, including the two-round election, to run for president without one. Mr Bertrand, who has declared his candidacy, is trying to do the same in 2022. If a candidate emerges who consistently polls better than Mr Macron against Ms Le Pen, this—rather than party backing—could be the basis of a serious presidential bid.</p><p>Second, there has been a “droitisation”, or shift to the right, among the French electorate. Since 2017, the share of voters describing themselves as being on the right has risen by five points, to 38%, according to the Fondation pour l’Innovation Politique, a think-tank; that on the left has dropped by a point, to 24%. This too has blurred traditional voting patterns. In his time, Mitterrand could count on the votes of the Communist Party, then deeply rooted in industrial and mining areas, to help him win in the run-off. Today, the main beneficiary of the working-class vote is Ms Le Pen’s RN. Fully 48% of blue-collar workers told a poll they would back her next year in the first round; just 2% would vote for Ms Hidalgo and 4% for Mr Jadot.</p><p>Third, this shift has been accompanied by a growing convergence of views on cultural values between Republican and RN supporters. According to a study by the Fondation Jean Jaurès, a think-tank, there is now almost no gap between the two electorates on security, law and order, and attitudes to Islam. When a group of (mostly) retired military officers, many linked to the far right, signed a petition last month in favour of the army stepping in to restore order, an astonishing 71% of Republican voters approved. This convergence is exactly what Ms Le Pen hopes to exploit, and use to split the Republican party.</p><p>The collapse of traditional parties, which he himself engineered, could help Mr Macron. Polls suggest that in 2022 he is again likely to face Ms Le Pen in a run-off. Yet where the candidate in 2017 embodied a balance of left- and right-leaning views, the president has in office followed the electorate’s rightwards shift, appointing not only two prime ministers from the centre-right but Gérald Darmanin, his hard-line interior minister.</p><p>This carries a risk: that disillusioned voters on the left refuse to back Mr Macron in the second round, even against Ms Le Pen. For exactly this reason, polls currently give Mr Macron a far slimmer victory over her than he managed in 2017. “He’s really got to reach out to the left,” says one LREM deputy. For all the other parties’ disarray, Mr Macron remains on uncertain ground. And, as France remembers Mitterrand’s first election, one feature in particular will doubtless be in Ms Le Pen’s mind. She is on her third election campaign—just as Mitterrand was when he triumphed in 1981.</p><p><a id="plentiful-renewable-energy-is-opening-up-a-new-industrial-frontier"></a></p><h1 id="Plentiful-renewable-energy-is-opening-up-a-new-industrial-frontier"><a href="#Plentiful-renewable-energy-is-opening-up-a-new-industrial-frontier" class="headerlink" title="Plentiful renewable energy is opening up a new industrial frontier"></a>Plentiful renewable energy is opening up a new industrial frontier</h1><p>Competitors are alarmed</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Norrland is the largest of Sweden’s three historical “lands”. It spans the top half of the country and is sparsely populated, the more so the farther north you go. The few people who live there have long relied for work on mining, the army and forestry. Most of Sweden’s industry is far to the south. But Norrland abounds in hydropower. Power that is cheap and—crucially—green, along with bargain land and proximity to iron ore, is sparking an improbable industrial revolution, based on hydrogen, “green” steel and batteries.</p><p>ssab, a steelmaker, is poised to deliver its first consignment of “eco-steel” from a hydrogen-fuelled pilot plant in Lulea, a northern city. Volvo, an industrial-vehicle firm these days, will use the steel to build lorries. Of the six or seven tonnes that its typical lorry weighs, around five consist of steel. And for each tonne of steel produced using fossil fuels, around two tonnes of planet-cooking carbon dioxide get belched into the atmosphere.</p><p>To make steel, iron ore must be melted at high temperatures and reduced from iron oxide to iron, a process that typically involves burning fossil fuels, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Replacing them with hydrogen as a reducing agent eliminates more than 98% of the carbon dioxide normally released. The hydrogen is made by electrolysing water, using electricity produced by hydro-power. This approach involves almost no carbon-dioxide emissions at all.</p><p>Scania, another automotive firm, is also hoping to exploit Norrland’s cheap hydro-power. It plans to make 15,000 battery-powered trucks a year by 2025, around 15% of its annual production. To that end it has invested in Northvolt, a new battery-making enterprise powered by Norrland’s hydro-electricity. Northvolt’s main facility is in Skelleftea, 130km south-west of Lulea. It is also building a battery-recycling plant there (see Science section). By the end of 2021 the company hopes to have churned out enough batteries to store 16 gigawatt-hours. Carl-Erik Lagercrantz, Northvolt’s chairman, wants to scale that up eventually to 150 gigawatt-hours a year. If he does so by 2030, he will be supplying a sizeable amount of the European Union’s expected annual demand of some 450 gigawatt-hours of electric-vehicle battery capacity by 2030.</p><p>Mr Lagercrantz also wants to get into the green-steel business. Taking inspiration from ssab’s pilot project, he decided to have a go at hydrogen-based steelmaking too, and founded h2 Green Steel. Production will be based in Boden, an old army town 30km north-west of Lulea. The new plant will make 5m tonnes of flat steel a year by 2030, a small but meaningful percentage of the 90m tonnes that is currently consumed annually in the eu.</p><p>Northern Sweden’s steelmaking leaps are being emulated elsewhere in Europe, in response to similar environmental pressures which will only increase if, as looks very likely, Germany’s Greens enter government after the election in September. Europe produces a still significant 16% of the world’s steel. Big producers in Germany and Poland, where the industry is mostly coal-based and very dirty, are nervy. Even neighbouring Norway is in danger of losing out. It too has the gift of rich renewable-energy resources, but underinvestment means there may soon not be enough of this green electricity to meet the demands of both households and industry.</p><p>Meanwhile, all the green-tinged investments have knock-on effects for the rest of the economy of northern Sweden. Claes Nordmark, the mayor of Boden, says house prices are rising and contractors are queuing up to build apartment blocks in anticipation of h2 Green Steel’s new facility. Other companies are vying to supply the steelmaker, or to take advantage of its products. Expecting a jump in population, Mr Nordmark and his colleagues in the region are building schools and sporting facilities. Your correspondent encouraged him to abandon Swedish reticence and brag. “Those in the south think there is nothing here. But now we can offer the green jobs that people dream of—and an amazing lifestyle,” he beams. </p><p><a id="the-eu-is-trying-to-become-a-welfare-superstate"></a></p><h1 id="The-EU-is-trying-to-become-a-welfare-superstate"><a href="#The-EU-is-trying-to-become-a-welfare-superstate" class="headerlink" title="The EU is trying to become a welfare superstate"></a>The EU is trying to become a welfare superstate</h1><p>But its powers to deliver on its “social pillar” are limited</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Europe is to the welfare state what Canada is to ice hockey: the birthplace and the summit of the art. The European Union boasts a “unique social market economy” that “protects us against the great risks of life”, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, told a summit of eu leaders on May 7th. They had met in Porto, Portugal’s second city, to approve a plan for turning the union into a bulwark of social protection, with targets for raising employment, improving job training and reducing poverty, as well as looser goals such as fighting gender inequality and regulating the gig economy.</p><p>Yet Europe’s welfare states are administered by national governments, not by the eu. The European Commission’s powerful regulatory authority rarely extends to social policy. As for eu spending, even with a new €750bn ($910bn) covid-19 recovery fund added to its regular €1.1tn seven-year budget, it amounts to less than 2% of the bloc’s gdp over the period. That pales in comparison to members’ social spending alone, which runs from 13% of gdp (Ireland) to 31% (France). Pensions, unemployment, health care, minimum wages and collective bargaining are national affairs.</p><p>That is why the level of social protection varies so much. In Romania, Emil Iliuta, an unemployed 63-year-old locksmith, has been drawing benefits since December. He gets 140 lei ($35) a month, along with occasional food donations. In exchange he performs 11 hours a month of community labour such as digging graves.</p><p>In the Netherlands, meanwhile, Sascha Blokzijl has been drawing benefits since January after losing her job at a data-analytics company. She gets €2,135 per month after taxes; the minimum for an adult living alone is €1,233. Rather than digging graves, Ms Blokzijl was initially required to report just one work-search activity per week. Having decided to start a business herself, she must now simply get her plan approved by the employment office.</p><p>The eu’s new social emphasis marks a reversal from the financial and euro crises between 2007 and 2011, when it required members to enact tough austerity measures. After Britain’s vote to leave in 2016, policymakers concluded that they needed to offer citizens more tangible benefits to stop anti-eu populism. “The whole idea of ‘a Europe that protects’ is linked to that wake-up call,” says Luuk van Middelaar of Leiden University. A summit in Gothenburg in 2017 adopted a “European social pillar” with 20 lofty-sounding rights, from lifelong training to work-life balance. The Porto summit was supposed to start achieving them.</p><p>Portugal’s Socialist government, which convened the summit as the current holder of the eu’s rotating presidency, is a fan of the social pillar. But other countries are less enthusiastic. Before the summit, 11 members issued a statement warning the commission not to interfere in social policy. They included fiscal hawks such as the Netherlands as well as the Nordic countries, who think eu rules might undercut their own standards.</p><p>The new action plan does not promise to equalise benefits. But it does aim by 2030 to raise the eu’s overall employment level to 78% of the population aged 20-64, a level now met only by countries like Germany, and to reduce the number of citizens in poverty by at least 15m. It also pledges annual skills training for 60% of all adults. This may be feasible for countries like Denmark, which pioneered such training and job-search efforts, known as “active labour market programmes”. For Romania and Italy it will be harder.</p><p>Backers hope the social pillar will nudge weaker member states to mimic the success of others. “The strength of Europe is in sharing best practices,” says Sofia Fernandes of the Delors Institute, a think-tank in Paris. The targets will become part of the European Commission’s system of scolding members to improve their economies. And money from the €750bn recovery fund can be used for social-pillar goals.</p><p>Yet perhaps the most successful new eu social programme is not part of the social pillar. The €100bn sure programme, launched at the start of the pandemic, helps poorer countries pay their unemployment bills by letting the commission borrow money on their behalf, taking advantage of the eu’s strong collective credit. But making sure permanent is not under discussion. Nicolas Schmidt, the eu commissioner for jobs and social rights, says that with the economy recovering from covid-19, it is time to focus on employment rather than joblessness.</p><p>One measure being discussed is an eu-wide social-security number or id card. This would help ensure that companies that send workers across borders pay social-insurance premiums to the countries they work in. It would also help workers get the benefits they are entitled to, says Agnes Jongerius, a Dutch member of the European Parliament.</p><p>Another candidate for European regulation is the platform economy. Drivers for Uber and programmers on Fiverr tend to fall into a regulatory gap between employees and contractors, and lose out on labour rights. Different national approaches have created confusion, and the European Court of Justice has been forced to step in. The commission aims to come up with a legislative proposal by the end of the year.</p><p>Defining platform workers’ social-security status would be just the sort of concrete benefit European officials hope to bring about. But in most areas of social insurance the eu finds it hard to step in, says Bo Rothstein, a Swedish expert on the welfare state. Countries have dramatically different systems with deep local roots. No one thinks they will harmonise them. Ms Von der Leyen is right that Europeans want protection from economic hazards. But the eu may not be their mightiest defender. </p><p><a id="can-the-european-union-learn-from-its-fiscal-mistakes"></a></p><h1 id="Can-the-European-Union-learn-from-its-fiscal-mistakes"><a href="#Can-the-European-Union-learn-from-its-fiscal-mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Can the European Union learn from its fiscal mistakes?"></a>Can the European Union learn from its fiscal mistakes?</h1><p>A gathering economic recovery shows it sometimes can</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing,” Winston Churchill is supposed to have quipped, “after they have exhausted all other possibilities.” There are two problems with the quotation. First, there is no evidence Churchill ever said it. Second, today the phrase applies better to Europe’s leadership than to their friends across the Atlantic.</p><p>Take the European Union’s recovery from the pandemic. For the first time since last spring, economic optimism is in the air. Across Europe, vaccines are going into arms, summer holidays are being booked and bars are opening up. The European Commission has just jacked up its growth forecasts for 2021 and 2022, citing the bloc’s €750bn ($910bn) recovery fund as one of the reasons why. This cash should start appearing in European treasuries later this year. As a whole, the eu’s gdp will be back at its pre-pandemic level by the end of 2021. This is slightly faster than expected and is due to happen only a few months behind America, which has had the benefit of Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s blockbuster stimulus packages. In the ten-year gap between their initially bungling response to the euro-zone crisis and the pandemic, European leaders seem to have learned some lessons, even if they still have not learned them thoroughly enough.</p><p>Where the European Central Bank was actively making things worse a decade ago, it is now helping governments out of their hole. In the spring of 2011 the bank was raising rates and worrying about a brief flurry of inflation, rather than stagnant growth. It was not treated as a lender of last resort until a year later, when Mario Draghi finally pledged to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. Then began Mr Draghi’s long, slow crusade to make the ecb adopt unorthodox measures, such as quantitative easing. As a result the bank is able today to print money, (largely) ignore inflation hawks and keep interest rates at historic lows. Its official mandate of price stability has been replaced by an unofficial creed of supporting economic growth, reducing unemployment and doing “whatever it takes”.</p><p>If the technocrats have changed their tune, so, to some extent, have the politicians. Long-held political certainties have been revisited. During the previous crisis common debt was suggested as a necessary step to guarantee the future of the euro, only to be dismissed by the likes of Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor. Mrs Merkel reversed course last May. After a year of haggling, the commission will begin to issue up to €750bn of the stuff, which will be dished out to countries in the form of cheap loans and grants. True, on a continental level, the scheme is tiny. But for some of the individual countries most in need of the cash it is significant. In Germany, it is a piddling 1% of its gdp. For Italy, though, the figure is about 11% of gdp. Greece, meanwhile, is due €32bn of loans and grants—a useful sum for an economy of roughly €170bn.</p><p>For rich countries, eu funds are a fiscal aperitif. It is up to national governments to pump up their economies in the post-crisis era. Here, again, attitudes have changed, though not yet enough. In contrast to a decade ago, spending is now more likely to be seen as a solution than a sin. Countries such as Greece endured economic vivisection, forced to slash spending rather than stimulate their economies. This approach failed either to reduce Greek debt or to produce faster growth. These days, advocates of a return to austerity are thinner on the ground.</p><p>With luck, political circumstance could embed this new attitude permanently in the eu’s own rules on government spending. Although temporarily suspended during the pandemic, eu countries are obliged to keep deficits below 3% and national debt below 60% of gdp. In an age when the national debt of Italy, the third-largest eu economy, stands at about 160% of gdp, these rules can seem quaint. Europe’s struggling southern economies have called for an overhaul ever since the previous crisis. Now they may get their wish. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has long advocated more forgiving fiscal rules. So has Mr Draghi, now the prime minister of Italy. Meanwhile the rise of the Green Party means that the next German government will probably be the most profligate in a generation. It is a rare alignment which could, just possibly, lead to a more permanent shift.</p><p>Here comes the boom!<br>Boom-mongers have not yet routed the doom-mongers. There is plenty of opportunity to muck things up. Inflation still haunts European politics. While the noises coming from the ecb suggest that a modest rise in inflation this year will be brushed off, this claim will only be properly tested when German politicians start screaming. (The upcoming election will give plenty of excuses for such hysterics.) An improved economic outlook may lessen the pressure on countries to overhaul the eu’s spending rules. Rather than turning the recovery fund into a permanent scheme, ready to issue more debt if needed, some governments will try to keep it a temporary one, setting up a needless drama about rebuilding it in the next crisis. The tyranny of low expectations hangs over the eu. In the previous crisis, mere survival was enough, never mind prosperity. Now waddling only slightly behind America’s economy—never mind China’s—is being held up as an achievement. For a bloc with designs on being a superpower, that is not enough.</p><p>Yet the eu is stronger than its critics allow. It can correct its errors, albeit slowly. It took a decade to unpick the mistakes of the previous crisis. So long as the eu is not a state, it will not have the speed, power or flexibility of one. Across the Atlantic Mr Biden can launch a plan to spend trillions, knowing he has the power to do so. By contrast, eu politics is kaleidoscopic. Consensus must be cooked up among a rotating cast of ministers and amid ever-changing alliances. Reluctant countries have to be slowly cajoled. A stronger, more coherent eu is coming, but not for a while. It could still take a lot longer to exhaust the other options. </p><p><a id="britain---why-boris-johnson-is-recreating-tony-blair%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cdelivery-unit%E2%80%9D"></a></p><h1 id="Britain-—Why-Boris-Johnson-is-recreating-Tony-Blair’s-“delivery-unit”"><a href="#Britain-—Why-Boris-Johnson-is-recreating-Tony-Blair’s-“delivery-unit”" class="headerlink" title="(Britain)—Why Boris Johnson is recreating Tony Blair’s “delivery unit”"></a>(Britain)—Why Boris Johnson is recreating Tony Blair’s “delivery unit”</h1><p>The prime minister promises a more muscular, interventionist state</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Michael barber helped Tony Blair to get stuff done. In 2001 he established a “delivery unit” that translated lofty ambitions into measurable goals—regarding children’s literacy, say, or hospital waiting times—and pursued them relentlessly. This was not always popular. Reflecting a common gripe, one Daily Telegraph columnist raged against the “grinding and dehumanising imposition” of targets reminiscent of Soviet central planning.</p><p>That columnist, now prime minister, has come round to targets. Following a request from Boris Johnson, Sir Michael has since Christmas been hard at work recreating the delivery unit. Brexit and covid-19 are starting to take up less time, and Mr Johnson wishes to reshape the country to the tastes of his new electorate: northern, non-graduate and Brexit-leaning. In the Queen’s Speech on May 11th, the prime minister promised more housebuilding, more technical education, new train lines, new free ports and a new post-Brexit subsidy regime—brought into being by a more interventionist government.</p><p>Covid-19 has left Mr Johnson in charge of a wartime state. Some £303bn ($430bn) went on combating the pandemic in the year to March, driving public debt from 84% of gdp to nearly 100%, its highest ratio since the 1960s. A government quite unprepared for the crisis scrambled to build field hospitals, buy protective equipment for medics and devise a vast logistical operation to deliver vaccines. The civil service, pared back under David Cameron, has grown to its largest since 2011.</p><p>The success of the vaccine programme helped propel the Conservative Party to victory in a by-election in the once-safe Labour seat of Hartlepool on May 6th. It has also changed ministerial thinking about state capacity. “Six months ago, everyone was taking the piss because we were talking about moonshots,” says a cabinet minister. “Now we’re actually doing it.”</p><p>Mr Johnson’s manifesto in the 2019 election promised to improve public services, and to do so in a manner the electorate would notice. The government would build 40 new hospitals, hire 50,000 nurses and fix social care. Now just getting back to pre-pandemic performance levels will be tough. The passport office warns of delays from a glut of renewals. Justice is under strain, with a record 58,000 Crown Court cases delayed. Nearly 400,000 people have been waiting more than a year for hospital treatment, up from fewer than 2,000 before the pandemic. This is stuff that loses elections, and solving it is only partly a matter of funding. Doctors and nurses take time to train, for instance. “You can end up putting a lot more money into these things and not end up getting more sausages,” warns a senior Tory.</p><p>Mr Johnson’s flagship policy, of “levelling up” Britain’s provinces, aims to address weak productivity, and correct a sense of loss and cultural neglect, by creating proper jobs, done by proud people in purposeful towns. Large sums of money will be used to smarten up high streets, bandstands and libraries—all intended to act as a down-payment to show the Tories’ new voters they are serious.</p><p>But while the vision is clear, much of the agenda is still hazy. It lacks a theory of how towns get richer, and measures of progress. As well as Sir Michael, Mr Johnson has drafted in Neil O’Brien, an mp who argues that decline of manufacturing in such towns can and should be reversed, to impose discipline on the programme. Folk close to the process expect a “gradual substantiation” of what the agenda means.</p><p>Sir Michael’s delivery unit will help both with long-standing agendas such as levelling up and with the covid-19 backlog. It will employ 30 or so officials under the command of Emily Lawson, the former head of the National Health Service vaccine programme, and will report directly to the prime minister, providing him with a line of sight into departments. Mr Johnson’s broad goals (such as achieving net-zero emissions) will be split into measurable chunks (such as keeping tabs on electric-car charging-points), and will be pursued using his authority to overcome obstacles. Along with net-zero, levelling-up and the covid-19 backlog, the unit will also focus on jobs and skills.</p><p>The original delivery unit succeeded in cutting hospital waiting times and raising school standards, and has since been copied by governments across the world, from Canada to Sierra Leone. But it drew opposition from critics like Mr Johnson who saw it as an example of Labour’s top-down management style, and others who focused on the potential for poorly designed targets to lead people astray—as when gps responded to a 48-hour treatment target by denying patients the ability to book appointments further ahead.</p><p>Mr Johnson’s unit will be given a formidably broad agenda, cutting across departments; something which may cause problems. In his book “How to Run a Government”, Sir Michael admits the original delivery unit initially struggled under the weight of too many targets, too broadly set.</p><p>It was also aided by hefty budget increases for the public services under its glare; the trade-off, implicitly, being greater accountability and higher standards in return for more money. Given rocketing public debt, the Treasury may be unwilling to splash more cash. But Mr Johnson does not hanker for tight public finances, and voters oppose cutting spending on public services by a margin of more than two-to-one, according to Ipsos mori, a pollster.</p><p>As the Institute for Government think-tank points out, the prime minister is a year-and-a-half into his term and has so far made slow progress on his trickiest manifesto promises. He has an increasingly coherent vision of the state after Brexit and the pandemic, fewer distractions and, if Hartlepool is a sign of things to come, a chance to shape Britain’s future. If he does not make progress now, he never will. </p><p><a id="second-homes-are-coming-under-increasing-attack-in-wales"></a></p><h1 id="Second-homes-are-coming-under-increasing-attack-in-Wales"><a href="#Second-homes-are-coming-under-increasing-attack-in-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Second homes are coming under increasing attack in Wales"></a>Second homes are coming under increasing attack in Wales</h1><p>The nationalists don’t like them</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Rhys tudur strides up onto the cliff edge and surveys the world below. On one side is a steep drop into the Irish Sea. On the other is Nefyn, a picturesque seaside village. But for Mr Tudur, a solicitor and local councillor, it is also a battleground. The enemy are second-home owners, and he points out their stations. Some are big mansions; others are unassuming former council houses. “Soon there won’t be a community here,” he laments.</p><p>This part of north Wales is beautiful, nationalistic and changing quickly as newcomers buy up properties. In Nefyn, around a fifth of properties are second homes. In Abersoch, 12 miles away, 46% are. That village is packed with 4x4s and sports cars driven by Cheshire’s business elite. Tensions are clear. A Welsh flag emblazoned with the words “Nid yw Cymru ar Werth” (“Wales is not for sale”) flies from a window near the seafront.</p><p>Over the past year local people have reported visiting second-home owners to the police, claiming that they have been flouting restrictions. Vandals have scrawled “Go Home” across holiday homes in Pwllheli. A few homeowners have been sent images of matchboxes on social media—a reference to the burning of English-owned holiday homes in the 1980s and 1990s. Others have made their points politely. Mr Tudur led a 20-mile march from Nefyn to Caernarfon; others dug “Hawl i Fyw Adra’‘ (“the right to live at home”) into a beach in Nefyn.</p><p>People who live in lovely areas often complain about newcomers bidding up property prices. But north Wales is unusual, in two ways. First, anxiety about domestic migrants is fused with worries about the decline of Welsh culture in one of its strongholds. Second, local politicians are both willing and able to do something to deter second-home owners.</p><p>Since 2017 Welsh councils have been allowed to impose a tax premium of up to 100% on second homes. For the past few years eight councils have imposed smaller premiums. Several have raised them in the past year. Gwynedd (which includes Nefyn) is charging the full whack. Swansea, in south Wales, also charges 100%.</p><p>St Ives, a pretty town in Cornwall, has tried to ban the construction of second homes altogether. But that intervention backfired. House-building of all kinds slumped, according to Christian Hilber of the London School of Economics. Tourism dropped and unemployment rose. Mr Hilber thinks Wales’s approach is better. Raising taxes brings in money to local councils, who can use them to build more affordable homes. But local tourism will suffer.</p><p>The second-home owners of Gwynedd are not rolling over. A Crowdfunder has raised more than £8,000 for legal advice. It argues that some of the people targeted are pensioners who cannot afford a doubling of their tax bill that will cost some more than £7,000. (“If they can afford a Rolls-Royce, they can afford the fuel that goes in it,” retorts Edgar Wyn Owen, chair of Gwynedd council.)</p><p>Locals might end up with the sort of English homeowner they most dislike. John Brynmor Hughes, a councillor in Abersoch, divides the second-home owners into two groups. The first lot inherited their houses and have amassed connections in the town; the second lot bought their homes more recently at high prices, and may be better able to afford a tax increase. One of the latter, a professional in his 30s from southern England, bought his home on a whim without seeing it in person. He is thinking about declaring his second home as his primary residence: “The councils don’t talk to each other, do they?”</p><p>Campaigners want even more powerful tools. Welsh Labour has suggested a possible devolution of the Land Transaction Tax ( ltt) to local councils. Paid when you buy or lease a building or land over a certain price, the ltt currently has a 4% increase for second-home purchases. Devolving the power to increase the tax to councils would see it rise much higher. Mr Tudur says he would want to raise it to 20%, so that a terraced house worth £180,000 would bear an additional £36,000 in tax. Looking down at the choppy waters below, he likens the council-tax premium to “a wren’s piss in the sea”. It sounds nicer in Welsh. </p><p><a id="international---france-is-confronting-its-history-in-algeria"></a></p><h1 id="International-—France-is-confronting-its-history-in-Algeria"><a href="#International-—France-is-confronting-its-history-in-Algeria" class="headerlink" title="(International)—France is confronting its history in Algeria"></a>(International)—France is confronting its history in Algeria</h1><p>As other countries’ experiences show, dealing with the past is a complex undertaking</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In march, beneath the chandeliers of the Elysée palace, four adult cousins met Emmanuel Macron, France’s president. What really happened, they wanted to know, to their grandfather, Ali Boumendjel, a lawyer and nationalist, who died in colonial Algeria after his arrest by French troops in 1957? Officially he committed suicide. In fact, Mr Macron acknowledged, Boumendjel was tortured and killed by the French army. His body was thrown from a window to disguise the cause of death.</p><p>The president and the lawyer’s grandchildren—all of the same generation—engaged in an “extraordinary dialogue”, says Benjamin Stora, a historian who was present. The cousins’ discomfort, he says, focused on a question: “How can we live in the country that assassinated our grandfather?” Although a French general had confessed 20 years ago to ordering the murder of Boumendjel, the government had never admitted the crime. Algeria’s eight-year war for independence ended in 1962. But such questions trouble a younger generation, who feel that France should fully acknowledge the atrocities it committed.</p><p>Earlier this year Mr Macron decided to launch a “Memories and Truth” commission on France’s role in Algeria, to “look clearly at the wounds of the past”. While in Algiers during his election campaign, he raised eyebrows by calling colonisation a “crime against humanity”. In 2018 Mr Macron recognised that in 1957 the French state had tortured and executed Maurice Audin, a young communist and nationalist; none of his predecessors had done so. “France”, he declared last year, has “still not resolved the traumas” of its colonial past.</p><p>Mr Stora, author of an official report this year into memories of the war, will run the commission, starting this month. Details are still being worked out. Many of the protagonists and witnesses are dead. Mr Stora says it will involve testimony from descendants, historical work and memorials. Mr Macron has ordered the opening of classified archives relating to the time.</p><p>Over the past half-century more than 50 truth commissions have been set up worldwide. They have become a tool for countries emerging from traumatic periods of history to confront that past, try to break cycles of violence and move on.</p><p>One of the first, in Argentina in 1983, looked into “disappearances” under the military dictatorship. It took evidence from witnesses and produced a bestselling report (“Nunca Más”, or “Never Again”). In 1990 Chile established a commission to look into disappearances and killings under Augusto Pinochet. A second, in 2003, examined torture under his regime. The experience has been mixed, partly because of a fundamental tension between truth and criminal justice, and between the interests of individuals and of a country as a whole. Yet they have not lost favour. Truth commissions are under way in various countries, including Colombia and the Gambia. Britain is considering one to look at the “Troubles” in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Their purpose, according to Priscilla Hayner, author of a global study of them, is primarily “to investigate and report on a pattern of past human-rights abuses”. The template involves a temporary body, set up with a mandate from a government or an international institution, to gather testimony and look at past abuse over a defined period. They aim to establish what happened at a time when official histories may have silenced rival accounts, or those who could tell them. A commission generally ends with a report and recommendations.</p><p>Yet a truth commission is also a form of reckoning. It officially recognises past atrocities. It may also seek to reconcile former adversaries. Some lead to prosecutions. In Chile and Argentina judges used the reports to unpick previous amnesties. In 2017 a court in Argentina sentenced 29 former military officials to life for, among other crimes, kidnapping and drugging civilians, loading them onto planes and dumping them, alive, in the ocean.</p><p>Others are an alternative to retributive justice. South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( trc), set up in 1995, a year after democracy replaced apartheid, could grant amnesty to those who confessed to certain crimes. Dirk Coetzee, a paramilitary commander who confessed to drugging, shooting and burning victims, got it for some of his crimes. “The burning of a body on an open fire takes seven hours,” he told the commission; “Whilst that happened we were drinking and braaiing [barbecuing] next to the fire.”</p><p>And you will know the truth<br>The French commission comes too late to be about amnesty or criminal justice. Yet, even 60 years on, the thirst for answers is surprisingly strong. “It’s absolutely necessary, indispensable,” says Nora Hamadi, a French journalist of Algerian origin. She describes “a form of trauma” among the children and grandchildren of victims, and an “anger against France for the lack of recognition and of respect”.</p><p>Algeria was ruled as part of France from 1830 until its independence. Today, some 7m French residents are linked to this history, as immigrants, former white settlers (pieds-noirs), soldiers (including Algerian harkis, who fought for France) or their families. Faïza Guène, a French novelist of Algerian descent, deplores “the transmission of silence”. “If we don’t talk about this”, she says, “we’ve got no chance of resolving the problem of belonging in France.”</p><p>The subject was long taboo. Not until 1999 did the French government recognise the conflict as a war. Since 2001 political leaders have taken further steps. Nicolas Sarkozy provided Algeria with a map of 11m landmines laid by the French army. François Hollande recognised as a “bloody repression” the massacre of Algerian nationalists in Paris on October 17th 1961.</p><p>Yet many questions remain. “France has been in denial for a very long time,” says Mr Stora. “So it’s complicated. But we need to find a way to hold a conversation, between all the different parties. Everybody is shut away in their own suffering.”</p><p>“Time in itself is not a barrier,” argues Anna Myriam Roccatello of the International Centre for Transitional Justice in New York. Some form of reckoning, even belated, can be helpful. Belgium last year opened a “special commission” into its colonial past in Congo, Rwanda and Burundi.</p><p>More important, suggests Ms Roccatello, is legitimacy and participation. Many point to South Africa’s commission. Chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and endorsed by President Nelson Mandela, the trc began amid great hope. Unlike many commissions in Latin America in the 1980s, victims told their own stories, mostly in public hearings. In two years the trc heard 21,298 witnesses. Amnesty was given only to those who disclosed full details of crimes deemed politically motivated.</p><p>Yet South Africa also reveals the shortcomings of such exercises. The trc ended with rancour. Both former president F.W. de Klerk and Mr Mandela’s African National Congress (anc) tried to obstruct the final report. Mr Mandela had to insist on its publication. Mary Burton, a commissioner and anti-apartheid activist, worried that the trc had facilitated the transition of power rather than helped the victims.</p><p>Moreover, no body was set up to enforce the commission’s recommendations. It took five years for the government to pay reparations to the victims who testified. Some received about a fifth of the money the report recommended. Some 130,000 people entitled to reparations fell foul of a cut-off date for claims. Subsequent anc governments have done little to prosecute perpetrators who did not seek amnesty. Under President Thabo Mbeki 20 people denied amnesty by the trc were pardoned.</p><p>“Our experience in South Africa is that truth does not always lead to reconciliation,” says Annah Moyo-Kupeta of the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation. “People felt they were being forced to forgive.” The trc also served to “de-contextualise” apartheid, argues Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan academic. Apartheid was not just about death squads; it was a legal and economic system, built on colonial foundations. For Mr Mamdani, the trc’s narrow framing made it easier for white South Africans who benefited from apartheid, but were outside the security state, to deny their complicity.</p><p>Yet for all its flaws the trc has been unfairly maligned, argues Mikhail Moosa of the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation in South Africa. He points out that the report’s recommendations were radical—including, for instance, wealth and windfall taxes to tackle the economic legacy of apartheid. It is the fault of anc governments, not the trc, that some apartheid-era criminals got off scot-free, and that South Africa is not better run today.</p><p>Besides, the trc made it impossible for white South Africans to say, “I didn’t know.” They heard four white policemen confess, for example, to beating Steve Biko, leader of the Black Consciousness Movement, chaining him up and leaving his injuries untreated. Biko died after being transported—naked, handcuffed and unconscious—to a prison hospital halfway across the country. The apartheid state said he died of a hunger strike. The trc also gave some, if not all, victims, closure. In 2019 a poll found that 66% of South Africans agreed that it “provided a good foundation for South Africa to achieve reconciliation”.</p><p>Such commissions entail profound trade-offs. Argentina, Chile and Guatemala showed that they can be compatible with prosecutions. But this can be controversial. In El Salvador the promise of a commission helped end civil war. It ran under un auspices in 1992-93 and documented 22,000 complaints in a hard-hitting report, whose impact was blunted by an immediate amnesty. Usually a choice has to be made upfront. Without amnesty, many South Africans would not have learned what happened to their families. Public exposure itself can be a form of punishment.</p><p>Painful choices<br>The interests of those who suffered and society’s must also be balanced. For some individuals, the process revives old traumas. Nomfundo Walaza, who counselled victims during the trc, points out that, if national reconciliation is the aim, “then we have to face the unfortunate reality of a conflict between the interests of victims on one hand and those of the nation as a whole on the other.”</p><p>“Nobody expects a single truth commission to tie up all the issues with a bow,” says Ms Hayner, now a consultant on transitional justice. What matters, she says, is whether it changes “a country’s ability to talk about something”. This is missing in France, where Algeria is the silence underlying so many tensions. “To calm competing memories”, says Rachid Benzine, a French researcher, “France needs to acknowledge it is the inheritor of both the Enlightenment and colonialism.”</p><p>Whatever France does is bound to be criticised, on both sides. The Algerian government may not be satisfied unless France apologises. The French presidency says that will not be necessary. Political expediency may trump historical rigour. Rival memories may be irreconcilable. But to listen to a younger generation in France is to hear a yearning for answers and acknowledgment. “Remembering is not easy,” writes Ms Hayner; “but forgetting may be impossible.”</p><p><a id="business---spacex-a-tesla-for-the-skies"></a></p><h1 id="Business-—SpaceX-a-Tesla-for-the-skies"><a href="#Business-—SpaceX-a-Tesla-for-the-skies" class="headerlink" title="(Business)—SpaceX, a Tesla for the skies"></a>(Business)—SpaceX, a Tesla for the skies</h1><p>Having revolutionised the rocket business, SpaceX takes aim at telecoms</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>What goes up must come down. That was certainly true of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency enthusiastically endorsed by Elon Musk which surged in value in February after Tesla added $1.5bn-worth to its balance sheet. It plunged on May 12th after the carmaker stopped customers using bitcoin to buy its vehicles. Mr Musk worries about the use of fossil fuels to “mine” the cryptocurrency. More gracefully, on May 5th a prototype version of SpaceX’s massive “Starship” rocket—designed to be the biggest since the Saturn V that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon—rose 10km above Boca Chica in Texas, before flying itself back to its launchpad and landing gently on the ground. It was not Starship’s first high-altitude test flight. But it was the first that had ended without a fireball.</p><p>It was the latest piece of good news for SpaceX, a rocketry firm founded in 2002 by Mr Musk, who is perhaps better known as the chief executive of Tesla, an electric-car pioneer. Like Tesla, SpaceX has taken an unloved technology and made drastic improvements, shaking up a complacent industry. While Tesla’s mission—“accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy”—is grand, SpaceX’s is even grander. Mr Musk wants to use its cheap rockets to make humanity a “multi-planetary space-faring civilisation” by establishing a colony on Mars. And like Tesla, SpaceX’s valuation has soared. According to PitchBook, a data-analysis firm, SpaceX’s latest funding round, completed in April, valued it at $74bn, up from $46bn in August 2020. cb Insights, a firm of analysts, ranks SpaceX the third-most-valuable startup in the world (see chart).</p><p>Big rocket man<br>It may seem odd to describe a 19-year-old firm as a “startup”. But most of SpaceX’s swelling valuation comes not from the business it already does but, again like Tesla, its investors’ hopes for its future. To pay for its Martian ambitions, SpaceX plans to transform itself into a globe-straddling telecoms giant. It hopes to repeat Mr Musk’s signature trick of making big improvements to existing technologies. Its Starlink service, currently open to testers in countries including America, Britain and Germany, is building the biggest satellite network ever, in order to beam fast internet access to every corner of the planet.</p><p>SpaceX’s advances in rocketry provide the launchpad. Its craft are unusual in that they are reusable, rather than disposable. After launch, the first stage of its Falcon 9 can fly itself back to Earth; and after a refurbishment lasting a few weeks, it can fly again. Along with a focus on cost-cutting and a willingness to experiment and take risks, that has allowed SpaceX to undercut its competitors drastically.</p><p>As with Tesla, complacent incumbents have been trying to respond. United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, two aerospace giants, has cut jobs and trimmed costs. In November Tory Bruno, its boss, said prices for its Atlas V rocket were down from $225m per launch to just over $100m. Arianespace, a European firm, has also cut prices for its Ariane 5, which is thought to cost around €175m ($213m) per flight. It hopes the Ariane 6, due to make its first flight next year, will be 40% cheaper than its predecessor. SpaceX charges $62m for a fresh rocket, or $50m for a used one.</p><p>Low prices, a focus on cost control, and a willingness to take risks and iterate rapidly (another signature Musk trait) have helped SpaceX win contracts with everyone from Iridium and Intelsat, established satellite firms, to startups such as Planet and governments, including those of America, Germany and South Korea. On April 16th nasa awarded SpaceX $2.9bn to develop a lunar lander as part of America’s plan to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024 (though the contract was suspended on April 30th, while a government agency reviews rival firms’ complaints). On September 15th it plans to fly four tourists on a three-day orbital jolly. Morgan Stanley, a bank, describes SpaceX as “mission control” for the fast-growing “emerging space” sector—which, estimates Seraphim Capital, a venture-capital company, attracted $8.7bn of venture investment in the year to March, up by 95% from the year before.</p><p>And it is not standing still. Starship has a carrying capacity more than six times that of the Falcon 9. Despite its vast size, it is fully reusable, and is intended to be far cheaper than SpaceX’s current rockets. Mr Musk hopes Starship could end up costing less than $2m per launch.</p><p>However nifty SpaceX’s technology gets, the launch market, at around $6bn in 2019, is relatively small, says Simon Potter of BryceTech, a firm of analysts and engineers. Many players are shielded from full competition by governments worried about national security. That will limit SpaceX’s market share. Instead, says Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, SpaceX sees launch as an “enabling technology” for its other plans. The firm’s next target is the telecoms business. Starlink aims to provide internet access worldwide, including places where other forms of connectivity are poor or non-existent.</p><p>This is a much bigger market, at least on paper. The International Telecommunication Union, a un agency, reckons 48% of the world’s population was offline in 2019. Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said in 2019 that the worldwide internet-access market was worth perhaps $1trn a year. SpaceX, Mr Musk has said, might aim to capture around 3% of that. Even that sliver would have brought in $30bn two years ago.</p><p>Tomorrow the stars<br>Satellite internet is not a new idea. But it is another technology that Mr Musk thinks he can improve. Existing internet satellites fly at high altitude, to maximise coverage. The drawback is that many customers must share a single satellite, limiting capacity. And the time taken for radio signals to travel to high-flying satellites adds unavoidable, and irritating, delays. At the moment satellite internet is usually a last-resort option when nothing better is available—in remote rural areas or on ships at sea, for instance.</p><p>Starlink hopes to fix those problems by using its cheap rockets to put thousands of small, cheap satellites in low orbits. In the first quarter of 2021, SpaceX launched more objects, measured by mass, into orbit than every other rocket operator combined, says Mr Potter. Starlink’s 1,500-odd existing satellites already account for around a quarter of all those in orbit. SpaceX has firm plans for over 10,000 more, and has filed paperwork for up to 42,000—more than four times as many satellites as have been launched since the start of the space age.</p><p>The prototype service is undergoing testing by thousands of people. Most seem pleased, reporting fast and responsive connections. But the satellite-internet business has a poor record. Iridium went bankrupt in 1999, the year after its launch (it was eventually bailed out by the American government). Intelsat and Speedcast, two established companies, filed for bankruptcy last year, as did OneWeb, a startup with a similar business model to Starlink’s. Intelsat is currently restructuring and Speedcast is doing business again under new owners. But the fragility of the business makes assigning a future value to SpaceX tricky. Morgan Stanley’s attempt spans two orders of magnitude, from $5bn to $200bn, with different assumptions about the viability of Starlink accounting for almost all the difference.</p><p>Even with low launch costs, at least two big challenges remain, says Rasmus Flytkjaer of LondonEconomist image repository Economics, a consultancy. One is that most of Starlink’s potential customers are people ill-served by terrestrial internet firms. They tend to live in relatively poor rural areas. Starlink’s price of $99 per month is not cheap even for rich-country users. The other is the cost of the high-tech satellite dishes needed to make the system work: 23-inch antennas that attach to roofs or walls. Since Starlink’s satellites are in low orbits, they zip quickly across the sky. The aerials must be able to track satellites as they move, and switch seamlessly from one to the next as they disappear below the horizon.</p><p>Ms Shotwell said in April that the dishes, which SpaceX sells for $499, cost around $1,500 to produce, down from about $3,000 two years ago. SpaceX hopes that economies of scale will eventually drive manufacturing costs down to “a few hundred dollars”. Part of Iridium’s problem, says Mr Flytkjaer, was meeting the capital cost of building up its network before it could attract paying customers. Mr Musk’s deep pockets, he says, should mean SpaceX is less likely to run out of cash than its predecessor two decades ago.</p><p>Such challenges may explain Mr Musk’s uncharacteristic lack of bombast when talking about Starlink. Tesla sells cars with features like “Ludicrous Mode” and “Bioweapon Defence Mode”. Starlink, by contrast, calls its public-test programme the “Better Than Nothing Beta Test”. At a space conference last year Mr Musk said Starlink’s goal, for now, was simply not to go bankrupt. He has repeatedly tried to assure existing telecoms firms that Starlink is not a threat, pointing out that the service is ill-suited to serving large numbers of customers in densely populated cities.</p><p>Starlink’s test programme is currently available in only a handful of rich countries. Yet the firm said on May 5th that it had collected half a million pre-orders. It has requested regulatory permission for up to 5m users in America alone. In December SpaceX won $886m from America’s government to provide broadband in rural areas; it is said to be in similar talks in Britain. Not all governments will be as accommodating, since the internet access offered by Starlink could prove tricky for the authorities to censor.</p><p>In poorer countries, says Mr Flytkjaer, Starlink’s satellites could connect rural mobile-phone masts to the internet, spreading the cost among many users. SpaceX is running tests with America’s armed forces, which like the idea of having internet connectivity on any battlefield. In 2019 the firm showed its ability to provide high-speed, in-flight internet to a military jet.</p><p>Mr Musk is not the only billionaire who thinks satellite internet is an idea whose time has come, despite its unpromising history. After its bankruptcy OneWeb was rescued by the British government and Bharti Enterprises, an Indian conglomerate whose founder, Sunil Mittal, is one of India’s wealthiest men. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, is every bit as rich as Mr Musk—and just as much of a space cadet, bankrolling Blue Origin, his own private rocket firm. Amazon itself is planning a low-flying satellite-internet similar to Starlink, called Kuiper. The car industry increasingly dances to Mr Musk’s tune. The space industry is going the same way. </p><p><a id="how-executive-mothers-cope"></a></p><h1 id="How-executive-mothers-cope"><a href="#How-executive-mothers-cope" class="headerlink" title="How executive mothers cope"></a>How executive mothers cope</h1><p>Women still face barriers to progress at work</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Betsy holden was vice-president of strategy and new products at Kraft, a giant food company, when she became pregnant for the second time. “No one has ever done the job with two children,” her male boss worried. “How many children do you have?” Ms Holden asked. “Two,” he replied.</p><p>This double standard is only one of the barriers that female executives face, as recounted in “Power Moms”, a new book by Joann Lublin, a former Wall Street Journal columnist. The author focuses on two waves of female leaders. The first group were the baby-boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. These were often the only women in upper management at their firms. They faced a lot of pressure to be hands-on mothers, had little support from their husbands and were reluctant to ask for reduced schedules for fear of not seeming committed to their jobs. The stress for these women was immense, especially as they felt unable to discuss their parenting problems with male colleagues.</p><p>The second wave of women, born between 1974 and 1985, had female colleagues in upper management, expected (and usually received) support from their spouses, and benefited from employer perks, such as maternity leave and flexible working. They were able to be more open with colleagues about their parental duties. This later generation has mastered the “work-life sway” in which they move back and forth between their personal and professional lives in the course of a day, conducting a meeting before taking their children for a check-up and then returning to the office.</p><p>The earlier generation, by blazing the trail, made it easier for those behind them. A Harvard Business School study shows that adult daughters of employed mothers are more likely to hold supervisory responsibility and earn higher incomes while sons are likely to spend more time caring for family members. And companies are now much more willing to promote women, who make up more than a fifth of senior executive positions in American firms, compared with just 10% in 1996. A few are exceptionally accommodating, for example providing rooms where mothers can express milk, sinks to wash the breast pump and even courier services to deliver the milk when they are away on a business trip.</p><p>But there is still a long way to go. Only 27% of American employers offered paid parental leave in 2019. That may be up from 17% in 2016, but still leaves a lot of mothers uncovered. Even where leave is available, many women don’t take full advantage. A survey of female tech-industry employees in 2018 found that 44% of women who had taken maternity leave had taken off less time than their entitlement because they thought a longer break would damage their careers.</p><p>Working mothers are still overloaded. Mothers who are employed full-time spend nearly two-thirds more of their day feeding, bathing and caring for their children (under six) than their employed husbands do. They still struggle with guilt. One executive was on the phone with an important client in her locked office, only for an impatient toddler to bang on the door and repeatedly scream, “You don’t love me.” Unsurprisingly, a study found that chronic stress levels are 40% higher in women who are employed and bringing up two children than in childless working women. Worse still, female employees routinely toiling more than 60 hours a week were more than three times as likely to develop heart disease, cancer or diabetes than those on a conventional 40-hour schedule.</p><p>Despite the advances made by female executives, things are even more difficult for the vast majority of working mothers. Many work in smaller businesses, where maternity benefits and flexible hours are less likely to be available. Many are in low-paid jobs, or in sectors like health care and retailing, where it has been impossible to work remotely during the pandemic. The author writes that “nothing is more essential to an employed mother’s professional success than reliable high-quality child care”, and for many women who are not executives, this is a constant headache.</p><p>It is good news that many more women have climbed the corporate ladder, not just in terms of fairness, but because an economy should take advantage of all its potential talent. There needs to be a lot more progress made in helping the vast majority of women to juggle their home and work lives, not least by providing affordable child care. There are many more cleaners, cooks and carers than there are chief executives.</p><p><a id="are-drug-patents-worth-it"></a></p><h1 id="Are-drug-patents-worth-it"><a href="#Are-drug-patents-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Are drug patents worth it?"></a>Are drug patents worth it?</h1><p>Politicians are attacking IP protection, but shareholders are Big Pharma’s bigger headache</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>One of the first rules of American politics is not to pick a fight with Big Pharma. Its army of lobbyists in Washington, dc, has ensured that presidents from both parties, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, have upheld the industry’s stout defence of intellectual-property (ip) rights, including in international treaties. Donald Trump threatened to impose drug price controls, which won bipartisan support in Congress, but intense lobbying ensured that his initiative flopped. That effort to rein in Big Pharma chimed with the industry’s global image as arrogant and greedy.</p><p>President Joe Biden is throwing his weight behind a proposal at the World Trade Organisation to waive patent protections for covid-19 vaccines. If Mr Biden is willing to rethink ip rights for covid vaccines abroad, he might also have the audacity to take on patent protection for new drugs at home. To judge whether America’s industry deserves such treatment, it is worth asking three questions. First, how much innovation is happening? Second, is rent-seeking behaviour—ranging from price gouging to patent manipulation—declining? Third, what might happen if patent rules were watered down?</p><p>Start with innovation. In the 2000s pharma investment fell out of fashion. But since 2010 America’s industry has raised spending on research and development (r&amp;d) sharply as a share of revenues, to over 25% (see chart). Venture funding into life sciences in America is booming, hitting a record high of $36bn in 2020, double the level in 2017. The number of new drugs approved by America’s Food and Drug Administration has more than doubled in the past decade. None of these measures is an ideal proxy for future innovation, but they suggest the mood has changed.</p><p>On rent-seeking, too, the picture is less dire that it was. Drug prices in America are still the world’s highest on average, but the rate of increase has slowed. According to iqvia, a data firm, once secret rebates offered to big customers are discounted, net drug prices rose more slowly than inflation in 2018 and 2019. Political pressure is only one reason. Consolidation among health insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers (big middlemen) who pay for drugs gave them more power to negotiate price cuts. It has got harder to mint cash from blockbuster drugs. Deloitte, a consultancy, reckons that the internal rate of return on in-house r&amp;d at a dozen big drugs firms fell from 10% a decade ago to 2% in 2019—below their weighted-average cost of capital of 7%. The average cost to bring a drug to market has increased by two-thirds since 2010, to some $2bn. And the forecast for peak sales for each new drug has also fallen by half over that period. Often big firms prefer to buy smaller innovative rivals. According to ey, a consultancy, American drugs firms spent $185bn in the past five years on biotech acquisitions. Roughly a third of revenues at big drugs firms are the result of ip arising from acquisitions.</p><p>What would happen if patent rules were weakened? Rent-seeking would fall, but innovation might, too. One way of getting a sense of this is to look at how much innovation happens outside America, where ip rights are often weaker or less well enforced. In most industries innovation is now happening globally, not just in America, but in pharma it still has a powerful American skew. Two-thirds of worldwide biotech venture-capital investment takes place there. Despite China’s advances on other fronts, in life sciences it still accounts for only about 15% of the global total of venture-capital funding. Similarly, even as American multinational pharma firms have become more global (earning roughly half their revenues abroad), their preference for domestic r&amp;d has risen, with 88% of it done in America.</p><p>This suggests that America’s government will eschew wholesale changes that damage innovation. But it still might loosen the patent regime to reduce rent-seeking from old drugs. In 2019 the Federal Trade Commission, a regulator, found that the industry is relying less than it used to on egregious “pay for delay” agreements, through which it paid generics firms to hold off on launching low-cost rivals to pricey drugs coming off patent. However, Big Pharma is still using other wheezes, such as “evergreening” ip protection beyond the initial 20-year period by filing a thicket of patents on minor modifications. More can be done to rein in such abuses.</p><p>The s&amp;p index of big drugs firms has risen by roughly 20% over the past five years while the broader equity market has doubled. Despite miraculous covid-19 treatments, this year the pharma index has declined by nearly a tenth. It is clear that even as spending on innovation rises, presumably reflecting confidence that important ip rights in America will remain intact, investors think the opportunity to print easy money is not as good as it was. That seems about right.</p><p><a id="will-shareholders-halt-the-inexorable-rise-of-ceo-pay"></a></p><h1 id="Will-shareholders-halt-the-inexorable-rise-of-CEO-pay"><a href="#Will-shareholders-halt-the-inexorable-rise-of-CEO-pay" class="headerlink" title="Will shareholders halt the inexorable rise of CEO pay?"></a>Will shareholders halt the inexorable rise of CEO pay?</h1><p>During the pandemic, bosses found new ways to feather their nests</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Last year was a terrible one for travel of any sort. You would not know it from the way some American chief executives trousered pay. Annual filings show that Larry Culp, boss of ge, whose jet-engine business stalled as aviation nosedived, earned $73m, almost triple his total pay in 2019. Christopher Nassetta, ceo of Hilton, a hotel chain, enjoyed a 161% pay boost, receiving $55.9m. Norwegian Cruise Line, which described 2020 as the hardest year in its history, more than doubled the compensation of its ceo, Frank Del Rio, to $36.4m. All three were among the corporate titans who grandly took cuts in their basic pay and/or bonuses during the pandemic. They pocketed far more than they gave up.</p><p>They did so thanks to a nifty conjuring trick performed in boardrooms across America last year. In effect, many boards airbrushed away the impact of covid-19 on performance-based pay either by removing a quarter or two of bad numbers in order to meet bonus targets, changing the metrics mid-course, or—as with Messrs Culp, Nassetta and Del Rio—by issuing new share grants after the pandemic gutted the previous ones. (Mr Culp and Mr Del Rio also got contract extensions.)</p><p>The result was a continuation of the inexorable rise of ceo pay in America during a year that, for mere mortals, was one of massive job losses, furloughing and government support. According to MyLogiq, a data gatherer, the median pay of nearly 450 ceos running firms in the s&amp;p 500 that have reported so far was $13.2m last year, an increase for the fifth year running. It said Mr Nassetta and Mr Del Rio were among two dozen bosses in that group who got a pay rise even though their firms lost money.</p><p>So now comes the backlash from investors, right? So far this year, shareholders have used “say-on-pay” votes at annual general meetings to censure an unusually large number of America’s biggest firms for gerrymandering pay policies, including ge, at&amp;t, a telecoms giant, ibm, a tech firm, and Walgreens Boots Alliance, a pharmacy business. Pay consultants report that those ceos yet to face combative shareholder meetings are “sweating it”. That is no bad thing if it suggests that institutions are so fed up with the stratospheric rewards on offer that they convince boards to put an end to them. But don’t bet on it. Shareholders remain in as much of a muddle over high pay as company directors.</p><p>To be fair, it’s a tricky issue. There is a widely held view in America that executive pay, like the stockmarket, always rises. That’s not strictly accurate. During the second world war pay fell, and for 30 years after barely budged. But since then, ceo pay inflation has been a fairly reliable assumption: the average level has risen about tenfold since the mid-1970s, vastly outpacing the income of average workers.</p><p>It is a phenomenon that extends well beyond chief executives. Superstars from J.K. Rowling, an author, to Cristiano Ronaldo, a footballer, also earn spectacularly more than their counterparts would have done in ages past, notes Alex Edmans of the London Business School. In such a competitive global market, high pay may be justified to recruit and keep the best people. Yet its merits are undermined when bosses reap the windfalls from extraordinarily good times, such as a stockmarket boom, but are spared the consequences of misfortune, such as a pandemic. As Mr Edmans puts it: “If you’re letting ceos benefit from the upside, they have to feel the pain on the downside.” Boards tend to ignore that. Perhaps they, too, gain from perpetuating a system that keeps their own salaries high. For whatever reason, they threw around the painkillers last year like smarties.</p><p>Pliant boards are not the only problem. Pusillanimous investors are part of it, too. Until the pandemic, the average vote supporting management on say-on-pay proposals was 90% or more, says Semler Brossy, a pay consultancy. That’s a whopping approval rate. By contrast, Cal pers, America’s most outspoken public-pension fund, in 2019 and 2020 voted against more than half of them, usually because the rises were not justified by mediocre market performance. Things appear to be changing. MyLog iq says that the share of companies in the s&amp; p 500 that have failed say-on-pay votes so far this year is running at 6.1%, almost three times the level for the whole of 2019. Institutions claim that the issue has become more pressing because the “heads-I-win, tails-you-lose” approach to pay screams inequality. Yet their protest votes on pay remain relatively few, they are non-binding, and the number of pay recalibrations last year were unusually high, suggesting their fury on the issue may yet cool. Say-on-pay censure alone will not end America’s fat-cat era.</p><p>It is hard to imagine what will. Many shareholders instinctively cringe at the thought of taxation and pay caps, an option floated by left-wing Democrats. Yet their own collective efforts to modify the system are also feeble. Calls to lengthen the period executives hold shares to, say, five or ten years have so far gone nowhere. Efforts to stop boards benchmarking ceos against lavishly paid members of peer-group companies have also flopped.</p><p>Doing well by doing good<br>It is quite likely, in fact, that shareholders will focus less on pay in coming years as they prioritise even more emotive issues, such as gender and racial diversity among firms they invest in, as well as climate change. By 2022 environmental, social and governance (esg) goals are expected to be part of many more ceo pay schemes, especially as the credo grows of maximising value not just for shareholders, but for stakeholders. In the long term, these may help improve stockmarket returns. But in the short run the risk is that, while oversight is lax, some boards will use esg criteria to distract attention from poor financial performance. One day the world may have cause to cheer the impact of a greater focus on sustainability. But in the meantime some ceos will no doubt use it as a new way of feathering their own nests. </p>]]></content>

For members of the Bunun tribe, a community of indigenous people who live among the island’s mountains, flatulence and sneezing are bad omens (in addition to scaring off prey). Male deer are fair game, but females, who might be pregnant, are left in peace. Talum Suqluman followed these strictures in the summer of 2013, when he climbed into the hills of Taitung County, on the south-east coast, and shot two deer, a Formosan serow and a Reeve’s muntjac. They would provide a good store of meat for his ageing mother, with plenty left over to share with his village.</p><p>There are some written rules, too. Mr Suqluman was arrested and charged with possession of an illegal firearm and for violating the Wildlife Conservation Act. He was sentenced to more than three years in jail (although appeals have ensured that he has yet to spend any time behind bars). Indigenous communities were outraged at the sentence, which they viewed as unduly harsh. Moreover, they were angry that their traditional hunting practices are prohibited at all.</p><p>In early May Taiwan’s highest court ruled that while some of the rules around hunting are unconstitutional, because they breach indigenous people’s rights to practice their culture freely, animals also need to be protected. Hunting restrictions will mostly remain in place. The verdict is “far from satisfactory”, says Awi Mona of National Dong Hwa University, the first indigenous person in Taiwan to obtain a doctorate in law.</p><p>Taiwan’s tribes have lived on the island for some 6,000 years, but only started to receive official recognition in 2001. They are more closely related ethnically to Filipinos than to the island’s Chinese majority, who are descended from settlers who began arriving in large numbers in the 17th century. Today the 16 officially recognised tribes make up 2.5% of the population. Around half of indigenous people live in the countryside, where hunting is central to their way of life. The conservation law, which states that hunting can be done only on certain days and that hunters must apply for a permit indicating which animals they are planning to kill, is routinely ignored. Indigenous hunters also complain about the rule that they must use only traditional, home-made guns. These require gunpowder and ammunition to be loaded from the front end of the barrel, like a musket, making them more dangerous than modern weapons.</p><p>Just like the guns they are forced to use, many indigenous people feel they themselves are viewed as primitive. Savungaz Valincinan, from the Bunun tribe, complains that ethnic-Chinese people ask her things like, “Can you ride a mountain pig?” It is not just bad attitudes that people are upset about. Aboriginal life expectancy is 8.6 years lower than that of the general population.</p><p>In 2016 Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, promised to improve the lot of indigenous people and apologised for centuries of “pain and unfair treatment”. But prohibiting hunting will “wipe out” their culture, said Mr Suqluman, in a statement after last week’s verdict. Regardless of the law, he says that “of course” he will continue to hunt.</p><p><a id="south-korea-is-pushing-america-for-new-talks-with-the-north"></a></p><h1 id="South-Korea-is-pushing-America-for-new-talks-with-the-North"><a href="#South-Korea-is-pushing-America-for-new-talks-with-the-North" class="headerlink" title="South Korea is pushing America for new talks with the North"></a>South Korea is pushing America for new talks with the North</h1><p>The 70-year stalemate between the two Koreas is unlikely to break without fresh diplomacy</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>To the casual reader, the biggest danger in perusing “With the Century” may be the book’s propensity to induce a deep sleep. Its author, Kim Il Sung, North Korea’s founding dictator, takes eight volumes and nearly 3,500 pages to recount his heroic revolutionary exploits. Whether the topic is glorious campaigns against the Japanese, earnest conversations with brave peasants, or long-winded meditations on the true meaning of juche (self-reliance), the message is, “You had to be there”.</p><p>But that is not how Do Tae-woo, a lawyer for various right-wing groups, saw it when he filed an injunction last month against a South Korean publisher who produced a new edition of the memoir in the South. Publishing the book, Mr Do argued, was “the ultimate act of treason”.</p><p>South Korean law agrees. Under the national security act, enforced with minor changes since 1948, distributing material favourable to the regime in the North is punishable with up to seven years in prison. The South’s government blocks access to North Korean state media (except on the website of its own semi-official news agency, which publishes daily excerpts). When Mr Do sued, police began investigating the publisher that put out the memoir. Bookshops stopped selling it.</p><p>Though the law is no longer enforced with the same enthusiasm as in South Korea’s undemocratic past, its longevity is a reminder that the fundamental relationship between the two Koreas has changed remarkably little in the past 70 years. On paper, they are still at war, each considering itself the legitimate government of the other’s people and territory. Short of one side invading—a strategy that North Korea attempted with disappointing results in 1950—or North Korea collapsing, a fate that pundits have been predicting with a similar lack of success for decades, talking is still the only viable way improve things.</p><p>Precious little of that has been happening of late. The latest round of diplomacy, intended to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear weapons, fell apart at a summit between Kim Jong Un, the North’s dictator, and Donald Trump, then America’s president, more than two years ago in Vietnam. Last summer North Korea blew up the South’s de facto embassy in the border city of Kaesong, laying waste to a symbol of the detente that began in early 2018. The North has since resumed testing missiles and has increased the ferocity of its denunciations of South Korea and America.</p><p>Moon Jae-in, the South’s president, who is nearing the end of his term, lamented this on May 10th and vowed to make a last-ditch effort to improve things. “It is the aspiration of 80m Koreans to end the era of confrontation and conflict on the Korean peninsula and usher in an era of peace and prosperity,” he said. He promised to try in his last year in office to move from “an incomplete peace” to “an irreversible one”.</p><p>Improving relations with the North has been at the centre of Mr Moon’s presidency. But that goal remains elusive. The failure of the summit meeting with Mr Trump in Vietnam humiliated Mr Kim, who sacked most of his negotiators afterwards. He has made clear he has little interest in talking to the South without new concessions from America, which Mr Kim sees as his main adversary and negotiating partner. When the covid-19 pandemic began, he closed the border, cutting the North off even from China, its main trading partner. The lockdown appears to have hurt the North’s economy more than the international sanctions that were intended to persuade Mr Kim to abandon his nukes. The North still harangues the South about its failure to rein in defectors who send leaflets and money across the border. The rhetoric of Mr Kim’s regime is ever more paranoid. Its people are warned that “flying objects” (such as leaflets), packaging or even snow may carry the virus.</p><p>Mr Moon is meeting Joe Biden, his American counterpart, on May 21st. He hopes to persuade him to join a fresh attempt to break the impasse. Last month the Biden administration announced a new “calibrated, practical approach” to diplomacy with the North, without giving details. But it said nothing to irritate Mr Kim, who may have been pleased that America embraced the North’s talk of “the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” rather than referring only to North Korea. Rumours this week in Seoul, the South’s capital, hinted that the North may have responded positively to the possibility of further talks with America.</p><p>But the Koreas are probably quite low on Mr Biden’s agenda, as he faces foreign-policy crises on a variety of other fronts. He has yet to appoint a successor to Stephen Biegun, Mr Trump’s point man on North Korea, leaving no obvious interlocutor if the North indeed wants to talk. Unless it is fleshed out in the next few weeks, America’s new policy will be hard to distinguish from Barack Obama’s “strategic patience”, says Sung Ki-young of the Institute for National Security Studies, a government-affiliated think-tank in Seoul.</p><p>Other stumbling blocks may also impede talks. South Korean officials say they were happy to have been consulted on America’s new policy. But some of their attempts to mollify the North sit awkwardly with Mr Biden’s priorities. Police in Seoul this week interrogated Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector who sent leaflets northwards last month, defying a new law. He could face up to three years in prison. In the same speech in which Mr Moon promised a push for peace, he also alluded to Mr Park’s case, stressing that his government had “no choice” but to enforce the law. Mr Biden’s people say they intend to pay more attention to human rights when talking to North Korea, presumably including those of Northerners in the South. Mr Moon will be hoping that when he goes to Washington next week, Mr Park’s fate gets less airtime than the exploits of Mr Kim. </p><p><a id="india%E2%80%99s-covid-19-crisis-is-devastating-its-most-desperate-people"></a></p><h1 id="India’s-covid-19-crisis-is-devastating-its-most-desperate-people"><a href="#India’s-covid-19-crisis-is-devastating-its-most-desperate-people" class="headerlink" title="India’s covid-19 crisis is devastating its most desperate people"></a>India’s covid-19 crisis is devastating its most desperate people</h1><p>The poor are losing jobs, going hungry and falling victim to scams</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Pye dogs and circling scavengers gave the first clue. When villagers approached the riverbank, the stench confirmed the horror. By the time authorities collected and buried all the bodies on May 11th, the count had risen to 71. And this was at just one bend in the sacred Ganges, by the village of Chausa on the border between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India’s poorest, most underdeveloped states. In the same week at least three other grisly human logjams were reported upstream.</p><p>These sad scenes reveal two things. One is the scale of the tragedy now sweeping India’s vast interior. Far away from city labs, no one gets tested, so no cases are recorded, so no deaths are captured in the official national toll, which at 258,000 is a small fraction of the real tally.</p><p>The second thing the bodies in the Ganges reveal is how India’s second wave is worsening the already harsh lot of its poor. “People borrow money to pay for medicines, or for oxygen, or for an ambulance driver who has charged them extra covid rates,” explains Utpal Pathak, a local journalist. “Then they can’t afford the funeral.” In recent weeks, say residents of Chausa, the cost of a cremation has tripled. It is telling that the authorities, despite denying that poverty has anything to do with the scandal, have started supplying free wood to the funeral ghats of Chausa. Bihar has also capped the price of ambulances.</p><p>After the first covid-19 wave swept India last year, numerous reports tried to tally the cost to the poor. Pew, a research institute, estimates that whereas just 4.3% of Indians were earning less than $2 a day in January 2020, a year later this had risen to 9.7%, or 134m people. An in-depth study by Azim Premji University in Bangalore suggests that in the wake of last year’s nationwide lockdown, some 230m Indians slipped below a poverty threshold tied to the national minimum wage (around $45 a month). Its researchers found that, during the lockdown, 90% of the poor consumed less food. Six months later, their diets had not returned to normal. Over the course of the year the earnings of Indian workers, including the lucky 10% who hold salaried jobs, declined by a third.</p><p>Shocked by the pain it caused last year, the central government has left state and local governments to impose their own lockdowns during this wave. But though the economy has not come to a complete standstill, the sheer scale of the outbreak means lots of families have suffered just as much. For many, the biggest blow has been the loss of breadwinners. Indian Railways, which employs 1.2m people, says covid has killed 1,952 of its staff. The state of Uttar Pradesh in April put 1.2m civil servants to work running local elections and counting ballots. The vote was a super-spreader and an estimated 2,000 of these workers subsequently died, including 800 schoolteachers. Each of those deaths represented weeks of trauma and expense for the families seeking treatment and, for every person that died, perhaps another 20 were seriously ill.</p><p>With government spending on health stuck at a meagre 1.2% of gdp, in ordinary times Indians pay out of their own pockets for some 60% of health-care costs (see chart ). And in an ordinary year one in every 20 families is pushed into poverty by medical expenses. The past two months have been anything but ordinary. Millions of desperate Indian families have been forced to sell gold, to pawn possessions or to borrow at usurious rates, all too often in order to pay for unnecessary treatments prescribed by harried doctors, or to provide basic items lacking in government hospitals, from oxygen tanks to syringes. The variety of traps they have fallen into seems endless: medical staff demanding bribes to secure hospital admission, suppliers of fake medicines, and even, in several states, conmen who have painted over fire extinguishers to sell as oxygen cylinders.</p><p>In Delhi, India’s capital, police have set up a special unit to fight such scams. Mostly, however, the government is notable by its absence. Harsh Vardhan, the health minister, who has promoted herbal covid “cures”, last week advised Indians to eat extra-dark chocolate with “more than 70% cocoa” in order to beat covid-related stress. Perhaps he should read a recent World Bank report, which shows that 86% of Indian families cannot afford a basic balanced diet, let alone fancy chocolate. </p><p><a id="china---china%E2%80%99s-football-troubles-reflect-broader-issues-within-the-economy"></a></p><h1 id="China-—China’s-football-troubles-reflect-broader-issues-within-the-economy"><a href="#China-—China’s-football-troubles-reflect-broader-issues-within-the-economy" class="headerlink" title="(China)—China’s football troubles reflect broader issues within the economy"></a>(China)—China’s football troubles reflect broader issues within the economy</h1><p>Slow growth and politics take their toll</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It was a hot and sticky night for football. Because of covid-19 restrictions, the match was played at a neutral site, nearly three hours from Shanghai by car. Adding to the inconvenience, kick-off was at 6pm on a Monday. Yet a few thousand supporters still made the trek on May 10th to watch their beloved local side, Shenhua, battle the club from Hebei, a northern province. “It’s a kind of faith for us,” said A.G. Wan, a middle-aged businessman.</p><p>Cries of sha bi, a phrase not translatable in a family newspaper, rang out whenever the referee missed fouls that, for the fans, were plain to see. Cheers erupted when a Shenhua midfielder scored the equaliser with a perfectly struck last-minute penalty kick. The crowd’s passion would have been familiar to football fans anywhere. But the canvas on which it was painted—a league beset by financial chicanery and political meddling—was unmistakably Chinese.</p><p>China can seem like an economic juggernaut. Leaders set lofty targets and funnel money to favoured industries, a potent recipe when combined with talented, driven people. Football shows a less flattering side of its system: how the top-down approach that has worked well to build bullet trains can fail in less predictable domains.</p><p>The government has high ambitions for football, encapsulated by President Xi Jinping’s stated dream for China to win the World Cup some day. That day remains distant. The national team is ranked 77th in the world, behind tiny Curaçao. And domestic leagues, a crucial building block, are mired in mediocrity.</p><p>To understand what has gone wrong, look at the Chinese Super League (csl), the country’s main football contest. Three months after winning its first-ever csl title, Jiangsu Suning disbanded in February, tripped up by slowing growth and a more conservative political environment. The team’s owner, Suning, an electronics retailer, has been trying to pay down its debts, like other overstretched Chinese firms. Not long ago a football champion would have attracted buyers, even if bleeding cash. These days, though, few tycoons dare to acquire trophy assets. In all, more than 20 teams have left China’s professional leagues in the past two years.</p><p>The economics of football in China are atrocious. Average annual salaries for players of $1.2m in 2019 put the csl roughly in line with Ligue 1, France’s top division. But revenues in China are piddling, with tickets regularly costing as little as 50 yuan ($8). Guangzhou Evergrande, a club renowned for its profligacy, took in only a third of the 2.9bn yuan ($450m) that it spent in 2019.</p><p>Moreover, most wages go to a few extremely expensive players, often imported from abroad, sometimes well past their prime. Carlos Tevez, a faded Argentinian star, described his spell with Shenhua in 2017 as a “vacation for seven months”, despite reportedly earning $40m. In the 1990s foreign clubs rarely gave their Chinese counterparts the time of day, says Joseph Lee, a powerful agent. Now, he says, they view China as “stupid” money.</p><p>Why have teams burnt cash with such gusto? Partly it is about branding. Xu Jiayin, the billionaire behind Evergrande, a property developer, once said that owning a football club ensured that his company made the evening news at a fraction of the cost of advertisements. But China’s tycoons are not just targeting consumers. They see Mr Xi’s professed love for football as a way to connect with him. After he rose to power in 2012, Chinese money poured into starry European clubs, from Inter Milan to Manchester City.</p><p>The past year has made clear that, far from appreciating their investments in football, Mr Xi and his advisers see them as a red flag. Companies including Fosun, Wanda, cefc, teda and Guangzhou r&amp;f were among the big spenders, and all have had their finances come under scrutiny. There is talk that some entrepreneurs overpaid for players or for clubs in order to skirt China’s stringent capital controls (the suggestion was that they had kickbacks paid into their accounts abroad).</p><p>So the government has introduced tough new rules, a crackdown that parallels Mr Xi’s efforts to reassert control over the broader economy. Politically, there has been a push to induct more footballers into the Communist Party, much as private companies are pressed to set up party branches. And the Chinese Football Association has capped salaries at 5m yuan for Chinese players and €3m for foreigners. It also ordered clubs to drop corporate titles from their names. Guangzhou Evergrande has become Guangzhou.</p><p>Ma Dexing, a football columnist, sees the restraints as progress. “Over the past 30 years professional football in China has been chaotic,” he says. Mr Lee thinks the changes have been rash. “It’s like half the building was good and the other half rotten, but they demolished it all,” he says.</p><p>The new rules also display officials’ penchant for micro-management. In 2017, to boost youth development, the football association required clubs to field an under-23 player for every match. Managers gamed that rule, substituting youngsters after as little as a minute. So the football tsars mandated that they must play for the whole match. “The narrative every year ends up being ‘How have the rules changed?’,” sighs Cameron Wilson, founder of Wild East Football, a website devoted to the Chinese game.</p><p>For China’s national football team, the fundamental problem is not at the elite level but at the grassroots. In big cities there is little space for children to kick a ball around. A hyper-competitive education system, in any case, leaves them little time for play. Officials had hoped that glittering football academies would help. The world’s largest was opened by Evergrande in 2012 with 50 full-sized pitches. So far, though, none of its thousands of graduates has made the senior national team.</p><p>The football association has also tried to identify promising players early in life, placing them in development programmes—an approach that works for table tennis and diving but does not translate so well to team sports. “You don’t need an under-15 national team. You need thousands of under-15s playing,” says Joan Oliver, former boss of Barcelona, who now owns Beijing Institute of Technology Football Club in China’s second tier.</p><p>With qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup coming up, the government wants short cuts. Over the past three years China has started naturalising foreign footballers. On May 10th it named five, including three Brazilian-born forwards, to its squad. Mr Xi has called for greater self-reliance in China’s quest for global power. Football is a stark reminder that it still needs foreign imports.</p><p><a id="china-is-in-danger-of-being-humiliated-at-the-winter-olympics"></a></p><h1 id="China-is-in-danger-of-being-humiliated-at-the-winter-Olympics"><a href="#China-is-in-danger-of-being-humiliated-at-the-winter-Olympics" class="headerlink" title="China is in danger of being humiliated at the winter Olympics"></a>China is in danger of being humiliated at the winter Olympics</h1><p>Its ice-hockey team has been drawn against Canada and America</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In 2018 the Chinese men’s ice-hockey team qualified for the first time for the Olympic games, to be held in 2022 in Beijing, under a special dispensation for the host country. The cold reality of what this would mean was brought home last year when China was drawn in the same group in the competition as two powerhouses of the sport, Canada and America. A “slaughter” is likely, says China Sports Insider, a website. That would be a propaganda nightmare for the Communist Party, especially given the notable enthusiasm President Xi Jinping has shown for the sport.</p><p>In 2014 Mr Xi told an interviewer in Sochi, Russia, that ice hockey was his “favourite” winter sport to watch. Ice hockey also features most prominently in an official video about Mr Xi and the 2022 games. At one point he tells a group of young ice-hockey players that China’s “hopes are pinned on your generation”.</p><p>Efforts to boost the current generation of contenders have not gone well. Kunlun Red Star, a Chinese-owned club competing in Russia’s ice-hockey league, was meant to help. Mr Xi and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, attended the opening ceremony at the team’s formation in 2016 (they also attended a youth ice-hockey event together in 2018, pictured). Red Star set out to solve Mr Xi’s problem by recruiting foreigners of Chinese descent, including veterans of America’s National Hockey League, to move to China and become eligible to represent the country in 2022.</p><p>But Red Star and the state sports bureaucracy appear to have had a falling-out, and responsibility for the national team has been passed like an errant puck between the club and Chinese officials. The relationship grew frostier still in 2019 when a squad made up of Red Star’s weaker players annihilated the Chinese national team, 10-0.</p><p>The International Ice Hockey Federation in Zurich, which granted China its spot in the Olympics, wants to avoid even more lopsided results in February. On May 8th René Fasel, head of the federation, held a call with ice-hockey officials in China, a spokesman says, to discuss “how best to prepare the Chinese team” for the games.</p><p>The only realistic solution is for China to bring in the ethnic-Chinese players Red Star has already recruited. They are waiting in cities from Vancouver to Boston for the call to play. China would still be expected to lose at the Olympics, but avoiding humiliation would feel like victory. </p><p><a id="why-more-young-chinese-want-to-be-civil-servants"></a></p><h1 id="Why-more-young-Chinese-want-to-be-civil-servants"><a href="#Why-more-young-Chinese-want-to-be-civil-servants" class="headerlink" title="Why more young Chinese want to be civil servants"></a>Why more young Chinese want to be civil servants</h1><p>They are looking for security in a volatile time</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>When zhu ling graduated last year from a highly competitive master’s programme at one of China’s best universities, prestigious, well-paid jobs were hers for the taking. Instead she chose to become a civil servant for the central government, earning 6,000 yuan ($930) a month, or less than some Beijing professionals spend on gym membership.</p><p>A decade ago, Miss Zhu (not her real name) might have joined a multinational firm. They pay well, and it was “cool to work for foreign companies, because that shows your international horizons, and you can travel all over the world”, she says over cappuccino at an outdoor cafe in Beijing. Five years ago, top graduates vied to join home-grown technology giants like Alibaba, Tencent or Huawei. In addition to high salaries, such firms had free-thinking cultures and seemed to respect young people, she explains.</p><p>Today, the trends are changing again. China still wants foreign businesses for their know-how and dynamism, but their status “is definitely going down”, says Miss Zhu. Geopolitical distrust is bleeding into work relations. Chinese employed by foreigners have noticed that they never advance beyond middle management and are the first to be laid off in bad times, she claims. As for domestic technology firms, their high salaries continue to attract the young. But they also face vocal criticism in Chinese media for domineering business practices and the “996” work schedules of their staff, toiling from at least 9am to 9pm, six days a week. In all, a third of Miss Zhu’s classmates took civil-service examinations. Some were hired by state-owned banks. Three joined technology companies. None joined a foreign firm.</p><p>Chinese refer to securing an official position as shang an, or “landing ashore”, reflecting the security such jobs offer. In 2020, 1.6m people passed background checks to take national civil-service exams, 140,000 more than the year before. Almost a million candidates eventually sat the exam, chasing 25,700 jobs. Still more took tests to become provincial and local officials. Many were fleeing a bleak market for new graduates, as covid-19 hit private firms.</p><p>Miss Zhu says she joined an elite government ministry in search of meaningful work. She will soon spend two years as an official in a remote rural area, saying: “If you want to become a good policymaker, you have to go to the grassroots level.” A decade ago her parents would not have wanted her to join the public sector, she thinks. They distrusted officials, who routinely shook them down for bribes. Back then they would also have worried about her prospects as someone with no family guanxi, or connections: her grandfather was a farmer and her parents run a small business. She credits an anti-corruption drive that began in 2012 with changing their views of officialdom.</p><p>Miss Zhu’s blend of ambition and idealism is a good fit with the times. Qiushi, a theoretical journal, recently published a speech that President Xi Jinping made in January to national and provincial leaders. He described “chaos” in the outside world, celebrated China’s new strength and declared that “time and momentum are on our side”. Mr Xi also identified risks for China, ranging from dependence on foreign technologies to political turmoil should “an insurmountable gap between the rich and the poor” appear. He told officials to study the Soviet Union’s collapse, after its ruling Communist Party became “a privileged bureaucracy that defended only its own interests”.</p><p>Aware of public anger about inequality, Chinese propaganda has taken a populist turn, presenting the party as an ally against rapacious capitalism. In April authorities launched an anti-trust probe into Meituan, a food-delivery giant. Two days later Beijing Television showed a city official spending a day undercover, riding an electric scooter for Meituan. The exhausted bureaucrat told viewers that the work is “too difficult”, earning praise for his caring ways from the People’s Daily, a flagship party newspaper. Official media did not mention Chen Guojiang, a real-life Beijing delivery rider detained after posting videos of grim working conditions. He was charged on April 2nd with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a catch-all crime used against activists who challenge the party’s monopoly over questions of social justice.</p><p>Miss Zhu admits that idealism is not the only reason to join the public sector. A brilliant classmate might have become a university lecturer, but instead took a post at a highly selective high school. She became a teacher because, years from now, she will be entitled to a school place for her (as yet unborn) child. To millions of hard-pressed parents who see education as their children’s only hope of getting ahead, such planning makes perfect sense.</p><p>If you can’t beat ‘em…<br>Other civil servants accept a low salary because of the heavily subsidised housing, health insurance and pension that go with it. Some small-town or provincial Chinese take on boring government jobs that come with hard-to-secure residence papers for such megacities as Beijing or Shanghai. A sense of filial duty prompted Wu Hong, an only child who graduated in 2008, to leave his software business in the boomtown of Shenzhen and return to his home province of Jiangxi. Mr Wu (not his real name) is now a poorly paid local bureaucrat. “My parents are getting old, and in my small town there is no better place to find a stable job,” he says.</p><p>Offcn, an adult-education business, prepares millions of students each year for public-sector exams. It grew fast during the pandemic. “Training centres rose like bamboo shoots after rain,” says an Offcn manager in Beijing. He once looked down on civil-service jobs. Now he regrets missing the age limit—typically 35—for joining many government departments.</p><p>Ordinary Chinese are often cynical about officials as a class, deeming them slow to help and quick to conceal mistakes. But for many in the private economy, just keeping heads above water is an exhausting slog. Small wonder some dream of heading ashore. </p><p><a id="middle-east--africa---israel-and-hamas-move-closer-to-war"></a></p><h1 id="Middle-East-amp-Africa-—Israel-and-Hamas-move-closer-to-war"><a href="#Middle-East-amp-Africa-—Israel-and-Hamas-move-closer-to-war" class="headerlink" title="(Middle East &amp; Africa)—Israel and Hamas move closer to war"></a>(Middle East &amp; Africa)—Israel and Hamas move closer to war</h1><p>Where does this cycle of violence end?</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>What began last month as a dispute over metal barricades in Jerusalem has now, in the surreal logic of the Holy Land, brought Israel and Gaza to the brink of war. Since May 10th Palestinian militants in the territory have fired more than 1,600 rockets at Israel, which in turn has carried out hundreds of air strikes. It is by far the most intense round of warfare since 2014. Israeli bombs have destroyed three tower blocks in Gaza, in operations reportedly aimed at offices of Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls the territory. Hamas and its allies have fired huge barrages of rockets at Tel Aviv and southern Israel. Scores of people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed.</p><p>Both sides have threatened more violence, despite calls for the opposite from America, the European Union and Arab countries. Israel moved troops to the border with Gaza and told residents to stay in bomb shelters. Clashes between Arabs and Jews spread across Israel, which imposed a state of emergency in the city of Lod following riots by Israeli Arabs and the killing of an Arab man by a Jewish resident. The United Nations envoy to the Middle East, Tor Wennesland, warned that fighting was “escalating towards a full-scale war”.</p><p>The trouble started, as it so often does, with clashes over a small bit of land, intensified by the religious power of Jerusalem. In this case it was the sunken plaza around the Damascus Gate, one of the ancient entrances to the old walled city (see map). In April, at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s police chief decided “for security reasons” to fence off the area, a gathering spot for Palestinians. That led to clashes. The move was later reversed, but street battles between young Palestinians and Israeli police culminated in two big incidents in which police entered the area around the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third-holiest site, firing stun-grenades and rubber bullets. Hundreds of people were injured.</p><p>On May 10th thousands of Jewish nationalists added to the febrile atmosphere by marching, as they do every year, on “Jerusalem Day”—a holiday marking Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the six-day war in 1967. This year, at least, Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, ordered a last-minute change to the route, away from the Damascus Gate. That angered the marchers, but just as they were gathering at the roadblock preventing their progress to the gate, Hamas launched its rockets, setting off air-raid sirens and forcing them to disperse.</p><p>Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defence system has shot down most of the rockets; only a handful have got through to hit built-up areas. Israeli deaths remain in single digits. Avoiding further escalation depends partly on the system’s success. “What you’re seeing in the sky is the algorithm,” explains an engineer involved in tweaking the system the better to identify and intercept the most threatening rockets. “We’ve been constantly improving the algorithm so it can face a barrage like this.” Israel is also trying to stop the attacks at source. It has bombed about 200 launching sites, but there are still many more. Separately, it is trying to inflict pain on the militant groups by killing their leaders.</p><p>“The main strategic advantage of Iron Dome is that by significantly reducing Israeli civilian casualties, it allows the political leadership to pause before committing to all-out war,” says an Israeli general. “There’s no perfect weapon to prevent all casualties,” he adds. “For that you need peace.” But for now, peace does not seem either side’s favoured option. Israeli leaders have rejected a ceasefire and vowed to strike Hamas hard. The government remains anxious about an invasion of Gaza, though. Close-quarters fighting would favour the militants, and would involve many more casualties on all sides.</p><p>Whether Israel can defeat Hamas without shedding much blood may affect how Israelis think about Mr Netanyahu’s long-running policy of managing, rather than trying to solve, the conflict with the Palestinians. He has not seriously pursued a settlement, wagering that Palestinians have become resigned to the occupation or, if not, that he can suppress their anger. In Jerusalem 38% of the population are Palestinians, most of whom have “residency” rights, which gives them access to Israeli social security and health care. They are not treated as equals to Israelis, though, and face a variety of pressures to move out.</p><p>A case before Israel’s Supreme Court—now postponed, in light of the violence—is indicative. It concerns the eviction of some Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, which is largely Palestinian. The land on which their homes sit was owned by Jews before Jordan occupied the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1948. Under Israeli law the heirs of the original owners can reclaim the property because it is in East Jerusalem. Palestinian families have no such rights over their former homes in West Jerusalem. In fact, all property once owned by “absentee” Palestinians was expropriated by Israel.</p><p>The frustration this causes is fodder for Hamas. It expected to make big gains in Palestinian legislative elections on May 22nd (the first such ballot in 15 years). Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president and leader of Fatah, a rival party, decided last month to postpone the elections. Ostensibly he did so because Israel would not let some Palestinians vote at post offices in East Jerusalem. In fact, his main concern was that he might lose. By latching onto the protests in Jerusalem, Hamas hopes to boost its political standing, never mind the consequences for Gaza. Mr Abbas, meanwhile, has prevented Palestinians in the West Bank from organising protests in solidarity with their kin in Jerusalem.</p><p>On the Israeli side, Mr Netanyahu is tired and distracted. He has fought four elections in two years; none produced a conclusive result. His rivals have been edging closer to a deal that will remove him from power. Were he in a stronger position, he might have done more to rein in the police and his far-right supporters. But now that fighting has started, he has a chance to portray himself as a trusted wartime leader. He insists that Hamas should “pay a very heavy price”.</p><p>Foreign powers have been little help. Four months after President Joe Biden was inaugurated, there is still no American ambassador in Jerusalem. His administration seems torn about how to respond. The State Department blamed both sides for stoking tensions, but America later stalled a similar statement by the un Security Council. The previous un envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, was adept at dampening occasional spasms of violence before they escalated to war. Mr Wennesland, his successor and a veteran diplomat in the region, has inherited that challenge.</p><p>Mr Netanyahu has spent much of his career insisting that Israel need not make peace with the Palestinians. On his watch the occupied territories have been relatively quiet, at least compared to the violence of past Palestinian intifadas, or uprisings. Yet the events of the past month, the unrest that has spread from Jerusalem to every corner of the land, are a reminder that Palestinian grievances will not disappear. If Mr Netanyahu does leave office in the coming weeks, it is perhaps a fitting coda to his long rule.</p>]]></content>

Before the pandemic, tourists flocked there to <strong>gawk</strong> at the dazzling lights or to take selfies with someone dressed as Elmo or Spiderman, or maybe with the guitar-strumming Naked Cowboy (who in fact wears y-fronts). But for decades until the mid-1990s, New Yorkers and visitors alike avoided this “Crossroads of the World” because of its reputation for crime and drugs. On May 8th, when a gunfight erupted in Times Square and a <strong>toddler</strong> and two visitors were wounded, New Yorkers feared, not the first time, that their city was sliding back into its old ways.</p><p>On promises to make New York’s lights shine brighter than ever, about a dozen Democrats are running for mayor, known as the second-toughest job in America. They are elbowing one another for attention from the city’s diminished media. New Yorkers are still struggling to keep track of their names, much less the fine points of policy that (sort of) distinguish them. The candidate leading in the polls is the one with the most name recognition, Andrew Yang, who competed for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, and who is positioning himself as the field’s tech-<strong>savvy</strong> moderate. He was quick to condemn the shooting, saying “everything is <strong>contingent</strong> upon whether our streets and our subways are safe”. The Democratic primary is on June 22nd, and it is likely to be decisive. There are two Republican candidates running, but Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city seven to one.</p><p>Typically mayoral candidates find themselves arguing about how to manage New York’s growth. This is the first election for a generation in which they are confronting the <strong>hazards</strong> of shrinkage. Reliable numbers are hard to come by, but even before the epidemic the population was declining very slightly. Last year it shrank by perhaps 300,000 people (an estimate from cbs, a broadcaster, based on postal changes of address). Perhaps more worrying, the Partnership for New York City, an industry group, surveyed the city’s big employers and found that only 10% of Manhattan’s office workers had returned to their desks by March. Employers expect only 46% of their people back at their desks by September, and they expect 56% will work remotely at least part of the time after that.</p><p>With so many commuters vanishing, thousands of small businesses have closed their doors, taking one out of every eight jobs with them. On once-busy commercial streets, storefronts are empty and dark. Though Broadway is set to reopen in September, the <strong>hospitality</strong> industry has taken a beating during the pandemic: more than seven in ten of those working in the sector lost work last year. Across the city, employment is not expected to recover its pre-pandemic levels before 2024.</p><p>Crime is still much lower than it was at its height three decades ago, but New Yorkers list it among their top three priorities for the next mayor, along with stopping the spread of covid-19 and kick-starting the economy. Eric Adams, Brooklyn’s borough president and a former policeman, is second in most polls and has made combating crime a focus. He compared gun violence to a virus. “If we do not <strong>inoculate</strong> against it now, it will spread and spread and it will mean the death of countless New Yorkers and the city we have built.” <strong>Fearmongering</strong>, perhaps, but also a sign of how fearful many constituents are. When Mr Adams recently strolled down Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Avenue, which he once patrolled, many passers-by shared their concerns about violence with him. “I’m afraid to walk to work,” said one Fed-Ex worker.</p><p>Crime is again confronting many American cities. But the next mayor will also face problems that are peculiar to New York. One is how to raise taxes enough to finance more spending without prompting more Wall Street firms to leave town. Several, including Blackstone, a private-equity giant, have already opened offices in Florida, where taxes are far lower.</p><p>Another New-York-specific problem is the subway, <strong>beset</strong> before the pandemic by delays caused by an ageing signal system and now seeing a decline of two-thirds in daily riders, which was 5.6m before covid-19 struck. New York’s governor actually has more control over the subway, which only makes the next mayor’s task harder: the city will not rebound if the subway doesn’t. Not only the virus but fear of crime is keeping New Yorkers from going down into the tunnels. The current mayor, Bill de Blasio, has felt it necessary to create a travel-buddy scheme for city employees.</p><p>New Yorkers have more reason than usual to master fine distinctions among all the candidates because this is the first big-city election to be decided by ranked-choice voting. Voters will be able to express their preference, in order, for up to five candidates. But whom to rank where?</p><p>Each candidate has a plan for the city’s recovery. Ray McGuire, a former Citigroup executive, says through measures like salary subsidies to small businesses he will bring back 500,000 jobs. He ticks a lot of boxes. He had a modest <strong>upbringing</strong> by a single mother, but at Citi he advised on transactions even bigger than the city’s $99bn budget. Several progressive candidates, including Dianne Morales, a former non-profit executive, are calling for new programmes and higher taxes on the wealthy. But the city cannot raise taxes without the state government’s approval, and New York City already faces the highest income-tax rate in the country.</p><p>Mr Yang has some intriguing ideas, and New York’s mayors are supposed to do things that other cities copy. But he stands apart mainly because the city likes a star: Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg were all well-known before they became mayors. Mr Yang has said he would hire Kathryn Garcia, an experienced problem-solver in city government, to help him run the place. Like a true New Yorker, Ms Garcia, who is also a candidate, shot back that Mr Yang could work for her. </p><p><a id="what-to-do-about-skid-row"></a></p><h1 id="What-to-do-about-Skid-Row"><a href="#What-to-do-about-Skid-Row" class="headerlink" title="What to do about Skid Row"></a>What to do about Skid Row</h1><p>LA’s homeless encampment has been decades in the making. A judge wants it closed in months</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Skid Row：贫民区</p><p>Tanya mcnichols moved to Los Angeles from Cincinnati when Eartha Kitt died. She says she is on a mission from Jehovah. Asked how she spends her days, she fires off four words: “Shower, wash, read, pray.” Ms McNichols lives surrounded by her <strong>possessions</strong> on the street in front of the Union Rescue Mission, a non-profit that serves the homeless of Los Angeles’s Skid Row. Reverend Andrew Bales, who runs the Mission, sees Skid Row as a humanitarian disaster. “It couldn’t be a worse situation”, he says, “unless it was hell itself.” He has experienced this hell first-hand. While delivering water in the area, Reverend Bales contracted a painful infection that resulted in the partial <strong>amputation</strong> of both legs.</p><p>On April 20 a federal judge ordered the city and county to clean up Skid Row. In a flowery 110-page <strong>injunction</strong>, Judge David Carter <strong>chronicled</strong> the century-plus of history that <strong>culminated</strong> in Los Angeles’s contemporary homelessness crisis. In its final pages, he made his <strong>decree</strong>. Los Angeles must set aside $1bn to tackle homelessness. By mid-July, the city and county must offer shelter to all unaccompanied women and children on Skid Row. By October 18, the county must offer shelter to all of the homeless people in the area. The city and county are appealing against the order.</p><p>Los Angeles has long fought a losing battle against homelessness. The county provides around 50,000 shelter beds for a steadily increasing homeless population of more than 60,000. According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, an average of 207 people exit homelessness every day, while an average of 227 become homeless. Around 5,000 people are concentrated on Skid Row, a little over half of whom are in shelters or other temporary housing; the rest sleep rough. More than a third suffer from a substance use disorder and many are mentally ill or physically disabled. The area is <strong>squalid</strong>.</p><p>This concentration of misery is a result of both historical accident and deliberate policy. Beginning in the 1880s, the <strong>proximity</strong> of downtown Los Angeles to a rail terminal made it a <strong>locus</strong> for poor transient labourers. Charitable organisations and public agencies soon appeared to serve this population. In the 1960s, urban-renewal efforts reduced the area’s housing stock, and displaced residents flooded the streets. A deliberate policy of “<strong>containment</strong>” beginning in the mid-1970s led the city to concentrate services for the <strong>indigent</strong> within the 50-block area. Homeless people from across the region now <strong>gravitate</strong> there.</p><p>The city and county argue that Judge Carter’s ruling is an instance of judicial overreach and that its timeline is unreasonable. Mayor Eric Garcetti has suggested that it will complicate long-term planning around homelessness. Existing efforts include two ballot initiatives: Proposition hhh, which set aside more than $1bn to build up to 10,000 housing units for the homeless, and Measure h, which raised county sales taxes by a small amount to pay for improved services.</p><p>The problem with these efforts, charges Reverend Bales, is that they have proved expensive and slow. While the city dallies, he says, people are dying on the street. He has a point. In 2020 nearly four homeless people died in Los Angeles per day. The first units made possible by Proposition hhh, which passed in 2016, did not open until 2020. A third of the homes in the pipeline will cost more than $500,000 each to build. And the city has dragged its feet: although Los Angeles is eligible for federal <strong>reimbursement</strong> for homeless services, it has not even applied for the money; city officials plead a lack of staff.</p><p>In his order, Judge Carter takes the city to task for this “embarrassing performance”, arguing that it has long failed to achieve its stated goals. In addition to its requirement that the city shelter the residents of Skid Row, the order also imposes <strong>accountability</strong> requirements: the city must explain how funds intended to help with homelessness are being spent.</p><p>Some homelessness experts are sceptical. Suzanne Wenzel of the University of Southern California acknowledges that long-term solutions take time but worries that money for permanent fixes could now be <strong>siphoned</strong> off to temporary ones. And she fears unintended consequences. If the city is forced to rapidly clear Skid Row, she says, “they will be forced to make some decisions that are ultimately not going to be in the best interests of those now on the streets.” Gary Blasi, a law professor who works on homeless issues, agrees. “The way this city would comply with such an order”, he says, “would be to build shelters that people living in encampments find inferior to where they are now.”</p><p>What would be better? Experts recommend permanent supportive housing for those who may be struggling with mental illness or drug addiction, something Proposition hhh was supposed to do. The city also needs to find a way to bring down astronomical construction prices. And a better safety net would help: thousands of Angelenos spend nearly all they earn on rent, <strong>teetering</strong> on the edge of homelessness. Mr Blasi points out that la County’s general relief programme pays out a <strong>paltry</strong> $221 per month to indigent Angelenos.</p><p>On April 25, Judge Carter stayed some <strong>provisions</strong> of his initial order and agreed to give the city 60 days to spell out how its homelessness funds will be spent. He has invited the parties to discuss a settlement. Such a settlement might look like an earlier case Judge Carter presided over in nearby Orange County. In that one, the city could be required to create enough shelter for 60% of the homeless people in each city-council district. Council members would then be free to have remaining homeless people cleared from the area. Mr Blasi thinks this is a bad idea. “It does give individual city-council members power to clear encampments that are bothering their most powerful constituents,” he says. “But at the end of the day many of those people would still be homeless.” </p><p><a id="last-year-more-people-in-san-francisco-died-of-overdoses-than-of-covid-19"></a></p><h1 id="Last-year-more-people-in-San-Francisco-died-of-overdoses-than-of-covid-19"><a href="#Last-year-more-people-in-San-Francisco-died-of-overdoses-than-of-covid-19" class="headerlink" title="Last year, more people in San Francisco died of overdoses than of covid-19"></a>Last year, more people in San Francisco died of overdoses than of covid-19</h1><p>This is part of a worrying national trend, following changes in drug markets</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The first time Jean was offered heroin, she declined. One night, though, when she was 18 or 19, she decided to give it a try. Over the next few years, heroin led to meth, and meth led to fentanyl. It wasn’t until she got pregnant in 2017 that she decided to seek help. “I was at a point in my life where I kept consistently hitting rock bottom and I was ok with that,” says the 29-year-old from Denver. “But when I found out that I was pregnant with my daughter, I wanted better for her.”</p><p>Not everyone has such a realisation. While covid-19 <strong>rampaged</strong> across the country, America’s other epidemic has quietly boiled over. <strong>Provisional</strong> data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc) suggest that just over 90,000 Americans died by drug overdose in the 12 months to October 2020, a 30% increase on the previous year. That is more than the number of people who were killed last year by car crashes (42,000) and guns (44,000) combined. Roughly 55,000 of those who overdosed died from <strong>synthetic</strong> opioids such as fentanyl, a 57% jump year-on-year.</p><p>The pandemic seems partly to blame for the increase. Dr Chris Thurstone, the director of behavioural health services at Denver Health, says the isolation <strong>wrought</strong> by lockdowns can worsen depression and anxiety, and substance abuse often increases during economic downturns, when people have lost their jobs or are worried about their finances. More people may have used drugs alone, or been unable to seek medical help when clinics closed or stopped accepting new patients. But there is more to the story. America’s opioid epidemic has entered a dangerous new phase thanks in large part to shifting—and modernising—drug markets.</p><p>The roots of the epidemic can be traced back to <strong>prescription</strong> painkillers, such as OxyContin, which was introduced in 1996. In the 15 or so years it took for the prescription opioid crisis to turn into an <strong>illicit</strong> opioid crisis, the geography of the epidemic remained relatively stable. Many hoped fentanyl, which is up to 100 times more <strong>potent</strong> than morphine per gram, would not spread beyond the East Coast and Appalachia, where it has wreaked the most <strong>havoc</strong>. Users in Western states have historically preferred black-tar heroin, which does not mix as well with fentanyl, to the white-powder heroin found in the east. “Opiate users generally have their drug of choice,” says Bill Bodner, who runs the Los Angeles division of America’s Drug Enforcement Administration (dea). Older westerners addicted to opioids, “were tar heroin users, they are tar heroin users, and they are going to continue to be tar heroin users.”</p><p>Yet recent tallies show that the <strong>scourge</strong> has now found purchase in the West too. In San Francisco, more than twice as many people died from an accidental drug overdose last year as from covid-19. The city’s chief medical examiner estimates that fentanyl was detected in the bloodstream in nearly 73% of overdose deaths. In Las Vegas, overdose deaths from fentanyl increased from just 16 in 2015 to 219 in 2020.</p><p>Fentanyl’s spread is as much about geopolitics and organised crime as it is about local drug markets. China is the biggest supplier of the chemicals used to make fentanyl, and until recently the drug was often mailed directly to the United States in small parcels. In 2019 the Trump administration successfully lobbied the Chinese government to ban the illicit production and sale of fentanyl and similar substances. Afterwards, says Matthew Donahue, deputy chief of operations for the dea, direct shipments “virtually stopped”.</p><p>Fentanyl did not disappear, however. Chinese producers simply took the long way round, shipping the chemicals to Mexico for drug <strong>cartels</strong>—which were already <strong>trafficking</strong> heroin, meth and cocaine—to then move across the border. The amount of fentanyl seized by Mexican security forces nearly <strong>quintupled</strong> between 2019 and 2020. Once across the border, the cartels, Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation chief among them, use their established networks to distribute the drug throughout the United States.</p><p>It is not just the route that fentanyl travels that has changed. The drug is also shape-shifting. In Mexico, fentanyl is pressed into <strong>counterfeit</strong> pills made to resemble painkillers like OxyContin or hydrocodone. Just two milligrams of fentanyl can be fatal, so a pure fentanyl pill—or one pressed with another drug such as heroin or cocaine—can be deadly many times over. When the dea tested sample pills from drug <strong>seizures</strong> between January and March of 2019, 27% contained a lethal dose of fentanyl. John Pelletier, who runs the <strong>narcotics</strong> division of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, said his team responded to a fatal-overdose call where the two victims had their phones open to check the side-effects of OxyContin, not realising they had ingested a fentanyl pill.</p><p>Counterfeit pills are great business for the cartels. Fentanyl can be produced at one-hundredth the cost of heroin, says Keith Humphreys of Stanford University. The cartels “don’t need a field of poppy plants,” says Mr Donahue, “they just need a basement, house or small warehouse.”</p><p>The spread of fentanyl has changed the demographics of who is dying from opioids. In 2014, opioids killed whites at twice the rate as African-Americans. The overdose death rate among black Americans more than tripled in the five years to 2019 as fentanyl <strong>infiltrated</strong> the supply of illicit drugs. Young people in their 20s and 30s are also dying in greater numbers.</p><p>Higher death rates among younger Americans reflects a shift to online drug markets. The dark web, an obscure corner of the internet, has long been a source for illicit drugs. Now, counterfeit pills are readily available on gaming and social-media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok. The pandemic has accelerated the trend: Americans turned more frequently to the internet for drugs just as they did for toilet paper and groceries.</p><p>All this paints a bleak picture. Officials warn that the other epidemic, which has steadily worsened for decades, will get deadlier still before it gets better. President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which was passed in March, included nearly $4bn for mental health and substance-abuse services. Mr Biden has also made it easier to prescribe buprenorphine, a drug used to treat opioid addiction.</p><p>That is welcome, but 90,000 people dead suggests the need for a more muscular response. It would help if the dozen states that declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would change their stance, as that could provide <strong>methadone</strong> for addicts. Congress could also restart Medicaid—the government health-insurance programme for poor people—for prisoners in the weeks before they are released. A study in 2018 found that the risk of opioid overdose for former inmates in North Carolina was up to 40 times higher than for the state’s general population. It would be great to think that the problem could be fixed by choking off supply. But one constant of border policy in this and the previous administration is that fentanyl can always find a way in. </p><p><a id="a-cyber-attack-exposes-risks-to-america%E2%80%99s-energy-infrastructure"></a></p><h1 id="A-cyber-attack-exposes-risks-to-America’s-energy-infrastructure"><a href="#A-cyber-attack-exposes-risks-to-America’s-energy-infrastructure" class="headerlink" title="A cyber-attack exposes risks to America’s energy infrastructure"></a>A cyber-attack exposes risks to America’s energy infrastructure</h1><p>And the threats are likely to grow</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Pipelines, like cables and substations, are the type of dull, critical infrastructure that Americans don’t think about until, suddenly, they must. On May 7th a cyber-attack prompted Colonial Pipeline, a firm headquartered in Georgia, to shut down a tube stretching from Texas to New Jersey that supplies about 45% of the petrol and diesel used on the east coast. Federal officials confirmed that DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be based in the former Soviet Union, was responsible. “We’re not talking about some small pipeline,” explains Amy Myers Jaffe, author of “Energy’s Digital Future”, a new book. “We’re talking about the jugular.”</p><p>On May 12th Colonial Pipeline said it had “initiated the restart of pipeline operations”, a carefully worded statement that conveys both the difficulty of returning to normal and a desire to contain panic. That day average petrol prices topped $3 a gallon for the first time since 2014. Much depends on whether more drivers rush to buy petrol, as they did in the oil shocks of the 1970s. If 30m car-owners with half a tank decide to fill up, reckons s&amp;p Global Platts Analytics, a data group, they would guzzle over 4m barrels, more than the recent daily demand of the entire eastern seaboard. Many are already buying while they can. Long queues formed at petrol stations in the south-east on May 11th. Some stations limited purchases; others ran out of fuel. The White House said it had established “an inter-agency response group” to “ensure a continuing flow of fuel”.</p><p>Even if supplies are restored quickly, however, America faces a more stubborn problem. Despite more than a decade of attention to cyber-security, the country’s energy infrastructure—the pipelines, power generators and grids on which the economy depends—remains exposed to hackers. Indeed the energy system may yet become more vulnerable, not less.</p><p>Securing oil and electricity assets used to mean guarding against physical attacks: a bombing of a refinery, for instance. Those risks remain, but hackers can also inflict grave damage. In 2010 the Stuxnet worm, generally believed to have been deployed by Israel and America, targeted a nuclear facility in Iran. In 2015 and 2016 Russian hackers caused blackouts in Ukraine.</p><p>Aware of such risks, American executives and politicians have tried to mitigate them. The American Petroleum Institute, the country’s main oil lobby, has held an annual conference on cyber-security since 2006. The Department of Energy dutifully developed “The Energy Sector Specific Plan” for cyberthreats, in 2015, “The Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity”, in 2018 and “The 2020 Cybersecurity Multi-year Program Plan”, to name but a few.</p><p>Yet weaknesses remain. The shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline exposes gaps in companies’ cyber-armour. It also reveals the idea that shale oil might guarantee energy security to be a fallacy. Oil may be fungible but oil infrastructure is not, notes Michael Tran of rbc Capital Markets. America’s north-east is particularly exposed to attack, Mr Tran says. A dearth of local refineries makes the region dependent on pipelines and tankers for oil products.</p><p>The federal government’s cyber-defences are imperfect, too. The Government Accountability Office (gao), the agency charged with criticising other agencies, has found cyber-security a particularly rich subject. The Transportation Security Administration (tsa) is supposed to help safeguard oil and gas pipelines; in 2019 the gao identified “factors that limit the usefulness of tsa’s risk assessment”. In March the gao reported that the Department of Energy’s plans for cyber protection “do not fully address risks to the grid’s distribution systems”, leaving big cities vulnerable.</p><p>Worryingly, cyber-attacks may increase in number and ambition. Hackers are using ransomware to infiltrate larger companies and seek higher payments. Their average ransom payment has roughly doubled over the past year, according to Coveware, a tracking firm. Furthermore, changes to the electricity system may, without sufficient planning, make it more vulnerable. As more devices are connected to the internet, hackers have a larger number of targets. As more cars run on electricity rather than combustion, a blackout can wreak broader damage. And as transmission lines connect distant power systems, helping to balance intermittent wind and solar power, a problem in one grid can have an impact on another.</p><p>These challenges are not unique to America. But they pose a particular headache for President Joe Biden, who is trying to win support for climate proposals in his $2trn infrastructure bill. Limiting climate change and fighting cyberthreats are hardly mutually exclusive endeavours. Mr Biden must make a credible case that he can make America’s energy system both greener and more secure. </p><p><a id="in-america-a-million-evictions-take-place-in-a-normal-year"></a></p><h1 id="In-America-a-million-evictions-take-place-in-a-normal-year"><a href="#In-America-a-million-evictions-take-place-in-a-normal-year" class="headerlink" title="In America, a million evictions take place in a normal year"></a>In America, a million evictions take place in a normal year</h1><p>Covid-19 prompted a giant experiment in halting them. What were the consequences?</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Before covid-19, evictions were a hot topic, thanks to the publication of “Evicted”, a rare wonk-bestseller by Matthew Desmond of Princeton University. The book follows eight families turfed out of their homes in Milwaukee, their possessions unceremoniously dumped on the pavement. Mr Desmond estimates that there are 1m evictions a year in America, a staggering number given the relatively small number of people affected (about 2.3m adults and children). Then, when covid-19 hit, an experiment took place. The Trump administration issued an edict pausing evictions, a policy continued by the Biden White House. On May 5th a judge struck down the federal moratorium, apparently ending the experiment. What were the results?</p><p>The federal moratorium actually consisted of several policies spanning the Trump and Biden administrations. From March to August 2020 it was part of the cares Act. From September it took the form of a directive from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc), which was extended three times to end on June 30th this year. The cdc claimed authority on the ground that evicting people in the middle of an epidemic was a public-health risk. That seems to be true. From May to September 2020, 27 states lifted their eviction moratoriums. Comparing the trend before the pandemic to the trend in infection and deaths once the moratoriums were lifted, researchers estimate that states without moratoriums experienced covid-19 infection rates twice as high as states with them.</p><p>As this suggests, state and local governments have interpreted the moratoriums differently. New Hampshire required landlords to file affidavits stating compliance with the cdc before proceeding with an eviction. Some have paused removals but not court hearings, filings and eviction notices. Other places have refused outright to comply, for example Jackson County, Missouri, which included half of Kansas City. This patchwork of policies has confused millions of Americans, with several hundred faced eviction despite federal policies that seemingly banned it.</p><p>Forty-three states issued some form of an eviction moratorium during the epidemic. The Eviction Lab, a research group headed by Mr Desmond at Princeton, estimates that the federal moratorium prevented at least 1.6m eviction filings in 2020. This reduced filings by 35% compared with the historical average, a notable achievement during an economic slump. By contrast, during the two-week pause between the cares Act ending in August 2020 and the cdc eviction moratorium beginning in September, evictions rose back to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>The cost of this policy fell mostly on landlords. And in many poor post-industrial cities, the kind of place featured in “Evicted”, much affordable housing is supplied by small landlords. Many of them are struggling to make ends meet themselves. Some are being forced to sell off properties to cut their losses. These sales could reduce the availability of low-cost housing, pushing up the cost of housing and, eventually, resulting in more evictions.</p><p>What, then, are the lessons of the evictions pause? One is that the policy needs to be paired with help for tenants and landlords, in the form of rental assistance or vouchers. Billions of federal dollars have been provided for pandemic-related emergency rental assistance ($25bn under the Trump administration and $22bn under the Biden administration). But the Urban Institute, a think-tank, estimates that at least $50bn is needed to cover rent owed. And according to the Eviction Lab, many tenants are being evicted before the funds are being disbursed. In Texas, only 250 households received assistance out of 70,000 applicants by the end of March.</p><p>Increasing the stock of affordable housing would also help. In 1999 the Faircloth Amendment, an amendment to the Housing Act of 1937, capped the amount of housing that could be owned by the Public Housing Authority. So for any public housing unit to be built, one must be taken away. Finally, unlike the procedure in criminal cases, renters facing eviction are not guaranteed a lawyer. So whereas 90% of landlords have legal counsel, only 10% of tenants do. And lawyers make a difference. In New York City, 84% of renters represented by counsel avoided eviction after the city made lawyers more widely available. That would also slow evictions down, without penalising landlords unfairly. </p>]]></content>

Here is what to do next<br>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>This week we publish our estimate of the true death toll from covid-19. It tells the real story of the pandemic. But it also contains an urgent warning. Unless vaccine supplies reach poorer countries, the tragic scenes now unfolding in India risk being repeated elsewhere. Millions more will die.</p><p>Using known data on 121 variables, from recorded deaths to <strong>demography</strong>, we have built a pattern of correlations that lets us fill in gaps where numbers are lacking. Our model suggests that covid-19 has already claimed 7.1m-12.7m lives. Our central estimate is that 10m people have died who would otherwise be living. This <strong>tally</strong> of “excess deaths” is over three times the official count, which nevertheless is the basis for most statistics on the disease, including fatality rates and cross-country comparisons.</p><p>The most important insight from our work is that covid-19 has been harder on the poor than anyone knew. Official figures suggest that the pandemic has struck in waves, and that the United States and Europe have been hit hard. Although South America has been ravaged, the rest of the developing world seemed to get off lightly.</p><p>Our modelling tells another story. When you count all the bodies, you see that the pandemic has spread <strong>remorselessly</strong> from the rich, connected world to poorer, more isolated places. As it has done so, the global daily death rate has climbed steeply.</p><p>Death rates have been very high in some rich countries, but the overwhelming majority of the 6.7m or so deaths that nobody counted were in poor and middle-income ones. In Romania and Iran excess deaths are more than double the number officially put down to covid-19. In Egypt they are 13 times as big. In America the difference is 7.1%.</p><p>India, where about 20,000 are dying every day, is not an outlier. Our figures suggest that, in terms of deaths as a share of population, Peru’s pandemic has been 2.5 times worse than India’s. The disease is working its way through Nepal and Pakistan. Infectious variants spread faster and, because of the <strong>tyranny</strong> of <strong>exponential</strong> growth, overwhelm health-care systems and fill mortuaries even if the virus is no more <strong>lethal</strong>.</p><p>Ultimately the way to stop this is vaccination. As an example of collaboration and pioneering science, covid-19 vaccines rank with the Apollo space programme. Within just a year of the virus being discovered, people could be protected from severe disease and death. Hundreds of millions of them have benefited.</p><p>However, in the short run vaccines will fuel the divide between rich and poor. Soon, the only people to die from covid-19 in rich countries will be exceptionally <strong>frail</strong> or exceptionally unlucky, as well as those who have <strong>spurned</strong> the chance to be vaccinated. In poorer countries, by contrast, most people will have no choice. They will remain unprotected for many months or years.</p><p>The world cannot rest while people <strong>perish</strong> for want of a jab costing as little as $4 for a two-dose course. It is hard to think of a better use of resources than vaccination. Economists’ central estimate for the direct value of a course is $2,900—if you include factors like long covid and the effect of impaired education, the total is much bigger. The benefit from an extra 1bn doses supplied by July would be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Less circulating virus means less <strong>mutation</strong>, and so a lower chance of a new variant that reinfects the vaccinated.</p><p>Supplies of vaccines are already growing. By the end of April, according to Airfinity, an analytics firm, vaccine-makers produced 1.7bn doses, 700m more than the end of March and ten times more than January. Before the pandemic, annual global vaccine capacity was roughly 3.5bn doses. The latest estimates are that total output in 2021 will be almost 11bn. Some in the industry predict a global surplus in 2022.</p><p>And yet the world is right to strive to get more doses in more arms sooner. Hence President Joe Biden has proposed waiving intellectual-property claims on covid-19 vaccines. Many experts argue that, because some manufacturing capacity is going begging, millions more doses might become available if patent-owners shared their secrets, including in countries that today are at the back of the queue. World-trade rules allow for a waiver. When to invoke them if not in the <strong>throes</strong> of a pandemic?</p><p>We believe that Mr Biden is wrong. A waiver may signal that his administration cares about the world, but it is at best an empty gesture and at worst a <strong>cynical</strong> one.</p><p>A waiver will do nothing to fill the urgent shortfall of doses in 2021. The head of the World Trade Organisation, the forum where it will be <strong>thrashed out</strong>, warns there may be no vote until December. Technology transfer would take six months or so to complete even if it started today. With the new mrna vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, it may take longer. Supposing the tech transfer was faster than that, experienced vaccine-makers would be unavailable for hire and makers could not obtain inputs from suppliers whose order books are already bursting. Pfizer’s vaccine requires 280 inputs from suppliers in 19 countries. No firm can recreate that in a hurry.</p><p>In any case, vaccine-makers do not appear to be <strong>hoarding</strong> their technology—otherwise output would not be increasing so fast. They have struck 214 technology-transfer agreements, an <strong>unprecedented</strong> number. They are not <strong>price-gouging</strong>: money is not the <strong>constraint</strong> on vaccination. Poor countries are not being priced out of the market: their vaccines are coming through covax, a global distribution scheme funded by donors.</p><p>In the longer term, the effect of a waiver is unpredictable. Perhaps it will indeed lead to technology being transferred to poor countries; more likely, though, it will cause harm by disrupting supply chains, wasting resources and, ultimately, deterring innovation. Whatever the case, if vaccines are nearing a surplus in 2022, the <strong>cavalry</strong> will arrive too late.</p><p>A needle in time<br>If Mr Biden really wants to make a difference, he can donate vaccine right now through covax. Rich countries over-ordered because they did not know which vaccines would work. Britain has ordered more than nine doses for each adult, Canada more than 13. These will be urgently needed elsewhere. It is wrong to put teenagers, who have a <strong>minuscule</strong> risk of dying from covid-19, before the elderly and health-care workers in poor countries. The rich world should not <strong>stockpile</strong> boosters to cover the population many times over on the <strong>off-chance</strong> that they may be needed. In the next six months, this could yield billions of doses of vaccine.</p><p>Countries can also improve supply chains. The Serum Institute, an Indian vaccine-maker, has struggled to get parts such as filters from America because exports were gummed up by the Defence Production Act (dpa), which puts suppliers on a war-footing. Mr Biden authorised a one-off release, but he should be focusing the dpa on supplying the world instead. And better use needs to be made of finished vaccine. In some poor countries, vaccine <strong>languishes</strong> unused because of hesitancy and chaotic organisation. It makes sense to <strong>prioritise</strong> getting one shot into every vulnerable arm, before setting about the second.</p><p>Our model is not predictive. However it does suggest that some parts of the world are particularly vulnerable—one example is South-East Asia, home to over 650m people, which has so far been spared mass fatalities for no obvious reason. Covid-19 has not yet run its course. But vaccines have created the chance to save millions of lives. The world must not <strong>squander</strong> it.</p><p><a id="only-negotiations-can-bring-lasting-peace-to-israel-and-palestine"></a></p><h1 id="Only-negotiations-can-bring-lasting-peace-to-Israel-and-Palestine"><a href="#Only-negotiations-can-bring-lasting-peace-to-Israel-and-Palestine" class="headerlink" title="Only negotiations can bring lasting peace to Israel and Palestine"></a>Only negotiations can bring lasting peace to Israel and Palestine</h1><p>Managing the conflict is no solution<br>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>It was a confrontation waiting to happen, in a conflict the world would rather ignore. Israelis and Palestinians have once again <strong>goaded</strong> each other to the brink of war in the Holy Land. Hundreds of rockets, fired by Palestinian militants, have been aimed at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and southern Israel. Gaza, the Palestinian territory run by Hamas, a violent Islamist movement, has been hit even harder by Israeli air strikes. Arabs and Jews have clashed in the streets of Israeli cities. Dozens of people, most of them Palestinian, have been killed.</p><p>The worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in years has Jerusalem at its heart, as so often (see Middle East &amp; Africa section). In April, at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s police chief fenced off the <strong>plaza</strong> around the Damascus Gate, one of the entrances to Jerusalem’s old walled city and a gathering spot for Palestinians. The move, made for “security reasons”, led to clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. Hundreds were injured. Then the rockets started flying.</p><p>The violence, as ever, is <strong>counterproductive</strong>. Turning Israeli cities “into hell”, as Hamas threatens, will not help the Palestinians who suffer grievously in Gaza—just the opposite, in fact. Every rocket that Hamas fires makes it easier for Israel to claim that it has “no partner for peace” and to intensify its siege of Gaza. But Israel, too, must reconsider its strategy. Its leaders view the broader conflict as something to be managed, not solved. Yet its unjust treatment of the Palestinians stores up trouble. Today’s crisis was predictable—even if the spark that ignited it was not.</p><p>Jerusalem <strong>epitomises</strong> the problem. Israel claims the city as its “eternal and undivided capital”. But its inhabitants are <strong>irrevocably</strong> split. The eastern part of the city, although captured by Israel in 1967, remains largely Palestinian. The Oslo accords of 1993 left the city’s status to be settled in a permanent peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. But Israel has built a wall separating Jerusalem from the Palestinian hinterland. It seeks to strengthen its claim to the whole city by ringing it with new Jewish homes and squeezing Palestinians out. Though they make up 38% of Jerusalem’s population, most local Palestinians are not citizens but mere “residents”, granted access to health care and social security, but not the same rights as Jews.</p><p>This <strong>disparity</strong> in the law is at the heart of a case before Israel’s Supreme Court that is making the atmosphere more <strong>febrile</strong>. The court is reviewing a judgment to evict Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. Their homes sit on land that was owned by Jews before Jordan occupied the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1948. Israeli law allows the heirs of the original owners to reclaim property in East Jerusalem. Yet Palestinians cannot claim their former homes in West Jerusalem (or anywhere else in Israel). No wonder Palestinian residents of the city are always ready to protest.</p><p>The injustices elsewhere are worse. Palestinians in the wider West Bank, like those in Jerusalem, have watched Israel <strong>confiscate</strong> land and build settlements on occupied territory, which is illegal under international law. They must also deal with Israeli checkpoints and an <strong>onerous</strong> permit regime. In Gaza more than 2m Palestinians have been cut off from the world by Israeli and Egyptian <strong>blockades</strong> since 2007, when Hamas grabbed control. The territory struggles to keep the lights on; the tap water is filthy. Despair at such conditions led to violence in 2018 and 2019, and is feeding the current <strong>spasm</strong>.</p><p>Yet Israeli politicians ignore the conflict. The Palestinian issue did not feature in any of the four elections Israel has recently held. Most Israelis are comfortable with the “anti-solutionism” of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who shows little interest in pursuing a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. His domestic rivals are edging closer to a deal that would push him out of power. But, before the recent violence, they said little about how they would handle the conflict.</p><p>Palestinian leaders have made it easy for Israel to give up on peace. Hamas is more interested in firing rockets than improving the lives of Gazans. Its rival, Fatah, has not done much better in the West Bank. The party’s leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is in the 17th year of a four-year term as Palestine’s president. He seems concerned mainly with preserving his own power. On April 29th, blaming Israel for restricting voting in East Jerusalem, he indefinitely postponed elections that Fatah was likely to lose.</p><p>With little hope of a better future, a good number of young Palestinians favour confronting Israel. That makes repeated <strong>fits of</strong> deadly violence inevitable. Only negotiations will bring lasting peace. Western and regional powers should press for them to resume; Israeli and Palestinian leaders should come to the table. Solving the conflict will be even harder than managing it. But talking is the one permanent way out. </p><p><a id="the-coming-global-economic-boom-could-have-a-sting-in-the-tail"></a></p><h1 id="The-coming-global-economic-boom-could-have-a-sting-in-the-tail"><a href="#The-coming-global-economic-boom-could-have-a-sting-in-the-tail" class="headerlink" title="The coming global economic boom could have a sting in the tail"></a>The coming global economic boom could have a sting in the tail</h1><p>Supply shortages are acute in America</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The global economy is entering unfamiliar territory. After a decade of worries about inadequate demand and spending power in the <strong>aftermath</strong> of the global financial crisis, signs of insufficient supply are now emerging. A lack of goods, services and people means that red-hot demand is increasingly met slowly or not at all. There are already signs that supply bottlenecks may lead to nasty surprises which could upset the post-pandemic recovery. Nowhere are shortages more acute than in America, where a boom is under way. Consumer spending is growing by over 10% at an annual rate, as people put to work the $2trn-plus of extra savings accumulated in the past year. More stimulus is still being <strong>doled out</strong>.</p><p>The boom is creating two kinds of bottleneck. The first relates to supply chains. There are shortages of everything from timber to semiconductors. The cost of shipping goods from China to America has tripled. Companies have not reported supplier delays this severe in decades. In the past year many firms have cut their investment in <strong>logistics</strong>. Lockdowns have left some container ships <strong>stranded</strong>. Companies are trying to go from 0 to 60 and it shows.</p><p>The second kind of bottleneck is in labour markets. In April America created only 266,000 jobs, many fewer than the 1m or more that had been expected. Yet job vacancies are at all-time highs, and so firms are struggling to fill positions. Economists argue over whether generous unemployment benefits are giving people a reason not to look for work. It also takes time for people to move from dying industries to growing ones.</p><p>As booming demand runs up against tight supply, inflation is in the spotlight. In April American consumer prices rose by 4.2% year on year, up from 2.6% in March. This partly reflects “base effects”: oil prices are only as high as they were in 2019, but 272% higher than in April 2020. It also reflects a genuine underlying rise in global prices. China’s factory-gate prices are rising at the fastest rate in over three years.</p><p>Central banks insist that their maximal stimulus must continue for fear of <strong>jeopardising</strong> the <strong>nascent</strong> recovery. Lael Brainard, a governor of the Federal Reserve, has said that the inflation spike as the economy reopens will be “largely <strong>transitory</strong>”. Jerome Powell, the chairman, sees little reason to worry. The Fed will tolerate somewhat above-target inflation for a bit, in part because it expects prices soon to fall back. So do many forecasters.</p><p>Yet this approach carries dangers. One is that inflation fades slowly. The supply bottlenecks of the early phase of the pandemic in 2020 cleared fast, but there is no guarantee this will happen now. Inflation expectations may also rise if people come to believe that central banks will act slowly and too late. Many companies are now discussing inflation with their investors. Bond-market traders think the Fed will be forced to act sooner than it wants. Bill Dudley, a former governor, worries that the Fed will have to raise interest rates to as high as 4.5% to cool the economy.</p><p>This points to the danger that sharp rate rises rock markets. So far the main event has been a sell-off in tech stocks, which is manageable. Banks are well capitalised. Yet the recent implosions of Archegos, a hedge fund, and Greensill Capital, a finance firm, are a reminder of the hidden <strong>leverage</strong> in a financial system that has come to depend on low interest rates. The post-pandemic boom may not always be exciting for the right reasons. </p><p><a id="the-queen%E2%80%99s-speech-reveals-the-meaning-of-johnsonism"></a></p><h1 id="The-Queen’s-Speech-reveals-the-meaning-of-Johnsonism"><a href="#The-Queen’s-Speech-reveals-the-meaning-of-Johnsonism" class="headerlink" title="The Queen’s Speech reveals the meaning of Johnsonism"></a>The Queen’s Speech reveals the meaning of Johnsonism</h1><p>The prime minister wants a big state that <strong>crimps</strong> civil liberties</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Conservatism, as practised by the British Conservative Party, is a capacious <strong>creed</strong>, open to a wide range of interpretations. For Margaret Thatcher, it meant the moral and economic discipline of the free market; for David Cameron, liberal centrism and the embrace of globalisation.</p><p>Boris Johnson’s interpretation has been hard to <strong>decipher</strong>, partly because it has been obscured by the chaos of covid-19 and partly because he has never shown any commitment to a set of political ideas. So the Queen’s Speech, delivered on May 11th, in which the government presents its programme for the next session of parliament, was of particular interest. It was the clearest expression so far of what might one day be called Johnsonism.</p><p>That Mr Johnson is now thought quite likely to be in power for long enough to have his own “ism” would have surprised many just a year ago. His management of the early stages of the pandemic was lethally <strong>slipshod</strong>, and there was much grumbling about his leadership. However, on May 6th the Conservatives <strong>thumped</strong> the Labour Party in a by-election and in a series of local polls.</p><p>Mr Johnson’s popularity springs from several sources. One is a successful vaccine roll-out, and consequent liberation of the population from lockdown. Another is Mr Johnson himself. His <strong>boisterous</strong> willingness to outrage liberal sensibilities goes down well outside the cities, and his finely tuned political instincts have led him to <strong>espouse</strong> a combination of cultural conservatism and statist economics that has more in common with Gaullism or Eisenhower’s “modern Republicanism” than it has with Thatcherism or Cameron-style conservatism.</p><p>Some of the intervention that the government promises is welcome. It plans to boost investment in r&amp;d and to “level up” the country by splashing out on infrastructure and on vocational education, which both need money and attention. It promises to reform the planning system, which allows homeowners to veto development and thus condemns Britons to live in expensive rabbit-hutches.</p><p>Mr Johnson’s solution to the problem of <strong>nimbyism</strong> is to limit local authorities’ say on planning, giving central government more control over development. Whether or not he will really face down angry suburbanites in the Home Counties over new houses—he has already <strong>bottled out</strong> of a previous attempt—this approach derives from the fundamental problem with Johnsonism: his tendency to grab power. If local authorities do not want development, Mr Johnson’s answer is not to give them more say over taxation and thus an incentive to grow, but to force them to accept it. If parts of the country are poor, his answer is not to allow them to develop their own growth strategies, but to create a central fund to give them money.</p><p>The government is extending its control over the economy, too. Its plan for freeports is an attempt to direct investment to particular parts of the country. It is taking the opportunity that Brexit offers to give itself more <strong>discretion</strong> over handing out money to private companies and over using public <strong>procurement</strong> to further its levelling-up agenda. Both should send shivers down taxpayers’ spines.</p><p>The programme also includes a constitutional power-grab. Mr Johnson has had his sights set on the judiciary ever since the Supreme Court prevented him from <strong>proroguing</strong> Parliament over Brexit in 2019. That explains plans to limit the judges’ power to challenge the executive, as well as to restore the executive’s discretion over when to call an election, which Mr Cameron’s coalition government had renounced.</p><p>And as state power extends, so civil liberties will be crimped. The government has entertained new restraints on protest, limitations on asylum and voter-id requirements. It looks set on <strong>meddling</strong> in culture and universities. These measures are all designed to press culturally conservative voters’ hot-buttons.</p><p>Johnsonism unbound<br>For a prime minister who hopes to use his newly recovered <strong>mandate</strong> to call an early election and wants to be seen to be doing stuff, the extension of central-government power has a clear appeal. For this newspaper, which puts a high price on civil liberties and believes that smaller states and freer markets make for more prosperous countries, it does not. </p><p><a id="time-to-fix-the-way-governments-tax-multinational-companies"></a></p><h1 id="Time-to-fix-the-way-governments-tax-multinational-companies"><a href="#Time-to-fix-the-way-governments-tax-multinational-companies" class="headerlink" title="Time to fix the way governments tax multinational companies"></a>Time to fix the way governments tax multinational companies</h1><p>The answer lies in reducing incentives to shift profits to havens</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Tax companies too much, and growth will <strong>shrivel</strong>. Tax them too little, and <strong>resentment</strong> will soar. The public and politicians in Western countries have long thought the treatment of multinationals falls too close to that second extreme. Now the system is reaching breaking-point. Over 40 countries are <strong>squabbling</strong> over how to impose <strong>levies</strong> on Silicon Valley firms. Meanwhile the pandemic is forcing governments to find ways to plug their fiscal deficits, not least the Biden administration, which wants to increase multinationals’ tax rate.</p><p>The best hope for an <strong>amicable</strong> outcome lies in a forum run by the oecd, a club of mainly rich countries, where this summer 139 countries hope to agree on new tax principles. Success would represent the most important overhaul to the international architecture in a century. It would also help avoid chaos.</p><p>In theory, globe-trotting companies pay taxes based on where they have their headquarters, and where they do the work that produces their profits. An individual firm’s legal affiliates are typically taxed separately, with transfers between them recorded as if on the open market. In practice, firms cut their tax bills by divorcing their reported profits from where they conduct business.</p><p>This has become easier because of the rise of <strong>intangible</strong> assets such as brands. The share of American multinationals’ foreign profits booked in tax havens has doubled since 2000, to 63% in 2018. We estimate they had only 5% of their staff in these places. They booked more profit in Bermuda than in China.</p><p>Tax havens insist that rock-bottom tax rates are an expression of their sovereignty. But around the world <strong>exchequers</strong> are robbed of up to $240bn a year by firms <strong>rerouting</strong> profits, the oecd reckons. Taxpayers in America or France are right to feel aggrieved when the income a tech firm generates there is magicked away to Ireland or a shell company in the Caribbean.</p><p>A globally co-ordinated minimum tax would blunt the incentive to engage in <strong>shenanigans</strong>. Some 330,000 people list “transfer pricing” on their LinkedIn profile. Treating companies as a whole, rather than relying on transfer pricing, could reduce the army of advisers running circles around tax authorities. Allocating taxing rights according to where firms really operate would be harder to game, as consumers and staff are less mobile than algorithms.</p><p>Talks at the oecd are at least moving in the right direction, with both a minimum tax and a reallocation of taxing rights under discussion. The Biden administration wants a minimum global rate of 21%, but <strong>squeals</strong> from havens mean that 10-15% is more probable. Some global profits are likely to be freed from the broken “arm’s length” transfer-pricing approach, but only a small slice of them.</p><p>Bolder reform would be better. Tax authorities should do away with the fiction that intangible capital can be priced accurately through transfer pricing and instead try to reflect where activity takes place, by looking at sales and where employees are. This would benefit not only <strong>short-changed</strong> advanced economies but also poorer countries, which often lose out too.</p><p>Time is of the essence. Without reform, the distortion and disorder will worsen. Corporate tax-departments will <strong>arbitrage</strong> <strong>mismatches</strong> between different countries’ tax laws. And countries that are short-changed will take action on their own, leading to an <strong>acrimonious</strong> tangle of tax grabs and tariff <strong>spats</strong>. </p><p><a id="briefing---how-can-more-covid-19-vaccines-be-made-available"></a></p><h1 id="Briefing-—How-can-more-covid-19-vaccines-be-made-available"><a href="#Briefing-—How-can-more-covid-19-vaccines-be-made-available" class="headerlink" title="(Briefing)—How can more covid-19 vaccines be made available?"></a>(Briefing)—How can more covid-19 vaccines be made available?</h1><p><strong>The nuts and bolts</strong> of scaling up production matter more than intellectual property</p><p>来源：2021-05-15 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Biomedicine has never seen anything like it. This time last year, no company had ever made a vaccine against sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid 19, on an industrial scale. By the middle of this April a billion doses had been delivered. According to Airfinity, a data provider, a second billion doses are expected by June 1st. On current estimates the world’s <strong>pharmaceutical</strong> companies look set to provide 10.9bn doses over the course of 2021.</p><p>So far this effort has increased the world’s capacity for producing vaccines of all sorts by a factor of three to four. “It’s insane,” says Tim Gardner, the boss of Riffyn, a biotechnology startup focused on speeding up drug-production processes. “It’s an incredible success.”</p><p>At the same time many parts of the world have no smooth-running avenues of supply. The Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (covax), a vaccine-sharing scheme designed to provide supplies to low- and middle-income countries, has so far distributed only 59m doses. Most of the most vulnerable unvaccinated people look unlikely to be vaccinated soon. This is both inequitable and inefficient; it will increase the death toll and prolong the pandemic, increasing both economic losses and the odds of new variants of concern.</p><p>A recent report from the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, made the case for continued government investment in vaccine-production capacity, putting the idea into the context of long-term strategies such as “co-ordinated approaches to the sharing of intellectual property and technology transfer”.</p><p>It is the sharing of intellectual property, not increased investment, which has drawn the most attention. Since last October, South Africa and India have been arguing for an arrangement whereby the World Trade Organisation no longer obliges countries to protect patents, industrial designs, copyright and trade secrets which apply to covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. America, Britain, the European Union and Switzerland—home, between them, to most of the world’s big drugmakers—opposed the waiver. But on May 5th President Joe Biden broke ranks. Katherine Tai, the us trade representative, said that the administration would support proposals to waive intellectual property protections for covid-19 vaccines, winning the administration <strong>plaudits</strong> from over 100 countries which support the waiver as well as from people at home who think drug companies inherently <strong>villainous</strong>.</p><p>If such a waiver is agreed on, it will not be soon. <strong>Proponents</strong> take that in their stride: better to arrive at the end of the year with a waiver agreement close to hand and no need to use it, goes one argument, than still to be facing a global crisis of unmanageable proportions but with a diplomatic mountain to climb. That may be so. But the world’s need to create new production facilities, and ideally to work the various capabilities it has already developed even harder, will not wait. And intellectual-property rights are far from the most pressing, or most restrictive, constraint.</p><p>Billion wise, trillion foolish<br>The increase in capacity seen over the past year was brought about in large part because of government interventions, most notably Operation Warp Speed in America and the activities of the Vaccine Taskforce in Britain, which guaranteed payments and drove the expansion of supply chains.</p><p>These efforts splashed around a lot of money which, if none of the vaccines had worked, would have been lost. But with the benefit of <strong>hindsight</strong> it is now hard not to wish they had been more generous still. In March Science, a journal, published estimates from a group of economists of the total global economic loss that would have been avoided if enough money to produce vaccines for the entire world had been provided up front, rather than enough for most of the rich world. They calculated that if the world had put in place a vaccine-production infrastructure capable of pumping out some 1.2bn doses per month by January 2021, it would have saved the global economy almost $5trn (see chart).</p><p>Eric Budish of the Chicago Booth School of Business, one of the model’s authors, explains the situation using a plumbing metaphor: it is faster to lay down a wider-bore pipe at the start of a project than to expand a narrow one later. The rich world succeeded in producing effective vaccines remarkably quickly in quantities broadly sufficient to its needs: an extraordinary achievement. But the capacity of the system it built in order to do so created constraints that the rest of the world must now live with. That was a choice, not destiny.</p><p>But if the best time to invest was last year, the second best is now. Three distinct types of vaccine—based on mrna, on dna packaged inside an adenovirus, and on inactivated sars-cov-2 particles—have been widely authorised for use, if in most cases and places only on an emergency basis. Companies that play a role in relevant supply chains are able to invest with an assuredness about what is to come that they could not have had last year. Thermo Fisher, an American firm which sells a range of scientific and pharmaceutical supplies, having seen “mrna confidence increase on the demand side”, is spending $60m on a facility in Texas that will produce more of the nucleotide building blocks from which mrna vaccines are assembled.</p><p>The mrna vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are, in general, those which Western customers are most excited about seeing scaled up. Moderna is <strong>ramping</strong> up production around the world; it recently announced that it will make 3bn doses next year. On May 10th BioNTech said it plans to create a factory with an annual capacity of several hundred million doses in Singapore. The firm is in discussion with other countries about further production sites. A joint venture with Fosun Pharma, a Chinese firm, could make up to 1bn doses a year. A number of African countries are known to be keen on bringing the technology to the continent.</p><p>Unfortunately for the vulnerable people at growing risk around the world none of this will be quick. Stéphane Bancel, the boss of Moderna, says that it takes six to nine months at a minimum to add significant capacity, which means there is no way to increase capacity this year beyond what is already planned. Even when a company has a site ready to take mrna manufacturing equipment, machines have to be ordered, built, shipped and installed, a reliable supply of raw materials has to be arranged and people have to be hired, trained and brought up to speed on the processes involved.</p><p>Pollyanna, meet Polanyi<br>Building up the <strong>requisite</strong> knowledge in the new teams is the hardest task. The problem, says Rob Carlson, a veteran biotechnology investor, is that that knowledge is not stored in a format that is easy to copy between facilities. Each vaccine is produced according to a “recipe” which lists the settings for all of the things in a production facility that can be changed from job to job: every dial on every machine, timings, temperatures, masses, volumes and concentrations. Such a recipe may run to hundreds of pages. And it will still typically be incomplete; <strong>tacit</strong> knowledge matters, too, and it is for the most part <strong>lodged</strong> in the minds of very busy people.</p><p>Under pandemic conditions accessing what those people know will be complicated by the fact that they may well be on the edge of burnout. Mr Bancel says his team “has been working hard for a year, seven days a week…we are not even finished doing all the tech transfer to deliver the billion for this year.” Every day he worries that he is pushing them too close to their breaking point.</p><p>The non-mrna Western firms have been working just as hard at transferring their technology. AstraZeneca made global production of its adenovirus vaccine a particular focus; the tech transfer of Oxford University vaccine taken forward by AstraZeneca to one British production site took about seven months, says Sandy Douglas, the Oxford professor who managed the transfer. Novavax has taken the better part of a year to transfer the insect-cell-based manufacturing system for its not-yet approved protein-subunit vaccine to the Serum Institute of India (sii), a huge and very experienced vaccine-maker. Stan Erck, the company’s ceo, says it is repeating the process in the Czech Republic, Korea, Japan and America.</p><p>All told, pharma firms have made 280 partnership contracts covering the production of covid-19 vaccines, says Thomas Cueni, head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, a trade group. About three-quarters of those deals involve technology transfer. He adds that the firms that are doing well in terms of meeting production targets tend to have relatively few production sites, pointing to the benefits centralisation offers attempts to scale up.</p><p>Biobags and bottlenecks<br>Despite all this activity, though, some companies which could be making vaccines are not. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, an established Israeli generic-medicine maker, has failed to reach a co-production deal with any covid-19-vaccine-maker. At the end of April it said it had stopped trying. Incepta, a Bangladeshi firm with the capacity to fill and finish hundreds of millions of vaccine vials a year, has also complained that it has been unable to interest producers in its services.</p><p>Given the constraints on expansion, it is vital that the supply chains on which current production rests be kept in fine <strong>fettle</strong>. “The number one priority today must be to do everything that we can to ramp up raw materials and get them to the production centres,” says the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, a trade group. Unfortunately, production has been slowed at various facilities by insufficient supplies of biobags (the containers in which vaccines are often made), tubing, filters and growth media for cells. Novavax’s lines in both Britain and India have been hit by shortages, at times coming to a halt; the company’s production plans have been set back significantly.</p><p>On April 16th the trouble with the Indian line led to a remarkable tweet. Adar Poonawalla, the head of sii, begged President Biden—“Respected @potus”—“to lift the <strong>embargo</strong> of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up”. At issue was America’s Defence Production Act (dpa), which grants the president broad industrial-mobilisation powers. The government is using the dpa to prioritise domestic firms’ orders for material and equipment used in vaccine production over those flooding in from other countries. Overseas producers who depend on American equipment or materials are feeling the pinch.</p><p>The sii said difficulties in getting materials from America were putting an AstraZeneca line at risk, as well as the Novavax one; between them they have a capacity of 160m-170m doses a month. On April 26th Tim Manning, the White House’s supply co-ordinator for covid-19, defended the use of the dpa, saying it is not a “de facto ban” on export and does not create supply shortages. But Biovac, a South African vaccine-maker, told Reuters that its American supplier of biobags was explicitly blaming the dpa for a 14 month <strong>backlog</strong> on biobag deliveries. Last year a number of big pharma firms started re-creating supply chains outside America to serve international customers. The sii Novavax line is still running at a fraction of its full capacity.</p><p>Disruptions to supply chains, whether down to the dpa or other factors, are a source of deep frustration. “Why on earth is production at the Serum Institute being delayed because it can’t get enough <strong>culture media</strong>?” asks Dr Douglas. “It’s madness! Is it because the company that makes culture media has a shortage of its own? If so let’s fix that.” Such problems have a worrying tendency to amplify themselves; when companies have concerns about supply chains they stockpile supplies, stressing the chains even more. The fact that some of the equipment needed for vaccine-making also plays a part in the production of considerably <strong>higher-margin</strong> products such as cancer treatments further complicates the situation, breeding suspicion.</p><p>Despite the supply difficulties, Airfinity says that current roll-out forecasts suggest that the America, Britain, Canada, the eu and Japan will have enough doses for their entire adult populations between the summer of 2021 and January 2022. But middle- and low-income countries are at risk. Donors have committed money to covax, but it has not been getting the vaccines it is meant to buy. Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general at the World Health Organisation (who), says covax hopes to have the j&amp;j adenovirus vaccine by June but “who knows, it is at risk for a million reasons so maybe June, maybe July, maybe August”. Of the 40m doses that Pfizer has promised, he says, it has delivered only 960,000. There was, though, some good news for covax on May 7th, when Sinopharm’s vaccine was given emergency-use authorisation by the who. This means that the vaccine, one of two inactivated-virus formulations being made in bulk by China, can now be distributed through covax.</p><p>Some countries have promised to donate doses to covax, but the volumes are small. Spain and New Zealand, the most generous, have pledged 1.6m and 7.5m doses respectively. The organisation has so far dealt with just 100,000 donated doses, provided by France and dispatched to Mauritania, says Dr Aylward. Rasmus Bech Hansen, boss of Airfinity, says he hears that the large purchase orders made by some governments may be resold rather than donated. The possibility of donations could be further <strong>dampened</strong> by a perceived need for booster shots as new variants spread.</p><p>Fail better<br>Bottlenecks in supply and hold-ups in distribution have led to calls for a fresh round of state investment. Public Citizen, an American consumer-advocacy group, says that with $25bn the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a part of America’s Department of Health which comes up with solutions to health emergencies, could scale up vaccine production enough to cut years off the tail of the pandemic. The money would be spent on stimulating production all the way along the supply chain, on technology transfer and on the construction of new facilities around the world. All of those people that The Economist spoke to who work in the existing vaccine-supply chain agreed that this was one <strong>sure-fire</strong> way to boost vaccine output yet further. The second-best time will always be now.</p>]]></content>
