Such stuff is so <strong>wound into</strong> the <strong>warp and weft</strong> of life that it is <strong>simultaneously</strong> both essential and taken for granted. One piece of infrastructure which has become critical over recent decades, though, is anything but earthbound. This is the various <strong>constellations</strong> of satellites, the most familiar of which is probably America’s Global Positioning System (gps), that orbit about 20,000km above Earth, broadcasting to the world precisely where they are and exactly what time it is.</p><p>The original purpose of the gps and its European (Galileo), Russian (glonass) and Chinese (BeiDou) counterparts was to enable suitably programmed receivers on or near the ground to calculate their whereabouts to within a few centimetres, by comparing signals from several satellites. In this role they have become <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, running everything from the navigation systems of planes, ships and automobiles, both military and civilian, to guiding the application of water and fertiliser in precision agriculture. But global-navigation satellite systems (gnss), to give their collective name, now do much more than that. By acting as clocks that broadcast the time accurate to within a few dozen nanoseconds, they are crucial to jobs ranging from co-ordinating electricity grids and mobile-phone networks to time-stamping financial transactions and regulating the flow of information in and out of data centres.</p><p>Location, location, location<br>gnss networks do, though, have a weak spot. The satellites’ transmitters broadcast with the <strong>wattage</strong> of a refrigerator lightbulb. Their signals are so vanishingly faint that they arrive “beneath the noise floor” of <strong>ambient</strong> electromagnetic radiation, as engineers like to put it. This makes them vulnerable to interference, both accidental and deliberate. The more uses which gnss constellations are put to, the more this matters. So those engineers are looking at ways to harden and back up the whole idea.</p><p>Jamming sometimes happens accidentally. In January, for instance, it emerged that gps failures which had been plaguing aircraft near Wilmington International Airport, in North Carolina, were caused by wireless equipment at an unnamed nearby utility. gnss networks are also vulnerable to “natural” jamming by the arrival from the sun of coronal-mass ejections of electrically charged particles. Most often, though, jamming is deliberate.</p><p>Local problems can be caused by personal privacy jammers (ppjs). These are devices—widely available for sale even though generally illegal to use—which scramble gps signals to stop vehicles being tracked by nosy employers or suspicious spouses. Thieves also find them useful. They are, for example, involved in 85% of vehicle thefts in Mexico.</p><p>Further up the commercially available scale are wide-area jammers. These devices, which are about the size of suitcases, do have legitimate quasi-civilian uses, such as protecting potential targets, public or private, from attack by gnss-guided drones or missiles. But misused, whether deliberately or accidentally, they can disrupt gnss across an area the size of a city. In this context it is notable that the northern Black Sea, where many Russian bigwigs, supposedly including the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, have country estates, is a hot-spot for gnss outages that affect shipping in the area.</p><p>At the high end of gnss disruptors are military systems, which can <strong>muddle</strong> signals for hundreds of kilometres around. <strong>Collateral</strong> effects from these are a growing problem. A paper published in March by Eurocontrol, an air-traffic-control body based in Brussels, noted a “massive rise” in gnss interference reported by airline pilots. In 2019 the number of recorded incidents reached 3,564—nearly 22 times more than had been noted two years previously. Most hotspots were near war zones. But long-range jammers are also used deliberately for low-level “<strong>asymmetric</strong>” warfare. South Korea’s capital, Seoul, for instance, often experiences gnss outages for which the only plausible explanation is jamming from North Korea, the border with which is only about 40km away.</p><p>All this jamming, both actual and conceivable, together with the more subtle problem of <strong>spoofing</strong>, in which <strong>bogus</strong> gnss signals are generated to confuse navigation systems, has led to a search for alternative, more robust means of geolocation and time-stamping. In America that search has been reinforced by the National Defence Authorisation Act, which became law on January 1st. This obliges the country’s armed forces to generate “resilient and survivable” positioning and timing capabilities by 2023.</p><p>One approach to doing so is to upgrade the satellites themselves. America’s air force, for example, has begun launching a generation of new “gps III” satellites built by Lockheed Martin, a defence giant. The first of these began transmissions in January. gps III offers somewhat stronger signals than its predecessor. But its main advantage is an encryption system, the details of which remain <strong>classified</strong>, that makes those signals more resistant to jamming. Both of these features will help military users. They will, however, be of less use to civilians, who will not be able to benefit from the encryption.</p><p>Signalling for help<br>Private enterprise is, however, coming to the rescue of those who are willing to pay for reliable geolocation and time stamping by pressing alternative satellite networks into service. Satelles, a firm in Virginia, is using Iridium, a constellation of 66 satellites orbiting at an altitude of just 800km, to re-broadcast encrypted time data sent from a network of high-precision clocks on the ground, together with data about the satellites’ locations (thus <strong>mimicking</strong> the functions of a gnss network), to clients including telecommunication firms, data centres, stock exchanges and banks.</p><p>The timekeeping and positioning data offered by Satelles’ system are, respectively, a little, and notably less, precise than gnss. But because Iridium satellites orbit at a mere 25th of the altitude of gnss constellations, the signals from them are more than 1,000 times stronger, thus shortening jammers’ effective ranges. Satelles’ clients are concentrated in America. That, says Michael O’Connor, the firm’s boss, is where the <strong>realisation</strong>, “oh shoot, we need backups”, has taken greatest hold. He says, though, that if Satelles had clients in Seoul, they would continue to receive signals during North Korea’s periodic jamming of the city.</p><p>Spoofing can be made harder, too. A Belgian firm called Septentrio is designing anti-spoofing antennae that can distinguish signals which have come from the sky, and thus carry tiny distortions imposed by the <strong>ionosphere</strong>, from cleaner ones generated nearby on the ground as spoofs. Septentrio’s <strong>wizardry</strong> relies on hardware in the form of a complex array of conductors and insulators inside the antennae. But software can do the job as well. America’s Department of Homeland Security recently released a set of algorithms intended to help signal engineers develop anti-spoofing programs, and Galileo’s masters are testing, with help from Septentrio, what is intended to become a publicly available anti-spoofing encryption service called Open Service Navigation Message Authentication, or osnma.</p><p>The securest approach of all, though, is surprisingly old-fashioned. It is to back gnss up with systems on the ground. And the development of cheap, reliable atomic clocks makes this increasingly possible.</p><p>Light the beacons<br>Orolia, a French firm that makes such clocks for satellites, reports high demand for a line of ground-based versions called <strong>miniaturised</strong> rubidium <strong>oscillators</strong>, which went on sale last June. These have half the volume of a pack of cigarettes, so are widely deployable. According to Thierry Delhomme, Orolia’s European general manager, they typically drift less than a microsecond per day. That is not bad for a unit sold for a few thousand dollars (as opposed to the $1.5m cost of the best clocks used in satellites), and would certainly tide a user over a temporary outage. But anything more than a day or two and even one of these new devices would get sufficiently out of synch with reality to cause trouble.</p><p>opnt, a Dutch company, has another idea. This is to deliver the precise time as signal pulses sent through fibre-optic cables, rather than by satellite. That could be done using existing fibre-optic networks, by isolating one strand within a cable and dedicating it to the purpose.</p><p>To turn the clock back properly, however, some people are trying to revive the idea of land-based navigation beacons similar to the Loran (long-range navigation) towers used by the American and British navies during the second world war. According to George Shaw of the General Lighthouse Authorities of the uk and Ireland, which runs the British Isles’ coastal-navigation system, several countries are now constructing enhanced “eLoran” networks. These include China, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. And, on a smaller scale, private enterprise is interested, too. NextNav, a firm based in Silicon Valley, is building in San Francisco a network of about 100 small beacons that will broadcast timing and position signals around the city. This network’s density, and the fact that it can draw power from the grid rather than relying, as gnss satellites do, on solar panels, means that the signals are roughly 100,000 times stronger than those from such a satellite—and thus hard to jam or spoof.</p><p><a id="the-oldest-burial-in-africa"></a></p><h1 id="The-oldest-burial-in-Africa"><a href="#The-oldest-burial-in-Africa" class="headerlink" title="The oldest burial in Africa"></a>The oldest burial in Africa</h1><p>A cave in Kenya is the resting place of a 78,000-year-old child<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>These are the are the remains of an infant Homo <strong>sapiens</strong>, nicknamed Mtoto by their discoverers, found buried in Panga ya Saidi, a complex of caves near Mombasa, Kenya, in 2013. They are 78,000 years old, making them the most ancient human burial yet unearthed in Africa. The lefthand group of bones are the child’s spine and <strong>thorax</strong>; those to the right, the skull and some <strong>vertebrae</strong>. They were excavated and analysed by a team led by researchers from the National Museums of Kenya and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, in Jena, Germany, who published their findings in this week’s Nature. Mtoto, whose sex cannot be determined but whose name means “child” in Swahili, was about three years old. That the burial was deliberate seems clear. The skeleton was in a circular pit and the child is thought, from the way the bones were arranged, to have been laid out with its head on a pillow.</p><p><a id="roadkill-provide-a-novel-way-to-sample-an-area%E2%80%99s-animals"></a></p><h1 id="Roadkill-provide-a-novel-way-to-sample-an-area’s-animals"><a href="#Roadkill-provide-a-novel-way-to-sample-an-area’s-animals" class="headerlink" title="Roadkill provide a novel way to sample an area’s animals"></a>Roadkill provide a novel way to sample an area’s animals</h1><p>They could also show the places where wildlife is most at risk from cars<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Traffic and wildlife do not mix. Anyone who keeps an eye on the verges while driving along a country road knows that. But such carnage does bring zoologists an opportunity. Counting roadkills is a rough and ready way of sampling local animal populations, and is the basis of so-called citizen-science endeavours such as Project Splatter, in Britain, in which members of the public report what they have found dead on the road, and where.</p><p>Pablo Medrano Vizcaíno and Santiago Espinosa at the Catholic University of Ecuador, however, have taken the matter further by going out to look for themselves. And, as they report in Biotropica, monitoring roadkill can yield information about creatures that are otherwise almost completely elusive.</p><p>Once a week, for six months, Mr Medrano Vizcaíno and Dr Espinosa surveyed three 33km segments of roads weaving in and around tropical forests and mountains near the Ecuadorian national parks of Cayambe Coca and Sumaco Napo-Galeras. Every time they came across a dead animal they stopped, photographed it, noted its gps co-ordinates and identified it as accurately as possible. If they could not manage a field identification, they collected the carcass and brought it back to their laboratory for further study.</p><p>In total, they found 445 specimens. Some, such as the 153 opossums, were the sorts of large critter that the average passer-by might notice. But many were not. There were, for instance, 43 amphibians. Frogs are common in tropical forests, but by and large these were not frogs. Rather, some 80% of them were caecilians, a little-understood group of wormlike burrowing animals. Ecuador harbours 24 species of caecilian. Exactly which of them were represented in the researchers’ collection is hazy, as individual species require specialist identification. But studying roadkill might be a way of adding to knowledge about them.</p><p>More extraordinary than this, among the 88 reptiles seen by Mr Medrano Vizcaíno and Dr Espinosa, one was a snake previously unknown to science. They also found an example of the northern tiger cat, a species thought to be on the brink of extinction.</p><p>A sampling method that relies on finding endangered animal species dead is obviously suboptimal. But Mr Medrano Vizcaíno and Dr Espinosa hope that one outcome of their work might be to identify roadkill hotspots, and then try to find ways to discourage animals from going there.</p><p>That could, though, be tricky. The data they have collected so far suggest these hotspots are often bridges over rivers. If the creatures themselves are using these as crossing-points, deterring them from doing so might be difficult.</p><p><a id="a-blood-test-may-help-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-depression"></a></p><h1 id="A-blood-test-may-help-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-depression"><a href="#A-blood-test-may-help-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-depression" class="headerlink" title="A blood test may help the diagnosis and treatment of depression"></a>A blood test may help the diagnosis and treatment of depression</h1><p>Snippets of RNA are the giveaways<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Major depression is a serious illness, but also an elusive one. It wrecks lives and may drive people to suicide. It sometimes, though not always, alternates with periods of mania in a condition called bipolar disorder. And it is disturbingly common. Reliable figures are hard to come by, but in some parts of the world as many as one person in four experiences major depression at some point during their life.</p><p>Depression’s diagnosis has, though, a worryingly arbitrary quality to it, depending as it does on a doctor’s assessment of a patient’s mood against a checklist of symptoms which may be present in different combinations and are often, in any case, subjective. This has led to a search for reliable biochemical markers of the illness. Not only might these assist diagnosis, they may also improve assessments of prognosis and point towards the most effective treatment in a particular case. Now, a group of neuroscientists at Indiana University, in Indianapolis, led by Alexander Niculescu, think they have found a set of markers that can do all this.</p><p>As they write in Molecular Psychiatry, Dr Niculescu and his colleagues have been working with data and blood samples collected over the course of 15 years from hundreds of patients at the Indianapolis Veterans Administration Medical Centre. The targets of their investigation were small pieces of rna, a molecule similar to dna which is copied from the dna of genes as part of the process by which the information encoded in those genes is used by cells to make proteins.</p><p>Tracking levels in the blood of relevant rna molecules shows the activity of the underlying genes. That let the researchers identify, in an initial sample of 44 patients’ records, which genes were becoming more and less active as people’s mood disorders waxed and waned. To start with, they found thousands of possible candidate genes in this way, but they first narrowed these down to those that seemed to show the best prediction of mood and then, by turning to the corpus of published research on genes associated with depression, narrowed the selection still further to 26 that had previously been suspected of involvement in the illness. They then followed this clutch up in eight groups of patients, ranging in size from 97 to 226, to see which best predicted the course and details of a patient’s illness.</p><p>Thirteen markers survived this final winnowing. The genes they represent are involved in a range of activities, including running circadian rhythms (the endogenous clocks which keep bodily activities synchronised with each other and with the daily cycle of light and darkness); regulating levels in the brain of a messenger molecule called serotonin, the activity of which is well known to get out of kilter in depression; responding to stress; metabolising glucose to release energy; and signalling within cells.</p><p>Together, these 13 rna markers form the basis of a blood test that can not only diagnose depression, but also predict who will go on to develop bipolar disorder, who is likely to become ill enough to need hospital treatment in the future, and which drugs will most probably be effective in particular cases. Six of the rnas were good predictors of depression alone. Another six predicted both depression and mania. One predicted mania alone.</p><p>On top of their potential role in diagnosis, three of the genes identified are known from previous work to be affected by lithium carbonate, an established treatment for bipolar disorder, and two others are affected by a class of antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, of which Prozac is probably the best-known example. It is for this reason that Dr Niculescu thinks his blood test may help to pick appropriate treatments.</p><p>Tests of reason<br>The results even indicate some non-psychiatric drugs that might be worth trying, since the analysis showed they had characteristics which could affect some of the biomarkers. A beta blocker called Pindolol, for example, is currently used to treat high blood pressure. But this drug is also known to affect serotonin activity, and Dr Niculescu and his colleagues found, from a search of the published literature, that it has been seen to affect levels of all six of the depression-only biomarkers. That, he thinks, might make it a good candidate for the treatment of depression.</p><p>To turn all this into practical help for patients, Dr Niculescu and his colleague and co-author Anantha Shekhar have founded a company called MindX Sciences and are seeking regulatory approval for the test’s medical use. If all goes well, future versions might incorporate additional biomarkers, and might use saliva rather than blood as the fluid sampled. Biomarker-diagnosis of depression is unlikely to replace assessment by checklist, which would still be needed to see who should be sent for screening in the first place. But as a way of confirming and refining diagnoses, and also of suggesting treatment in what is both an uncertain and a sensitive area, it seems an important advance.</p><p><a id="knitting-a-road-with-stones-and-string"></a></p><h1 id="Knitting-a-road-with-stones-and-string"><a href="#Knitting-a-road-with-stones-and-string" class="headerlink" title="Knitting a road with stones and string"></a>Knitting a road with stones and string</h1><p>Greener road-building<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Since the Romans began doing it with great panache more than 2,000 years ago, road-building has been a sweaty, grubby business, involving heaving great quantities of rocks and stones into place and, in more recent times, covering the surface with asphalt or concrete. Now a group of Swiss researchers think they have come up with a more elegant solution. Strange as it may seem, this involves knitting.</p><p>Martin Arraigada and Saeed Abbasion of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology use a robotic arm to lay out string in a series of elaborate patterns. As the knitting takes shape, layers of stones are added and tamped down. The string entangles the stones, keeping them in place. The result is a structure that is surprisingly stable and strong. In one experiment a section of pavement put together in this way withstood a load of half a tonne. The encapsulated stones hardly moved at all.</p><p>Roads and pavements are usually made from layers of different grades of sand, gravel and stones. Once these are in place the surface is treated with an aggregate that is sealed and bound together with cement to form concrete, or mixed with bitumen to make asphalt. Neither method is environmentally friendly. Making cement produces huge amounts of carbon dioxide, while bitumen, a sticky tar-like substance, is obtained from oil.</p><p>Knitting roads creates fewer emissions. And the stones and string are easily recyclable, says Dr Arraigada. The group tried various materials for the string, settling eventually on recycled textiles reinforced with polyester, a type of plastic. Polyester resists rotting and can also be recycled, although the group hope to find biological materials which can do the same job.</p><p>They got the idea of knitting roads from work carried out by the Gramazio Kohler architectural research group at eth, a university in Zurich. In one of this group’s projects, led by Gergana Rusenova, now at Swinburne University of Technology, in Australia, a Stonehenge-like structure with 11 columns was built in a similar way. A mobile robot, which moved on caterpillar tracks, laid down 120km of string in geometric patterns while 30 tonnes of crushed stones were added. The resulting three-metre-high columns comfortably supported a nine-tonne capping stone.</p><p>There is, though, some way to go before knitted roads become a commercial proposition, cautions Dr Arraigada. He and his colleagues are testing various set-ups and modelling on a computer how different patterns of string can be used to hold the stones. They will then carry out more tests—including ones that apply the sorts of rolling pressure generated by the wheels of moving vehicles.</p><p>Concrete and asphalt road surfaces are usually impervious to water, and are shaped so that rain flows off them into gutters running alongside. If water gets caught in surface cracks, it can cause potholes—especially if it freezes and thereby expands, opening up more cracks. Binding aggregates with string would produce a permeable road surface, which might result in fewer potholes. It might have other advantages, too. The researchers think, for example, that a porous road could help water reach the subsoil below, reducing the impact that covering so much land with roads has on local hydrology. Just like knitting a nice cardigan, success will depend on starting with a good pattern.<br><a id="a-masterful-director-brings-dostoyevsky%E2%80%99s-characters-to-life"></a></p><h1 id="A-masterful-director-brings-Dostoyevsky’s-characters-to-life"><a href="#A-masterful-director-brings-Dostoyevsky’s-characters-to-life" class="headerlink" title="A masterful director brings Dostoyevsky’s characters to life"></a>A masterful director brings Dostoyevsky’s characters to life</h1><p>For Lev Dodin, as for the author, Alyosha is the most important of “The Brothers Karamazov”<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Aspotlight searches the dark stage of the Maly Drama Theatre in St Petersburg. It picks out a young man in a monk’s robe sitting on a chair, a suitcase on his lap. He rises, changes into secular clothes and steps towards a metal wall. The wall, in turn, moves towards the character; he passes through it, as if being x-rayed, and into the world of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s final novel, “The Brothers Karamazov”.</p><p>The monk is Alyosha, youngest of the three legitimate sons of Fyodor Karamazov, an avaricious “buffoon” who wallows in sin and is murdered by one—or more—or all—of his offspring. Karamazov has a fourth, illegitimate son, Smerdyakov, an epileptic servant whose mother, a homeless halfwit, he raped. The story of patricide has the outline of a country-house murder mystery. But in what became one of the world’s most influential novels, Dostoyevsky, who was born 200 years ago in 1821, weaves in profound themes of faith, temptation and inherited guilt.</p><p>Of the three brothers, readers usually sympathise most with Dmitry, the impulsive, passionate and archetypally Russian eldest, or Ivan, a cold, rational Westernised intellectual who repudiates God before going insane and conversing with the devil. Alyosha, a blushing monk who shuttles between the brothers and their lovers, carrying messages and receiving confessions, can seem too wholesome to vie with his siblings for attention.</p><p>Yet in a short introduction it is Alyosha whom Dostoyevsky names as his main character. Lev Dodin, one of Europe’s greatest theatre directors, agrees. “The introduction is perhaps the most important part of the novel for me,” he says. Marking the author’s bicentenary, his production distils the 1,000-page saga into a three-hour spectacle, sweeping audiences from breathless passion to the darkest recesses of the human condition. A gripping reimagining of an elemental tale, it evokes traumas fictional and real, in Dostoyevsky’s era and today’s. And here, sweet, devout Alyosha is the greatest sinner of all.</p><p>Set in the mid-19th century, “The Brothers Karamazov”, wrote Dostoyevsky, was only the first part of a “life-chronicle” of Alyosha. “The principal novel is the second—an account of my hero’s doings in our own times, that is to say, at our present-day current moment.” The book was published in 1880; Dostoyevsky died that winter and never revealed what happens to Alyosha in the “present day”. According to some accounts, the character was to become a revolutionary and help kill the tsar before being executed himself.</p><p>Neither did Dostoyevsky live to see the real-life assassination of a tsar later in 1881 or the murder of another during the Russian revolution. But his anguished writing is widely thought to have anticipated the horrors of the 20th century. Mr Dodin, who was born in 1944 into a Jewish family that had fled the siege of Leningrad, has lived and worked in their shadows. Four years in the making, his version of “The Brothers Karamazov” is less an adaptation than an engrossing conversation with an author who has preoccupied him all his life. Almost all the words come from Dostoyevsky, but the arrangement is Mr Dodin’s. In that opening sequence, he places Alyosha in the “current moment”, then sends him back into the world of the novel.</p><p>Alyosha’s father and brothers emerge from beneath the stage, as though brought back from the dead. A timeless heap of old chairs in the corner are the principal props. Mr Dodin dispenses with many of the book’s characters, retaining only the men of the Karamazov household and two women who are the source and subject of love, lechery and hatred. Stripped down to its essence, this is strictly a family affair, the looming sense of an ancestral curse recalling Greek tragedy. There is no small talk. Played by the virtuoso actors of Mr Dodin’s regular ensemble, the characters get straight down to business. “Have you come to save the world? I don’t think that is possible,” Ivan tells Alyosha.</p><p>Not only will Alyosha fail to save the world; in the play, at least, he discovers that it is not worth saving. He learns that all these people who profess to live, die and kill for love in fact love nobody. As for himself, “the more I love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular.” He is the ultimate Karamazov brother, he realises, the embodiment of all three in one. “It is not that I rebel against my God,” he says, echoing Ivan’s views, “but I don’t accept and can’t accept the world He has created.” Alyosha gives in to temptation, convulsing in shame and ecstasy when Grushenka—his brother Dmitry’s mistress and the object of his father’s lust—seduces him.</p><p>“I am the same as you in kind,” he tells Dmitry, who observes this scene. “The ladder’s the same. I’m at the bottom step, and you’re above…Anyone on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.” Virtue is merely a mirage, and unbridled human nature can divert even the best intentions. Afterwards, Alyosha sits between Grushenka’s spread legs, the tableau suggesting a sexual clinch but at the same time, shockingly, resembling an icon of the Madonna. As Mr Dodin summarises, in this story, “people don’t just talk about Hell”. They are living in it.</p><p>Dressed in period costumes, Mr Dodin’s characters make no explicit comment on contemporary Russian politics. But as with all great art, the production is a cardiogram of its time, registering modern Russia’s rhythms and defects. Dostoyevsky, says Mr Dodin, is always an inescapable presence, “but today he is screaming”, amid “the crushing of humanism, the cliff-edge of despair”. The life unfolding on stage pulsates with energy. Equally, the world of the play is devoid of kindness or mercy.</p><p>Into the darkness<br>The contrast with another celebrated production is telling. In 1910 the Moscow Art Theatre, under the brilliant leadership of Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, put on a version of “The Brothers Karamazov” that spread over two evenings. Hailed as a milestone in Russian cultural life, it captured a widespread premonition of cataclysm yet was filled with compassion. Critics likened it to an epic mystery play. “The spirit of God is in the air,” thought Alexandre Benois, a writer and artist, who was reminded of ecclesiastical light and Easter bells. For Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, the story “opened the door not so much to Greek tragedy, but to the Bible”.</p><p>Mr Dodin reveres their theatre and shares its aim of excavating the truth. But he does not open any biblical doors. There are no Easter bells. There is no God and no devil here, “only destiny”, as Smerdyakov says when confessing to finishing off old Karamazov. Doubling as a suicide-note, his speech is addressed as much to the audience as to his brothers: “You are very clever. You are fond of money, you are far too fond of female charms, and you mind most of all about living in undisturbed comfort.”</p><p>His eyes glistening, Alyosha gets the last word. “Everyone is guilty,” he proclaims, in a rare interpolation by Mr Dodin.</p><p>//I am more guilty than all. I want to burn this city. I will set it ablaze and watch. No: I will set it ablaze and burn with it, because I am this city.</p><p>Through the alchemy of Mr Dodin’s craft, the bleakness is offset by the vitality of the performance, which culminates in a dance that sweeps up the other characters and carries them offstage. Left alone, Alyosha passes back through the wall. The spotlight is turned off. </p><p><a id="puzzles-and-power-games-in-rachel-cusk%E2%80%99s-new-novel"></a></p><h1 id="Puzzles-and-power-games-in-Rachel-Cusk’s-new-novel"><a href="#Puzzles-and-power-games-in-Rachel-Cusk’s-new-novel" class="headerlink" title="Puzzles and power games in Rachel Cusk’s new novel"></a>Puzzles and power games in Rachel Cusk’s new novel</h1><p>Intermittently baffling, “Second Place” is also oddly compelling<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Second Place. By Rachel Cusk. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; 192 pages; $25. Faber; £14.99</p><p>“Ionce told you, Jeffers, about the time I met the devil on a train leaving Paris.” Rachel Cusk’s latest novel, “Second Place”, begins with this arresting recollection. At the end of the book a brief note informs readers that it “owes a debt to ‘Lorenzo in Taos’, Mabel Dodge Luhan’s 1932 memoir of the time D.H. Lawrence came to stay with her in Taos, New Mexico”. It is not necessary to be familiar with this antecedent, however, to enjoy the oddly compelling (if intermittently baffling) story that Ms Cusk tells in the pages in between.</p><p>Only ever referred to as M, the narrator is living happily with her second husband Tony “in a place of great but subtle beauty” in an unnamed country. It is 15 years after she encountered the devil (Jeffers, to whom she confides this hallucinatory experience, is her implied interlocutor throughout). Ms Cusk keeps the details of the landscape vague but the “woolly marsh” does not sound like New Mexico. M invites L, a painter and a friend of a friend, to stay at her “second place”, a cottage M and Tony have built on their land.</p><p>“Second place” also sums up how M feels about her own life: “it had been a near miss, requiring just as much effort as victory but with that victory always and forever somehow denied me.” Why she feels this way is never exactly elucidated, but L’s presence seems set to help. Tellingly, M saw his paintings just before her demonic visitation on the train.</p><p>The power games begin when L accepts M’s invitation, only to change his mind; when at last he does materialise he brings along a gorgeous young girlfriend, Brett, whom he hadn’t mentioned. M’s attempt to confront him over this leaves her feeling “acutely conscious of my own unattractiveness, as I would in all my dealings with L”. His arrival also means that M has to turf Justine, her 21-year-old daughter, and Justine’s boyfriend Kurt out of the second place and back into the main house with her.</p><p>The three couples circle each other uneasily. Individuals form surprising alliances; Kurt warns M that L “says he intends to destroy you”. The dread that is evoked forms the basis of a plot, a feature that was missing from the author’s much-praised but dreamlike “Outline” trilogy of autofictional novels. Her prose, though, is again as spare as bone. M envies the “aura of male freedom” in L’s work—and in delineating these frustrations so piercingly, Ms Cusk’s allusive and elusive story makes its own unorthodox claim to freedom.</p><p><a id="albrecht-d%C3%BCrer-lived-in-a-world-of-wonders"></a></p><h1 id="Albrecht-Durer-lived-in-a-world-of-wonders"><a href="#Albrecht-Durer-lived-in-a-world-of-wonders" class="headerlink" title="Albrecht Dürer lived in a world of wonders"></a>Albrecht Dürer lived in a world of wonders</h1><p>They inspired his art, which in turn has inspired his admirers for centuries<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Albert and the Whale. By Philip Hoare. Pegasus Books; 304 pages; $28.95. Fourth Estate; £16.99</p><p>Marvels were commonplace in Albrecht Dürer’s world. As Philip Hoare writes in his captivating study of the German artist, the potentates of early 16th-century Europe traded wonders like playing cards. Erik Walkendorf, an archbishop in Norway, presented Pope Leo X with “the head of a walrus, salted in a barrel like a dead admiral”. Meanwhile, a Portuguese ambassador sent a rhino from India to his king in Lisbon, who tired of his pet and passed it on to the pope. En route to Rome, the ship sank in the Ligurian Sea; shackled on deck, the animal went down with it.</p><p>Dürer probably never saw either creature. But his luminous sketches of them are among the works Mr Hoare considers in “Albert and the Whale”. More slippery than a straight biography, the book instead swoops cormorant-like into Dürer’s life and times. Above all, Mr Hoare is interested in the afterlives of Dürer’s art in the five centuries since his death. It enraptured William Blake, Herman Melville and Oscar Wilde and inspired Thomas Mann’s novel “Doctor Faustus”.</p><p>He was born in Nuremberg in 1471. His Europe, explains Mr Hoare, was both recognisable and deeply alien. It was “a place of taxes and printing presses”, but an ordinary person could expect to see fewer human-made images in a lifetime than today’s internet mavens encounter in a minute. Dürer was perhaps its first internationally recognised artist, seizing on the new technologies of woodcuts and printing to market his sizeable body of work—100 paintings, 300 prints and over 1,000 drawings. He mechanised his genius.</p><p>Mr Hoare’s portrait glitters with arresting details. He recounts a visit Dürer made to the Archduchess Margaret of Austria to sue for her patronage. He was deterred by her retinue, which included a greyhound, a green parrot and a beady-eyed marmoset. Her habit of displaying the embalmed heart of her late husband, a Spanish prince, as a charm may also have put him off.</p><p>“Dürer was living on the edge of new revelations, a world shifting nervously in space,” Mr Hoare writes. In 1493 Christopher Columbus returned from the New World; 50 years later Copernicus published his heliocentric theory of the cosmos. Yet death and disease were incessant. Dürer saw the sky shot through with blood-red streaks, “auguries of the plague”. His woodcuts of the end times were bestsellers. Apocalypse crackled in the air.</p><p>In his previous writing, on subjects including “Moby Dick”, Mr Hoare pioneered a hybrid style that merged memoir, biography and criticism. In “Albert and the Whale” he pushes this technique further than ever. His readings of Dürer’s work grow woozy with enthusiasm, dissolving into a kind of modernist poetry. Readers who prefer their art history to have both feet on the ground might be unmoored; others will be intoxicated.</p><p>Dürer died in 1528, aged 56. Eight years earlier he travelled to the fen country of Zeeland in search of a stranded whale. The animal vanished before he arrived. Instead he caught “a strange illness”, possibly malaria, which would shorten his life. Still, his journey to that haunting landscape fired his art. “Zeeland is wonderful to see because of the water,” he wrote. “The great ships sail about as if on the fields.” Even then, Dürer saw marvels. </p><p><a id="blame-politics-for-disasters-says-niall-ferguson-in-%E2%80%9Cdoom%E2%80%9D"></a></p><h1 id="Blame-politics-for-disasters-says-Niall-Ferguson-in-“Doom”"><a href="#Blame-politics-for-disasters-says-Niall-Ferguson-in-“Doom”" class="headerlink" title="Blame politics for disasters, says Niall Ferguson in “Doom”"></a>Blame politics for disasters, says Niall Ferguson in “Doom”</h1><p>His new book is an elegant historical tour that lacks a convincing argument<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Doom. By Niall Ferguson. Penguin; 496 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25</p><p>Abook about “Doom” that in its first chapter quotes from “Dad’s Army”, “Beyond the Fringe” and Monty Python, all classics of British comedy, lifts a reviewer’s spirit. But although “The Politics of Catastrophe”, as Niall Ferguson’s latest work is subtitled, takes off with the pacey prose, grand historical sweep and fine detail for which the author is renowned, it does not live up to its early promise. In a big-idea book, which this aims to be, those scholarly and stylistic virtues need to serve a striking argument. That, sadly, is lacking.</p><p>Its central contention is that “all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens”. A society’s character, in other words—its resilience, fragility and ability to manage the fallout of catastrophe—determines the effect on it of even the most apparently natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and plagues.</p><p>This is the subject of the moment. Many factors shape the way a country copes with covid-19; some have yet to be identified. But its varying impact at least partly reflects societies’ different responses—and their underlying strengths and weaknesses. The world has, in effect, been set the same exam. Some places (Taiwan) have passed with flying colours, some (India) have failed dismally and most (America, Europe) could have done better.</p><p>But the set of disasters under consideration is key. If it is drawn narrowly enough to include only those that seem natural, such as pandemics, Mr Ferguson’s observation is interesting but not original. Amartya Sen, a Nobel-prizewinning economist, made it in 1981 in “Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation”; his perception that famine is caused not by crop failure but by politics made his name. If the set takes in the Titanic, the Challenger space shuttle, the war in Syria and a possible conflict with China, and if “politics” includes the way people and organisations work together—which is how Mr Ferguson defines both concepts—his main contention becomes a statement of the obvious. When bad things happen to humanity, humanity is largely to blame.</p><p>Mr Ferguson offers a wealth of deep research, some of it gripping—such as Thucydides’s account of the unravelling of ancient Athenian society after a plague, the reasons for the lifeboat shortage on the Titanic and the views of Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist, on the organisational causes of the Challenger disaster. But a book that ranges so widely needs a strong thread to hold it together. Here you may find yourself turning to the long chapter descriptions at the start to see why you are reading about the Battle of the Somme or the decline of the Ming dynasty. Whistle-stop tours of world history succeed if the itinerary plots an arresting case; “Doom” supplies the tour, but the reader is left wondering what the point of it is.</p><p>There is also a problem of timing. About a quarter of the book is about covid-19, which is presumably the reason why it was written. Perhaps Mr Ferguson wanted to get in before the competition, but he would have done better to wait. His account of the pandemic is a summary of the story up to last autumn; six months on, his perspective at times feels mistaken. He roundly condemns the American and British governments, praising not just the east Asians’ management of the disease but also the benefits of European transnational co-operation. “European institutions”, he writes, “rose to the challenge posed by covid-19.” That claim is less convincing now.</p><p>From within a somewhat misconceived book, a better one is trying to get out. Mr Ferguson’s chapter on the growing conflict between the West and China—“cold war II”, as he calls it—is forceful, coherent and angry. He dismisses the idea of “co-opetition” and believes that the best way of avoiding a real war is for Western countries to unite and confront Beijing. His prose is best when he is roused. He should write a book on China soon; it may prove more compelling than this one. </p><p><a id="the-real-reasons-some-languages-are-harder-to-learn"></a></p><h1 id="The-real-reasons-some-languages-are-harder-to-learn"><a href="#The-real-reasons-some-languages-are-harder-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="The real reasons some languages are harder to learn"></a>The real reasons some languages are harder to learn</h1><p>They slice up the messy reality of life differently from your own<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>When considering which foreign languages to study, some people shy away from those that use a different alphabet. Those random-looking squiggles seem to symbolise the impenetrability of the language, the difficulty of the task ahead.</p><p>So it can be surprising to hear devotees of Russian say the alphabet is the easiest part of the job. The Cyrillic script, like the Roman one, has its origins in the Greek alphabet. As a result, some letters look the same and are used near identically. Others look the same but have different pronunciations, like the p in Cyrillic, which stands for an r-sound. For Russian, that cuts the task down to only about 20 entirely new characters. These can comfortably be learned in a week, and soon mastered to the point that they present little trouble. An alphabet, in other words, is just an alphabet. A few tricks aside (such as the occasional omission of vowels), other versions do what the Roman one does: represent sounds.</p><p>Foreign languages really become hard when they have features that do not appear in your own—things you never imagined you would have to learn. Which is another way of saying that languages slice up the messy reality of experience in strikingly different ways.</p><p>This is easily illustrated with concrete vocabulary. Sometimes the meanings of foreign words and their English equivalents overlap but don’t match exactly. Danish, for instance, does not have a word for “wood”; it just uses “tree” (trae). Or consider colours, which lie on a spectrum that different languages segment differently. In Japanese, ao traditionally refers to both green and blue. Some green items are covered by a different word, midori, but ao applies to some vegetables and green traffic lights (which, to make matters more confusing, are slightly blueish in Japan). As a result, ao is rather tricky to wield.</p><p>Life becomes tougher still when other languages make distinctions that yours ignores. Russian splits blue into light (goluboi) and dark (sinii); foreigners can be baffled by what to call, say, a mid-blue pair of jeans. Plenty of other “basic” English words are similarly broken down in their foreign corollaries. “Wall” and “corner” seem like simple concepts, until you learn languages that sensibly distinguish between a city’s walls and a bedroom’s (German Mauer versus Wand), interior corners and street corners (Spanish rincón and esquina), and so on.</p><p>These problems are tractable on their own; you don’t often have to refer to a corner in casual conversation. But when other languages make structural distinctions missing from your native tongue—often in the operation of verbs—the mental effort seems never-ending. English has verbs-of-all-work that seem straightforward enough until you try to translate them. In languages like German, “put” is divided into verbs that signify hanging, laying something flat and placing something tall and thin. “Go” in Russian is a nightmare, with a suite of verbs distinguishing walking and travelling by vehicle, one-way and round trips, single and repeated journeys, and other niceties. You can specify all these things in English if you want to; the difference is that in Russian, you must.</p><p>Sometimes verb systems force choices on speakers not only for individual verbs, but for all of them. Many English-speakers are familiar with languages, such as French and Italian, which have two different past tenses, for completed actions and for habitual or continued ones. But verb systems get much more exotic than that.</p><p>“Evidential” languages require a verb ending that shows how the speaker knows that the statement made is true. Turkish is one of them; others, such as a cluster in the Amazon, have particularly complex—and obligatory—evidentiality rules. Many languages mark subjects and direct objects of sentences in distinct ways. But in Basque, subjects of intransitive verbs (those that take no direct object) look like direct objects themselves, while subjects of transitive verbs get a special form. If Martin catches sight of Diego, Basques say the equivalent of “Martinek sees Diego.”</p><p>In the end, the “hard” languages to learn are not those that do what your own language does in a new way. They are the ones that make you constantly pay attention to distinctions in the world that yours blithely passes over. It is a bit like a personal trainer putting you through entirely new exercises. You might have thought yourself fit before, but the next day you will wake up sore in muscles you never knew you had.</p>]]></content>

Organised through social media and calling themselves los indignados (“the indignant ones”), it was a new kind of protest movement, one that would be swiftly copied elsewhere, notably by Occupy Wall Street and Occupy London later that year.</p><p>Initially enjoying broad public support, the indignados shook Spain to the core. Within three years they helped to spawn two new national political parties, Podemos on the left and Ciudadanos on the centre-right. In 2015 these parties grabbed 34% of the vote between them. A stable political system long based on the Socialists and the conservative People’s Party (pp) fragmented. The result has been four general elections in the past six years, none of which has produced a majority government.</p><p>A decade on, Spain is in many ways a different country. The legacy of the indignados is <strong>palpable</strong> but far from straightforward. “May 15th was a great outburst of dismissal,” says Carolina Bescansa, a sociologist who took part and was one of the founders of Podemos. “The consensus was on what we didn’t want. We didn’t want more cuts, we didn’t want corruption and we didn’t want that way of doing politics behind the backs of citizens.”</p><p>On the first two points the movement achieved changes. Unlike the policy during the slump of 2008-12, Spain’s government has spent heavily to protect household income during the pandemic, partly thanks to more accommodating policies from the European Central Bank and the European Commission. “Corruption still exists but there’s no longer <strong>impunity</strong>,” says Ms Bescansa. Dozens of politicians and bankers have been jailed over the past decade. Banks treat people with <strong>mortgages</strong> better. The indignados also <strong>heralded</strong> a generational change, as new political leaders rose through the introduction of party primaries. At 49, Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist prime minister since 2018, is the oldest of the national party leaders.</p><p>But in other ways remaking Spanish politics has proved <strong>elusive</strong>. Last year Podemos entered government as the Socialists’ junior partner in Spain’s first coalition government since the 1930s. But Podemos itself has changed. It began as a broad left-<strong>populist</strong> outfit, with some similarities to Italy’s Five Star Movement. In 2015 its leader, Pablo Iglesias, hoped to displace the Socialists, just as Syriza, another <strong>insurgent</strong> party, did in Greece. Podemos peaked in 2016 when it won 21% of the vote. It has declined ever since, as Mr Iglesias ruthlessly <strong>sidelined</strong> his fellow leaders and <strong>mimicked</strong> the Communist Party, with which he allied. He stepped down as a deputy prime minister to run in Madrid’s regional election on May 4th, but did poorly. He then announced his resignation from politics.</p><p>The best chances of renewal were <strong>squandered</strong>. In 2016 the Socialists and Ciudadanos, with 130 of 350 parliamentary seats between them, agreed on a programme of political and economic reforms but were <strong>thwarted</strong> when others refused to let them govern. An election in April 2019 gave the two a combined majority of 180 seats. But Albert Rivera, Ciudadanos’s leader, had steered his party to the right and was set on a bid to displace the pp. It failed, too. Mr Sánchez showed no interest in wooing him. By then the two “detested each other”, writes Ramón González Férriz in a book on why regeneration failed.</p><p>“The opportunity for reform is no longer on the table,” says Pablo Simón of Carlos III University in Madrid. “Now there’s a different logic, of polarisation.” That dynamic was at work when Mr Sánchez, with the help of Catalan and Basque nationalists as well as Podemos, <strong>toppled</strong> a pp government with a censure motion over corruption in 2018. It was <strong>intensified</strong> by the rise of another new party, Vox, a hard-right <strong>splinter</strong> from the pp, initially in response to the threat of Catalan separatism.</p><p>Polarisation reached a new low in a nasty campaign for the recent snap election on May 4th in Madrid, which saw death threats, mailed with bullets, against six politicians, starting with Mr Iglesias. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the pp regional president, campaigned against Mr Sánchez, rather than her local rivals, under the banner of “freedom”—to keep taxes light and bars open despite the pandemic. This message and her <strong>spontaneous</strong> manner <strong>resonated</strong> far more with madrileños, weary of lockdowns, than Mr Iglesias’s overheated claim to be fighting “fascism”. Ms Díaz Ayuso doubled the pp’s vote and came close to an absolute majority of seats. The Socialists suffered a heavy defeat and were overtaken by Más Madrid, a regional party of <strong>dissidents</strong> from Podemos driven out by Mr Iglesias. Vox failed to gain much. Ciudadanos lost all its seats in the regional assembly, a failure that could prove terminal.</p><p>In some ways this result points to the <strong>resilience</strong> of the old two-party system, wounded though it remains. It suffers from “two very disruptive parties at the extremes” in Vox and Podemos, Mr González warns. Mr Iglesias’s departure, like Mr Rivera’s last year, underlined their failure to forge a “new politics”. A decade on, the politicians look just as disconnected from the voters. But citizens’ rage has given way to disillusion, aggravated by the pandemic’s destruction of lives and livelihoods. Five years of vigorous economic growth from 2014 to 2019 failed to restore Spaniards’ trust in their politicians and their institutions, among the lowest of any country in the European Union. The indignados broke more than they managed to build. </p><p><a id="france-worries-about-how-to-handle-released-terrorists"></a></p><h1 id="France-worries-about-how-to-handle-released-terrorists"><a href="#France-worries-about-how-to-handle-released-terrorists" class="headerlink" title="France worries about how to handle released terrorists"></a>France worries about how to handle released terrorists</h1><p>Many more are due to leave prison soon<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>“Being locked up is a piece of piss if the guy was ready to die,” said Youssef, who had been jailed for jihadism. “Ten years in prison? It’s fi sabilillah (in the cause of Allah). I’m going to learn the Koran, and leave even stronger.” Youssef (not his real name) was speaking to Hugo Micheron, a researcher conducting a study on <strong>jihadism</strong> in France. By the time the book was published last year, Youssef had served his term and been set free.</p><p>France is grappling with an unfamiliar challenge: how to handle those let out after serving time for terrorist-related offences. Of the 500 or so such detainees now behind bars, 58 are due for release this year, and a total of some 100 by 2023. Most were convicted for joining jihadist groups in Syria or Iraq, or helping others to do so. They were often sentenced to terms of only five to six years. Far <strong>stiffer</strong> sentences, including life, were handed down last December to accomplices in the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015.</p><p>Last year Jean-François Ricard, the chief anti-terrorist prosecutor, told the National Assembly that he had “a real fear” about what would happen to the “dozens of people who will leave prison, who are very dangerous”. Current law enables such prisoners, after a risk assessment, to be put under <strong>surveillance</strong> and their movements limited for up to a year after their release. A new anti-terrorism bill, which entrenches and extends measures introduced in 2017 to end a state of emergency, would increase this to two years. It would enable courts to compel freed offenders to check in with <strong>probation</strong> officers and other authorities, and to enrol in training schemes, work or psychological support, for up to five years.</p><p>France’s Constitutional Council last year rejected a previous version of some of these measures as a breach of fundamental freedoms, and told legislators to revise the bill. A reworked version is now going through parliament. Critics nonetheless worry about the mixed evidence of <strong>recidivism</strong> among released jihadists. A Belgian study, cited by Marc Hecker in a report for the French Institute of International Relations, suggested that just 2% of the 557 individuals convicted of jihadist terrorism between 1990 and 2019 re-offended.</p><p>In France, however, out of a sample of 137 individuals sentenced for cases related to jihadism between 2004 and 2017, at least 22 re-offended, left for jihad, attempted to kill a prison <strong>warden</strong> or breached the law against justifying terrorism. One of those released, Chérif Kouachi, took advantage of his freedom to help shoot and kill 12 people in 2015 at Charlie Hebdo, a magazine that had published cartoons satirising the Prophet Muhammad.</p><p>France is giving itself extra means, as well as legal powers, to fight terrorism. Since 2017 it has recruited an extra 1,900 intelligence officers and increased their budget. It has a new post of national counter-terrorism and intelligence co-ordinator. Fully 36 attacks have been foiled.</p><p>Yet the security services worry that there is nonetheless a pool of potential recruits to jihad on French soil who are increasingly difficult to detect. Each of the past eight terrorist attacks in France has been carried out by an individual who was previously unknown to the services. These include the fatal stabbing of a female police official in Rambouillet, west of Paris, last month, and the decapitation of Samuel Paty, a schoolteacher, in October.</p><p>Terrorism, according to a poll, is now a greater worry for the French than unemployment. Marine Le Pen, the nationalist leader who polls suggest will in 2022 again reach the second-round run-off of the presidential election, misses no chance to stir up panic. President Emmanuel Macron’s term in office, she recently declared, has been marked by “terrorist chaos”, and if he were re-elected this would provoke an “explosion”. Less than a year before the vote,Mr Macron cannot afford to appear timid towards terrorism.</p><p><a id="breathing-life-into-britain%E2%80%99s-life-sciences-industry"></a></p><h1 id="Breathing-life-into-Britain’s-life-sciences-industry"><a href="#Breathing-life-into-Britain’s-life-sciences-industry" class="headerlink" title="Breathing life into Britain’s life-sciences industry"></a>Breathing life into Britain’s life-sciences industry</h1><p>The government has high hopes for a sleeping giant<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>A few years ago, Seth Harrison, an American venture capitalist, was looking to open an office in Europe. The choice came down to Britain or Switzerland. “I got quite acquainted with the whole uk biotech scene,” he recalls. “The fantastic research <strong>ferment</strong> that occurs in the Golden Triangle. You know, the London, Cambridge, Oxford area…And I just said, ‘Wow, this reminds me of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 25 years ago.’”</p><p>The response to the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted that research capability—and many believe the world to be on the <strong>cusp</strong> of a “biological century” driven by biotech innovation. On April 29th Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for health and social care, gave a speech about the government’s desire to turn Britain into a “life-sciences superpower”. By some measures, it already is. Only American scientists are more highly cited.</p><p>But Britain struggles to produce superstar firms, or even the middling ones that build clusters. “Why is there not a Regeneron-type company or a Gilead-type company? That’s a fair question given the quality of the science,” says Matthias Evers of McKinsey, a consultancy. Last year British firms raised £1.4bn ($2bn) of venture capital: more than anywhere else in Europe; far less than the American hubs, Massachusetts (£4.7bn) and San Francisco (£4.5bn).</p><p>Firms that turn to public markets tend to cross the Atlantic, lured by the promise of <strong>heftier</strong> valuations. Recent ones include Immunocore (which develops drugs for cancer, and infectious and autoimmune diseases) and Vaccitech (a spin-off from Oxford’s Jenner Institute, of covid-19 vaccine fame). “We’re seeing uk biotech flourish,” says Alistair Campbell of Liberum, an investment bank. “It’s just not necessarily being listed on the uk stockmarket.”</p><p>The numbers suggest the pipeline is being <strong>replenished</strong>. The uk BioIndustry Association finds that in total biotech firms last year raised £2.8bn, up from an average of £1.6bn over the past three years. This reflects both a global increase and optimism about local strengths in cell-and-gene therapies and genetics. The country provides investors with “some pretty unfished waters”, notes Samantha Roberts of Legal &amp; General, a financial-services provider.</p><p>These waters have <strong>enticed</strong> Dr Harrison’s firm, Apple Tree Partners. It took longer than expected to hire staff, he says, partly because “one thing the uk does need is more people on the industry side.” They are now in place, and the firm hopes to unveil a few investments this year. “The ambition, pace and scale have picked up,” says Andy Richards, a veteran British investor.</p><p>Successive governments have tried to make this happen using tax inducements and investment—with only some success before the pandemic. Now investors expect spending in new areas. “You’ve got this…concern about <strong>sovereignty</strong> of supply,” says Dr Roberts. “You start to think, ‘Hang on, there’s going to be a big manufacturing base we will have to build here.’”</p><p>The government also hopes to improve less <strong>tangible</strong> bits of the country’s infrastructure. Britain currently carries out few late-stage trials. A government paper promises to build on the recovery trial, which uncovered two treatments for covid-19, by <strong>streamlining</strong> research and embedding it in the health service (further papers will explain exactly how). Mr Hancock wants to replicate fast regulation seen during approval of covid-19 vaccines, and to make the health service a more enthusiastic buyer of new treatments.</p><p>There are plenty of barriers to overcome, from the fact that lots of trials have been on hold over the past year to what one investor calls the “inertia in the soul” of the British scientist when it comes to exploiting discoveries financially. Yet insiders are optimistic. As Sir John Bell, who advises the government on life sciences and is chairman of Immunocore, puts it: “I’m pretty confident that we can build a substantial new industry from the ground up.” The coming years will show whether private money and government efforts can do just that. </p><p><a id="the-pandemic-has-caused-a-shortage-of-cadavers"></a></p><h1 id="The-pandemic-has-caused-a-shortage-of-cadavers"><a href="#The-pandemic-has-caused-a-shortage-of-cadavers" class="headerlink" title="The pandemic has caused a shortage of cadavers"></a>The pandemic has caused a shortage of cadavers</h1><p>Surgical training is suffering as a result<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Press a knife into human flesh and, as the blade slides in, the sensation subtly changes. Human skin, says Claire Smith, professor of <strong>anatomy</strong> at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, “feels like chicken skin”; it is “slightly rougher” and “not always slippery”. Slice into a human artery, meanwhile, and you will feel “a little bit of springback”; while veins just feel “flat” and nerves, says Dr Smith, “feel like a noodle”.</p><p>This complex stew of sensations that travels from blade to brain is known in the trade as “<strong>haptic</strong> feedback” and, in surgery, it matters. It has also, this year, been hard for trainee medics to come by. Because the covid-19 pandemic has caused—and the irony of this hardly needs to be <strong>laboured</strong>—a shortage in cadavers.</p><p>Britain has experience of such shortages, and of attempts to fix them. An enterprising early attempt to increase supply in Edinburgh by Burke and Hare ended with the execution of Burke, the introduction of the 1832 Anatomy Act and a general sense that <strong>dissection</strong> was a bit <strong>ghoulish</strong>. (Burke died as he lived: his body was publicly dissected and his skeleton still stands in Edinburgh’s anatomical museum.)</p><p>Supplying the market remains tricky. <strong>Squeamishness</strong> is undoubtedly one problem: people rarely like to think of their own death, still less of what happens to their own all too solid flesh after it. Anatomy departments, unlike organ donation programmes, do not advertise for custom. Strict quality-control standards also act as a brake on the numbers accepted. All men may be born equal but they do not, in the eyes of anatomists, die so. Bodies are rejected for a large number of reasons, including being too thin (not enough to dissect); too fat (anatomy tables have weight limits); too tall (cadavers come inconveniently off the ends of those tables) and for having a large unhealed wound (the <strong>embalming</strong> fluid pours out).</p><p>And the regulations are getting ever tighter. Before 2004, so-called “second-person consent” was allowed, meaning that bodies could be donated on the word of the next of kin—and that families who wished to donate an <strong>irksome</strong> aunt, thus saving on funeral costs, could do so. Now, only first-person consent, in the form of a form, signed by the individual, will suffice.</p><p>To fill the gap in its market, Britain imports parts from America, where rules are looser—second-person consent is permitted, as is the use of unclaimed corpses from prisons and elsewhere—but is attempting to become more self-sufficient. In 2015 a National <strong>Repository</strong> Centre was established in Nottingham to source and store cadavers. It <strong>couriers</strong> parts around the country, using undertakers. International transport is done by specialists—not, says Dr Smith, “dpd or anything”.</p><p>Though supply is constrained, demand for corpses has been growing as the numbers training to be doctors have increased. In 2005, medical schools bought 600 cadavers; in 2017, 1,300. Given both rising demand and supply constraints, it is perhaps surprising that arms and legs do not cost an arm and a leg. Nor do heads: the going rate for one in America is around $500; a foot is $350 (prices are similar in Britain).</p><p>Covid-19 has made things trickier still. Body donation in Britain paused, since no one was certain whether bodies would be infectious. Besides, medical schools had other priorities. Dr Smith gained a temporary <strong>mortuary</strong> in a car park and around 400 <strong>deceased</strong> victims of the pandemic. She and her lecturers tended them between teaching sessions.</p><p>Despite deaths of more than 100,000 in excess of what the country would normally have experienced since the pandemic began, the nation’s anatomy departments have therefore struggled to fill their fridges. Dr Smith’s department usually requires around 70 donors a year: so far it is around 30 short. The London Anatomy Office, which provides cadavers for seven medical schools in and near the capital, normally receives and processes 150 or so bodies every three months. Between March and June last year it took none.</p><p>During the pandemic this lack of cadavers didn’t matter, as many training courses were being paused and operations cancelled anyway. Now that the pandemic is easing, surgical training is starting to pick up again, as is donation, but anatomy departments are still struggling to meet demand. Shortages are contributing to what the British Medical Journal has called a “crisis” in surgical training.</p><p>There are ways around the shortage of cadavers: surgeons can and do train in other ways, such as 3d computer simulations. But though these are good they are not, says Neil Mortensen of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, “yet good enough for advanced surgical training.”</p><p>Other nations use different solutions. In some countries, surgeons still train on live animals, a practice that has many advantages—including realistic haptic feedback: if you cut a dog, it will bleed. Unfortunately for medics, so too do the hearts of animal-loving Britons at the thought of such things, and the practice is not done here. Although even if it were, it might not help. Pet ownership has increased so rapidly in the pandemic that dogs, like cadavers, are now in short supply.</p><p><a id="new-technology-has-enabled-cyber-crime-on-an-industrial-scale"></a></p><h1 id="New-technology-has-enabled-cyber-crime-on-an-industrial-scale"><a href="#New-technology-has-enabled-cyber-crime-on-an-industrial-scale" class="headerlink" title="New technology has enabled cyber-crime on an industrial scale"></a>New technology has enabled cyber-crime on an industrial scale</h1><p>A decentralised dark economy makes cyber-<strong>crooks</strong> more effective and harder to catch<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Nobody likes a call from the taxman. Donald Rumsfeld, who as America’s defence secretary oversaw a budget bigger than the economy of a typical country, nonetheless finds the rules so confusing that he writes to the Internal Revenue Service each year complaining that he has “no idea” whether he has filed his taxes correctly. So it is hardly surprising that, when the phone rings and an official-sounding voice says you have underpaid your taxes and will be connected to an adviser to pay the balance, ordinary folk tremble.</p><p>It is, however, <strong>invariably</strong> a scam. Few tax authorities call individuals about their taxes. If you are lucky, they will send you a letter a year later, to the wrong address. They will certainly not menace you, as <strong>bogus</strong> calls often do, with the threat of arrest if you do not stump up the cash right now.</p><p>Such scams have become vastly more common. Phone calls from tricksters claiming to be taxmen almost doubled in number last year, according to uk Finance, a trade association of banks. Other countries show increases at least as dramatic.</p><p>Even as rates of most crimes remain low in rich countries, the spectacular growth of cyber-crime—crime committed mostly or entirely by digital means—stands out. According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, the best indicator of long-term trends in Britain, in 2019 there were 3.8m incidents of fraud, mostly online, representing a third of all crimes committed. That figure has increased every year since 2017 when the government started collecting data. Around 7% of all adults were victims. Three-quarters lost money, and 15% lost more than £1,000 ($1,390). In America the number of reported cases of internet fraud increased by 69% last year. Reported losses there (excluding bank or credit-card fraud) reached $4.2bn, three times higher than in 2017.</p><p>Other kinds of internet-enabled crime are growing too. Computer-enabled spam phone calls and text messages, typically trying to defraud people, extract billions of dollars a year. Illegal gambling websites, many of which steal from their customers, have multiplied. And new technology makes many old-fashioned crimes easier to <strong>perpetrate</strong>. Drug-dealers use Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, to take payments and move money around. They rely on specialised criminal encrypted-communications software to organise their affairs. “There is no serious organised crime that does not have a digital component,” says Nigel Leary of Britain’s National Crime Agency (nca).</p><p>Most significant over the past year is the growth in “<strong>ransomware</strong>”—hacking attacks where victims’ files are locked up until money is paid. Such attacks were once crude. Ransomware arrived in spam emails and targeted ordinary people’s computers. The sums demanded were often small, to encourage people to pay up.</p><p>These days hackers focus on large organisations and demand big <strong>ransoms</strong> (see chart). <strong>Malicious</strong> software is injected into specific computer systems. It steals data before locking them. A ransom is then demanded to unlock the files or, increasingly, to prevent them from being leaked (backups of important data are common now). It is almost always in Bitcoin. Chainalysis, a cyber-security firm, says the amount paid in Bitcoin ransoms increased by 311% last year compared with 2019, to around $350m. Victims are usually businesses but more and more include governments and their departments, including the police. On April 27th Washington dc’s coppers revealed that they had been hit by hackers, who say they will expose police <strong>informants</strong> to gangs if the authorities do not pay up.</p><p>Ransomware is “the single biggest threat” in the organised-crime world, says Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Sussex who advises Europol, the eu’s police agency. On April 29th Alejandro Mayorkas, America’s secretary of homeland security, described it as “a threat to national security”. The damage is enormous. Maersk, a global shipping company, wrote down $300m in losses related to a ransomware attack in 2017. Travelex, a British currency trader, collapsed last year, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. An attack that took its systems down at the end of 2019 was partly to blame. Despite <strong>coughing up</strong> 285 Bitcoin—then worth around $2.3m—the firm lost about £25m that quarter. It attributed most of that to the attack.</p><p>Ransoms can be eye-watering: an attack in March on the Broward County school system, which includes Fort Lauderdale in Florida, came with a demand for $40m in Bitcoin. In messages leaked by the hackers, one of the district’s negotiators was <strong>incredulous</strong>: “You cannot possibly think we have anything close to this.”</p><p>Most government bodies do not. But the consequences of not paying can be just as costly. In Baltimore County, in Maryland, schools had to stop online teaching last year for several days after their systems were locked by a ransomware attack. In 2019 an attack on the neighbouring City of Baltimore cost its taxpayers $18m. During the pandemic, hospitals have been hit, too. France reported 27 attacks on hospitals last year, as part of a 255% increase in ransomware attacks generally. Medical treatments have been delayed in Germany and America because of attacks.</p><p>Bitcoin <strong>buccaneers</strong><br>The criminals who do it are a mixed bunch. Many seem to be based in Russia, other parts of eastern Europe, or China. In Russia and Belarus, cyber-criminals thrive because the state tolerates them, as long as they scam only foreigners. Some reportedly have links to the security services.</p><p>But cyber-criminals do not seem to operate in tightly organised crime groups, like drug <strong>cartels</strong> or mafias. Their strength comes from their decentralisation. Individual elements of each crime are provided as a service to organisers. One lot may write and sell the software. Others may get it into targets’ computers. Others may collect and launder the ransom. And a few <strong>kingpins</strong> may finance the entire operation. And yet they may never know each other’s names or locations.</p><p>Crimes such as bank robbery used to be <strong>artisanal</strong>, says the nca’s Mr Leary. Big jobs like the Brink’s-Mat robbery of 1983, when gold, diamonds and cash worth £26m (£100m in today’s money) were stolen from a warehouse at Heathrow airport in London, required a large specialist staff who all knew and trusted one another. These days large-scale crime is being industrialised by technology. “The barriers to entry are really very low,” says Mr Leary.</p><p>That is largely because an entire internet infrastructure has developed to facilitate attacks. Cryptocurrency is key. Ransomware criminals like to use Bitcoin, says Kemba Walden, a lawyer with Microsoft’s digital-crimes unit because it is very liquid and relatively anonymous. The end recipient is anonymous unless his real-world identity can be connected to his virtual address. Criminals can trade Bitcoin between themselves. Cashing out their earnings into real money is risky; in most rich countries Bitcoin exchanges apply strict “know your customer” requirements. But it is not impossible. Some exchanges in less-regulated countries apply looser <strong>criteria</strong>. And coins can be “tumbled”—swapped between cryptocurrencies by money-launderers—to conceal their origins, and then sold on well-regulated exchanges. In Russia and China “it’s just incredibly difficult” to trace stolen money, says Ms Walden.</p><p>Other technological innovations are vital, too. simboxes, which allow people to “<strong>spoof</strong>” (conceal the origin of) phone calls, are sold for legitimate purposes, to marketing firms, for example. But they also allow criminals to spam people or communicate without revealing their location. tor, softwarewhich anonymises internet connections by bouncing data around the world, lets the “dark web” thrive, hosting the forums on which criminals anonymously trade their wares. “Bulletproof hosting”—server farms with a high level of security and privacy—operate like virtual safe houses, where compromising data can be moved off at a moment’s notice, <strong>invariably</strong> before the police are able to get to it.</p><p>What is the future of such crime? As ransomware has grown, so has the industry promising to protect firms from it. The crime is “becoming more high-profile”, says Michael Levi of Cardiff University, because of attacks such as the one on Maersk. Organisations are trying to <strong>buttress</strong> their defences. But many do not want to report hacking attempts or fraud. Data breaches are not only damaging in themselves; they are embarrassing, too. Individuals rarely think to report cyber-crimes to the police. The costs may be borne indirectly. Banks and insurers will often compensate people for losses. Security is improving but the crimes are increasingly profitable.</p><p>The police <strong>fret</strong> that more traditional criminals are moving into cyber-crime, and vice versa. “Now the dark web is used for the commodity trade [fencing of stolen goods], the drugs trade and firearms,” says Mr Leary. In <strong>raids</strong> in Belgium in March police seized 28 tonnes of cocaine, as well as cash, guns, police uniforms and a <strong>torture</strong> chamber in a shipping container. The criminals had reportedly been using Sky ecc, an encrypted phone network sold by a Canadian firm. The phones were seemingly designed to hide criminal activity, with end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages and no gps data. Subscriptions were paid in Bitcoin. That gave them a great deal of anonymity—at least until European police forces managed to inject their own malware into the phones to spy on them.</p><p>Governments are starting to take cyber-crime more seriously. America’s Justice Department has appointed a team to tackle ransomware. The “five eyes” allies—America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—are sharing intelligence on it. But there is a long way to go. In Britain only one in 200 police officers focuses on fraud, despite its outsized footprint, according to figures revealed through the Freedom of Information Act by the Times newspaper.</p><p>And the opportunities are growing. In the past six months the value of the world’s Bitcoin has soared to over $1trn. That surge of liquidity makes it even easier to hide crime. And as Mr Woodward puts it: “Why would you walk into a bank with a <strong>sawn-off</strong> shotgun to steal £30,000 when, if you’ve got some money to invest, you can go on the dark web and start a ransomware campaign and make millions?” </p><p><a id="can-human-creativity-prevent-mass-unemployment"></a></p><h1 id="Can-human-creativity-prevent-mass-unemployment"><a href="#Can-human-creativity-prevent-mass-unemployment" class="headerlink" title="Can human creativity prevent mass unemployment?"></a>Can human creativity prevent mass unemployment?</h1><p>The market for artisan goods is likely to grow. But organised craft could lose its charm<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In “THE REPAIR SHOP”, a British television series, carpenters, textile workers and mechanics mend family <strong>heirlooms</strong> that viewers have brought to their workshop. The fascination comes from watching them apply their craft to restore these <strong>keepsakes</strong> and the emotional appeal from the tears that follow when the owner is presented with the beautifully rendered result.</p><p>Perhaps the idea of craftsmanship is not simply nostalgic. In a new paper in the Academy of Management Annals, five academics examine the idea of crafts as a way of remaking the organisation of work. They define craft as “a humanist approach to work that prioritises human engagement over machine control”. Crafts require distinct skills, an all-round approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an attitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The concept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment.</p><p>Essentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the <strong>preponderant</strong> <strong>ethos</strong> of management studies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. Frederick Winslow Taylor, a pioneer of management studies, operated with a stopwatch and perceived human workers as inefficient, and potentially disobedient, machines. Craft skills were portrayed as being <strong>primitive</strong> and traditionalist.</p><p>The contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the <strong>fore</strong> in the 19th century when British manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed the “American system” using standardised parts. Initially these techniques were applied to arms manufacture but the worldwide success of the Singer sewing machine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own reaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th century, and then again in the “small is beautiful” movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as people become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry.</p><p>There are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the existence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to be of extra quality. This niche stretches all the way down from designer fashion through craft beers to bakeries offering “artisan” loaves.To the extent that automation takes over more sectors, this niche seems likely to become more <strong>lucrative</strong>; there is “<strong>snob</strong> value” in owning a good that is not mass produced. The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their purchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to craftspeople to be mended, or recycled.</p><p>For workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative choices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the overall labour market. Let the machines automate <strong>dull</strong> and repetitive tasks and let workers focus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite the “<strong>agile</strong>” <strong>manifesto</strong> in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change. The pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise “individuals and interactions over processes and tools”. By bringing together experts from different teams, agile working is designed to improve creativity.</p><p>But the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today. Demand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might get automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and services often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the advantage.</p><p>History also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft guilds were monopolies which resisted new <strong>entrants</strong>. They were also highly <strong>hierarchical</strong> with young men required to spend long periods as apprentices and journeymen before they could set up on their own; by that time the innovative spirit may have been knocked out of them. Craft workers can thrive in the modern era, but only if they don’t get too organised.</p><p><a id="older-consumers-have-learned-new-tricks-in-the-pandemic"></a></p><h1 id="Older-consumers-have-learned-new-tricks-in-the-pandemic"><a href="#Older-consumers-have-learned-new-tricks-in-the-pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Older consumers have learned new tricks in the pandemic"></a>Older consumers have learned new tricks in the pandemic</h1><p>Companies had better keep up<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Baby boomers, aged 57-75, are as the name implies, plentiful. Healthier and more adventurous than similarly aged <strong>cohorts</strong> in the past, since 2018 over-65s have outnumbered the under-fives. They are also wealthier. America’s boomer-led households spend $64,000 a year, almost twice as much as those <strong>headed by</strong> youngsters born from 1997 onwards. Together with the earlier “silent” generation, they account for two-fifths of American consumer spending. Yet brands and retailers have long given older shoppers short <strong>shrift</strong>, focusing most of their attention on the wrinkle-free. As with many things, the pandemic is demanding a rethink.</p><p>For one thing, fear of covid-19, more deadly for the elderly, has <strong>ushered</strong> oldies online. Last year British over-65s made up 30% of consumer-goods purchases online, up from 20% in 2019. In August Britain’s Office for National Statistics reported that 65% of them had shopped online in the preceding 12 months, compared with 54% the year before. America’s over-65s spent 53% more on internet shopping than the year before, according to NielsenIQ, a research firm (see chart).</p><p>Hinge, an e-commerce consultancy, says that sales of products <strong>disproportionately</strong> bought by older people, from meal replacements to adult nappies, have jumped by 50% or more, outpacing overall sales. Businesses catering to older consumers are adapting. The <strong>staple</strong> of GoGoGrandparent used to be helping greying North American <strong>technophobes</strong> book ride-sharing services by phone. With social distancing this business <strong>dwindled</strong>, says Justin Boogaard, its co-founder. In April 2020 the firm diversified into delivering food to old folks with <strong>dietary</strong> restrictions; these are up by 300% since then, it says.</p><p>It isn’t just products aimed specifically at the old that the elderly are <strong>snapping up on</strong> the internet. Their online spending on <strong>booze</strong> nearly <strong>quadrupled</strong> in America, estimates NielsenIQ. SilverSingles, a dating website, reports healthy growth in the number of new monthly users. Virtual first dates featuring wine tasting, food deliveries and film streaming are all the rage, affording brands the chance to offer their wares to oldies who have signed up.</p><p>Brands are also attempting to appeal to the elderly through such things as “healthy ageing” products, which the pandemic has turned into a <strong>craze</strong>. Nestlé, a Swiss consumer-goods giant, has launched a milk drink in China, which supposedly aids <strong>mobility</strong>. Reckitt Benckiser, a British rival, is marketing one that targets immunity. Danone, a French yogurt-maker, is investing in developing similar products. Companies are also thinking about spending more on <strong>wrinkle-friendly</strong> adverts; just 3% of America’s ad spending is aimed at people over 50, reckons Joseph Coughlin, who runs the AgeLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Some innovations welcome in a pandemic may be less so once it passes, especially for retailers. Maintaining priority slots for online deliveries to the elderly, and not charging them a delivery fee on what tend to be small orders ferried at a loss, is going to be costly, warns one supermarket boss. Yet companies will face pressure to keep them to retain custom, especially with ever more physical shops shut for good.</p><p>They may also need to make online shopping easier than it already is. That could mean fewer forms that the elderly (and everyone else) find <strong>fiddly</strong>, and more options as to how and when to pay, to reassure older shoppers who worry about sharing credit-card details. Having taught oldies some new tricks during the pandemic, firms must now learn a few themselves. </p><p><a id="will-going-digital-transform-the-yuan%E2%80%99s-status-at-home-and-abroad"></a></p><h1 id="Will-going-digital-transform-the-yuan’s-status-at-home-and-abroad"><a href="#Will-going-digital-transform-the-yuan’s-status-at-home-and-abroad" class="headerlink" title="Will going digital transform the yuan’s status at home and abroad?"></a>Will going digital transform the yuan’s status at home and abroad?</h1><p>Don’t count on it: the new yuan will be a lot like the old yuan<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>With a few taps on her phone, Lu Qingqing, a 24-year-old office worker, leapt into the monetary future. She was one of 50,000 people in Shenzhen selected late last year for a trial of China’s digital currency, called ecny. She downloaded an app, received 200 yuan ($30) from the government and went shopping for books. The app’s display showed a traditional <strong>banknote</strong>. “It felt like real money,” she says.</p><p>Legally, it is as real as hard cash. All the money in an ecny app, offered by one of six commercial banks, is backed by an equivalent deposit at the People’s Bank of China. Just as the central bank stands behind any paper yuan, so does it guarantee ecny. If, say, the commercial bank that made Ms Lu’s digital wallet went bust, her ecny—linked to her personal-identity number—would be transferred to a new wallet.</p><p>Central banks worldwide are considering issuing digital versions of notes and coins. Although China will not be the first (that honour goes to the Bahamas), it is the most important launching ground. It is the world’s leader in mobile payments (see chart 1). More than half a million people have already received ecny in trials since last year. China’s central bank is studying how to spread it abroad. Niall Ferguson, a historian, has called on America to wake up to the <strong>peril</strong> of letting China “mint the money of the future”.</p><p>China’s digital currency was first conceived as a way to curb the big mobile-money providers. Now three bold claims are being made about it: that it will dramatically enhance China’s surveillance capabilities; that it will allow the state to wield far more control over money; and that it will challenge the dollar for prominence.</p><p>Within China, however, many economists are far less <strong>bullish</strong>. The design of the ecny, and the nature of China’s economic system, mean that each of these claims is unlikely to be realised soon. “The digital yuan is not magic, so we don’t expect magic from it,” says Gary Liu of the China Financial Reform Institute in Shanghai.</p><p>Start with the first claim, that digitisation offers unmatched surveillance abilities, letting the state track all spending. It is not entirely wrong. But it is a limited gain compared with its existing powers.</p><p>Most mobile payments today involve a bank card, <strong>tethered</strong> to users’ accounts on Alipay or WeChat. These must pass through NetsUnion, a central clearing platform. Similarly, foreign-exchange transactions take place on the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. In both cases regulators can see how people spend in real time. For mobile payments that do not touch banks, officials can demand a record and, says an industry insider, may soon require real-time reporting, too.</p><p>The <strong>upshot</strong> is that, even without ecny, regulators have no real blind spots left, apart from old-fashioned cash. And so long as millions of older citizens do not much like paying for things with smartphones, the government will not phase out cash.</p><p>The second bold claim about ecny is that it will reshape monetary policy in China. According to this view, the central bank will be able to program money to be used for specific purposes and at predefined times. This, however, both understates what the central bank can already do and overstates what the ecny will let it do.</p><p>China already manages both the money supply and interest rates with different sectors in mind. Since 2015, for instance, it has created hundreds of billions of yuan for the construction of affordable housing. More recently it has instructed banks to lower interest rates for small firms.</p><p>The ecny, one might assume, will make targeting more precise. But its design will <strong>circumscribe</strong> its role. The central bank will replace only a small portion of base money, known as m0, with ecny, leaving the rest of the money supply undisturbed (see chart 2). It will distribute ecny through commercial banks, which in turn will make it available to the public. It will not pay interest on ecny. And it will probably place low ceilings on how much people can hold.</p><p>Granted, the central bank may in time expand the ecny’s role. But the limitations exist for a reason. The government is wary of undermining the financial system. It does not want savers to switch out of bank deposits en masse into ecny, which would make it harder for banks to fund themselves. Moreover, few serious economists in Beijing like the idea of a 100% ecny money supply, in which the government could directly control how banks lend. “We don’t want to go back to central planning. That would be a mistake,” says Yu Yongding, a former adviser to the central bank.</p><p>The final bold claim is that ecny will <strong>catapult</strong> the yuan to global status. But that misunderstands why it accounts for just 2% of international payments today, about the same as the Canadian dollar. When deciding which currencies to use, companies and investors consider how easily they can make conversions to other currencies; how freely they can invest them; and whether they trust the issuing countries’ legal systems. China’s insistence on maintaining far tighter capital controls than any other major economy, as well as deep-seated doubts about its political system, blunt the yuan’s appeal. The limiting factors are policy and politics, not technology.</p><p>Even the technological case for ecny is far from <strong>clear-cut</strong>. When companies transfer money in and out of China, they already use currency in a digital format: electronic messages on the swift payments network instruct banks to credit accounts in one country and <strong>debit</strong> them in another. What slows things down is complying with China’s capital controls and with international regulations such as those aimed at stopping money-laundering.</p><p>The ecny will not eliminate such checks, and the Belgium-headquartered swift system, which connects more than 11,000 financial institutions, is likely to remain the most efficient conduit for sharing payment information across borders. “Even in the long term, swift will remain indispensable,” says Liu Dongmin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</p><p>The three more radical claims about it may not be realised, but will the ecny fulfil the original aim, of giving the central bank a <strong>foothold</strong> in the digital-payments universe? Probably, but not a giant one. After the ecny trial in Shenzhen, Ms Lu said that she would use it for some payments, but that Alipay and WeChat were far more convenient because of how they tie into commercial and social-messaging networks. Mr Liu of the China Financial Reform Institute expects others to <strong>concur</strong>. He predicts that in three years the ecny will account for less than 5% of mobile payments.</p><p>Western governments and central bankers <strong>mulling</strong> digital currencies of their own may wonder if the outcome of the ecny experiment will contain any lessons for them. But China is unusual in so many ways—from its sheltered financial system and intricate capital controls to the size of its mobile payments—that its experience could well prove to be unique. And other countries are sure to implement different designs for their digital currencies. Still, China’s caution with the ecny, if nothing else, hints at how disruptive the technology, if unconstrained, could be. </p><p><a id="older-women-are-getting-richer-how-will-wealth-managers-adapt"></a></p><h1 id="Older-women-are-getting-richer-How-will-wealth-managers-adapt"><a href="#Older-women-are-getting-richer-How-will-wealth-managers-adapt" class="headerlink" title="Older women are getting richer.

How will wealth managers adapt?</h1><p>The gains from experimentation could extend beyond older women<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Ella prichard found herself rebuilding the family fortune after Lev, her husband of 46 years, died during the global financial crisis. She went from having little to do with the finances to firing the family’s longtime advisers at JPMorgan Chase, interviewing banks and eventually hiring a team at Brown Brothers Harriman. “That move from smiling spouse to client was not easy,” the 80-year-old says.</p><p>Older women like Ms Prichard control a growing share of the world’s wealth. In 1989 the median American household headed by a woman over 65 was poorer than average. By 2019 it was 20% richer. That partly reflects the fact that older women today are more likely to have had careers of their own than their mothers and grandmothers. But inherited wealth also plays a role—and indeed will become more important in the years to come.</p><p>Some $68trn in wealth is estimated to change hands in America alone by 2042, in large part as baby boomers die, according to Cerulli, a research firm. A lot of it will flow first to widows, who in <strong>heterosexual</strong> couples tend to be younger and live longer than their husbands. Researchers estimate that about half of women over 65 outlive their husbands by 15 years. In a report last year McKinsey, a consultancy, reckoned that much of boomers’ wealth would be managed by women by 2030. These huge transfers are forcing wealth managers, long used to serving men, to rethink their approach to clients.</p><p>There is little evidence that older women invest drastically differently than men, or have radically different views towards risk or asset allocation. The stereotype may be of a kindly, cautious granny. But American tax data suggest that wealthy older women are as likely to hold stocks, which are riskier than bonds, as the average rich person. Women seem to place more emphasis on sustainable investing, but seem less bothered by charity. A global survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister organisation, found that 22% of boomer women think charitable giving is not important to how they manage their wealth, compared with 16% of men.</p><p>What is clear is that boomer women want a different experience at the bank. Many women say they <strong>resented</strong> the way advisers treated them when their husbands were still alive, making no eye contact at meetings or printing just the one copy of financial reports. Once they are calling the shots, they want personal service. In a recent McKinsey poll of rich investors, over half the women surveyed said it was “extremely important” to find an adviser who matches their personality, compared with around 40% of men. Advisers say these women want help meeting goals, be that paying grandchildren’s college fees or buying another home in Cap Ferrat, not just beating the market.</p><p>Another requirement seems to be financial education: three-quarters of wealthy widows and divorcees say they don’t feel knowledgeable about investing, according to a survey by ubs. The problem may be confidence rather than competence, though. Women think it is really important not to <strong>shoot from the hip</strong>, says Sharon Oberlander of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.</p><p>Banks are sitting up. Wealth management, which generates steady fees and does not require as much capital as lending or trading securities, is an increasingly important part of their business. And <strong>dissatisfied</strong> clients, like Ms Prichard, vote with their feet: over a fifth of widows who had a financial adviser with their husbands go on to find a new one, reckons a survey by Spectrem Group, a research firm. Losing a client means losing a shot at managing her heirs’ wealth, too.</p><p>Banks are trying lots of things in response. One is simply to understand what clients want. ubs produces <strong>reams</strong> of research on female investors. Goldman Sachs tells its advisers to get to know the accountants and lawyers of the ultra-rich; JPMorgan’s training for advisers begins with a section on getting into investors’ hearts and minds.</p><p>Another approach is to offer more female-friendly service. On a superficial level, golf is out, and spa days are in. Most banks are hiring more women and training advisers to interact with families, not just men, and to manage personal conversations better.</p><p>No one knows yet what strategy will prove most successful, but the gains from experimentation seem likely to extend beyond older women. Financial decisions are no longer the <strong>preserve</strong> of men alone. Women control about a third of household wealth in America, and the share is likely to rise. Surveys suggest that millennial investors too want financial education and, when they seek advice, want it to be <strong>tailored</strong> to them. The firm that adapts the fastest could reap the rewards for generations to come.</p><p><a id="could-sending-criminals-to-prison-be-good-for-their-kids"></a></p><h1 id="Could-sending-criminals-to-prison-be-good-for-their-kids"><a href="#Could-sending-criminals-to-prison-be-good-for-their-kids" class="headerlink" title="Could sending criminals to prison be good for their kids?"></a>Could sending criminals to prison be good for their kids?</h1><p>A new study causes controversy<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>In a forthcoming paper in the American Economic Review, one of the <strong>discipline’s</strong> most <strong>prestigious</strong> journals, three economists conclude that “parental <strong>incarceration</strong> has beneficial effects on some important outcomes for children.” Unsurprisingly the study has provoked outrage from keyboard warriors. Some are uncomfortable with the very notion that prison could have anything other than wholly <strong>malign</strong> effects. Others worry that the research, however well <strong>intentioned</strong>, gives politicians ammunition to double down on <strong>punitive</strong> <strong>penal</strong> policy. In reality, though the study has some uncomfortable findings, it should help governments devise better policy.</p><p>The authors analyse 30 years’ worth of high-quality administrative data from the state of Ohio. They study children whose parents are defendants in a criminal case. Using a clever methodology, they in effect divide the children into two groups, which are identical except in one crucial respect: whether or not one of their parents was sent to prison. In some cases, parents who committed relatively minor crimes were on the wrong side of harsh judges, whereas others got off scot-free for the same offence.</p><p>The paper reports a number of outcomes, not all of which are improved by a parental stay in prison. The “estimates on academic performance and teen parenthood are imprecise,” the authors say. But a parent’s <strong>incarceration</strong> lowers the chance of their child going to prison from 12.4% to 7.5%. It also appears to cause the children to go on to live in better-off neighbourhoods, which could be a sign that household earnings rise. Perhaps having a parent go to prison scares a child straight; or perhaps removing a bad influence from a family allows those left behind to thrive.</p><p>Does this mean that America would benefit from even tougher penal policy? Hardly. The paper’s findings suggest that the overall costs of the prison system, including the money spent on housing <strong>inmates</strong>, are likely to outweigh the benefits. The true messages of the paper are subtler. Any effort to reduce America’s sky-high incarceration rate, though noble, would need to reckon with the costs that it might impose on some children. It is a sorry state of affairs that American kids could stand to gain when their parents are locked up. The challenge for economists and politicians is to find policies to help them that are not as socially destructive.</p>]]></content>

Now, judging by fresh election results, by the eruption of criticism even in the largely <strong>docile</strong> mainstream media, by sharp <strong>reprimands</strong> issued by top courts, by thumbs-down judgments by seasoned analysts and by a level of rage on social media unusual even for India’s hothouse online forums, the prime minister and his government are in trouble.</p><p>It is not simply that evidence has mounted of repeated failures to <strong>heed</strong> warnings of an impending second wave of covid-19, including from the government’s own health experts. Nor is it just that Mr Modi and his team have struggled to respond to a <strong>calamity</strong> greater than India has experienced in generations. Indians are accustomed to <strong>ineptitude</strong> and <strong>meagre</strong> support. Rather it is a sense of utter abandonment, especially among the politically noisy middle class, that is driving the anger.</p><p>The epidemic continues to worsen. On May 5th the country reported over 412,000 new infections, its highest number yet. Half of all cases of covid-19 recorded around the world are in India, up from one in 25 at the start of March. The number of covid deaths tripled in March, and then in April leapt by a factor of ten. With a quarter of all tests in the country returning a positive result, up five-fold in the past month, it is clear that India’s monster second wave has yet to reach its peak. Already nearly a quarter of a million Indians have died after being infected by the virus, and that is going by the government’s own numbers.</p><p>For any country to suffer such devastation is awful enough. But even as the official death toll has mounted, faith in its accuracy has sunk. <strong>Epidemiological</strong> and <strong>anecdotal</strong> evidence point to massive undercounting. Journalists across India have detailed scores of cases where official tallies are much lower than those gathered from hospitals, crematoriums and obituaries. In rural areas, where two-thirds of the population lives, both data and health care are even harder to come by. Partly as a result, a curve that has moved as sharply as the one describing infections is the one tracing the reputation of India’s government, <strong>albeit</strong> in the opposite direction.</p><p>Mr Modi has done himself no favours. During much of March and April he devoted far more energy to campaigning in one state election, in West Bengal, than to increasingly urgent cries of panic. In response to the revelation that his government had hugely miscalculated the availability of vaccines, he turned to showmanship, declaring a national “Tika Utsav” or Inoculation Festival. Since it was launched, the number of people getting vaccinations every day has fallen by half, owing to shortages. Belatedly addressing the public on April 20th, Mr Modi warned against lockdowns and called instead for testing, isolating the infected and tracing their contacts. Recognising that it was too late for such measures to have any effect, most Indian states and big cities locked down anyway.</p><p>The crisis has forced Mr Modi’s government into embarrassing policy reversals. Its vaccine campaign, <strong>touted</strong> in January as the world’s biggest and most generous, has been sharply adjusted. After banning vaccine exports to address the national shortfall, the government abruptly declared that individual states and private actors would have to bear half the burden. Despite proclaiming self-reliance as the <strong>hallmark</strong> of his new India, Mr Modi broke with a policy begun by the previous government of rejecting foreign aid, and welcomed planeloads of medical supplies donated by more than a dozen foreign governments. The <strong>severity</strong> of shortages, particularly of oxygen, and the wrenching and very public misery caused by this growing disaster made it impossible not to.</p><p>But the misfortunes of Mr Modi’s government have been compounded by haplessness. The public, overwhelmed with anguish at death on so vast a scale, has been <strong>flabbergasted</strong> by repeated revelations of incompetence. Initial shipments of aid, they discovered, had been held up by officials wanting to impose duties. These were eventually removed and local sales taxes abolished or reduced. (But on oxygen concentrators, a life-saving instrument, this was from a crushing 28% to a merely <strong>gouging</strong> 12%.) In the state of Gujarat it was revealed that factories making gas-storage tanks, which use oxygen in the manufacturing process, had halted production of the desperately needed containers because the government was allocating all oxygen to hospitals.</p><p>The state’s displays of pure <strong>callousness</strong> have also been shocking. Residents of Delhi, whose hospitals are completely full, have been treated to the spectacle of the solicitor-general arguing that its state government, which needed help with oxygen supplies, was being a “cry baby”. With the capital under strict <strong>curfew</strong>, Mr Modi’s government has also given special licence for work to continue on a $2.6bn project to overhaul the grand government buildings of the city centre, including a fancy new residence for the prime minister.</p><p>Meanwhile the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, tipped by some as a successor to Mr Modi, has not only declared that there is no oxygen shortage in his poor state of 225m people, but that individuals and even hospitals that spread “rumours” of shortages would be vigorously prosecuted. “This government has lost its mind,” shouts a man who has just lost his niece in a hospital in Meerut, a city in north-western Uttar Pradesh, in a scene captured by Newslaundry, an investigative news group. ”They talk of being a superpower, but what kind of superpower can’t even find oxygen for its people?”</p><p>Elections, of course, will prove the real test of what this change in fortunes may mean for Mr Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp). He does not face a national one until 2024, so he may have enough time to repair damage and right his ship. But early <strong>omens</strong> are not good. Results of state elections announced on May 2nd left the bjp and allies with just one out of four prizes.</p><p>More tellingly, the party was hammered in West Bengal, the state it had fought hardest to win. This was not a <strong>referendum</strong> on Mr Modi’s handling of the pandemic: many Bengali voters dislike the bjp’s thinly disguised <strong>bigotry</strong> and see its Hindi-speaking, <strong>ostentatiously</strong> religious leaders as culturally alien. The voting was in eight phases, meaning that many ballots were cast before the deadliness of the second wave became clear. Significantly, the margin seems to have widened as the voting went on and deaths mounted. In Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, village-level elections showed a sharp tilt against bjp-endorsed candidates in parts of the state considered its <strong>fiefs</strong>. One of them was Varanasi, Mr Modi’s own parliamentary constituency. </p><p><a id="south-koreans-are-discovering-a-taste-for-instagrammable-interiors"></a></p><h1 id="South-Koreans-are-discovering-a-taste-for-Instagrammable-interiors"><a href="#South-Koreans-are-discovering-a-taste-for-Instagrammable-interiors" class="headerlink" title="South Koreans are discovering a taste for Instagrammable interiors"></a>South Koreans are discovering a taste for Instagrammable interiors</h1><p>A move away from <strong>fluorescent</strong> tubelights is softening the <strong>ambience</strong><br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Walking around Seoul at night, Suzie Son noticed a curious change. The city’s high-rise residential blocks usually emit a harsh white glare from the fluorescent lights fitted in every South Korean flat. But in recent years she has seen an increasing number of soft yellow rectangles appearing in the grids of windows. “My foreign friends always complained about the cold bright light in their homes,” says Ms Son, who runs the lighting division at ikea Korea and goes on night-time walks as part of her market research. “None of the Koreans ever thought about changing them.”</p><p>That is no longer the case, especially among younger Koreans. “I have those bright ceiling lights in my place but I never turn them on,” says Kim Yeon-soo, a 24-year-old <strong>paralegal</strong> who recently moved into a small flat in Seoul. Instead, she uses lamps with low-wattage yellow lights to create what she considers a more calming atmosphere. Her new bed was chosen for the soft, indirect reading light built into the headboard. Her friends have similar tastes, she says: “Young people just pay more attention to light and mood.”</p><p>Their parents are not far behind. Ms Kim says her mother shares her distaste for white lights. A shopkeeper in Euljiro, Seoul’s lighting district, says his most popular product—single-bulb <strong>pendant</strong> lamps inspired by mid-century European designs—is sought by 20-somethings and middle-aged housewives alike.</p><p>Countless pictures of impossibly <strong>sumptuous</strong> interiors, shared on social media, have helped home decor join handbags and cars as a way of displaying status, reckons Minsuk Cho, an architect in Seoul. “People used to pay little attention to their homes in that respect,” he says. Most South Koreans work long hours and socialise outside the home. “But now there’s Instagram and YouTube, so even if you’re rarely there your home is something else you can put on display to compete with others.”</p><p>The pandemic has had an effect as well. Like their counterparts elsewhere, South Koreans have spent more money on their homes the longer they have been stuck in them. Sales in Ms Son’s division rose by 20% over the past year, she says. Department stores run by Lotte, a local <strong>conglomerate</strong>, report a similar increase in demand for lights. Monthly sales of designer lamps at the Conran Shop, a pricey British retailer, have grown five-fold since it opened in Seoul’s glitzy Gangnam district two years ago. Gentice, a <strong>purveyor</strong> of bedroom furniture, is expanding its range of bedside tables “because people want somewhere to put their reading lights”, says a saleswoman at an interior-design fair at a mall in Gangnam.</p><p>Soft yellow lights are casting their glow outside the home, too. Though most Korean restaurants and pubs remain in <strong>thrall</strong> to white striplights and multicoloured leds, the self-consciously hip coffee shops, wine bars and noodle joints popping up across the country are aiming for a more sophisticated vibe. Their owners <strong>scour</strong> traditional markets and the internet for <strong>vintage</strong> Tiffany lamps and <strong>knock-off</strong> versions of Bauhaus light fixtures, importing design trends beloved by cool kids across the globe. For long-suffering <strong>aesthetes</strong> such as Mr Cho, that is some light relief.</p><p><a id="australia%E2%80%99s-debate-about-china-is-becoming-hot-angry-and-shrill"></a></p><h1 id="Australia’s-debate-about-China-is-becoming-hot-angry-and-shrill"><a href="#Australia’s-debate-about-China-is-becoming-hot-angry-and-shrill" class="headerlink" title="Australia’s debate about China is becoming hot, angry and shrill"></a>Australia’s debate about China is becoming hot, angry and shrill</h1><p>The increasingly one-sided discourse helps no one<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>China’s communist party has given Australians plenty to be dismayed about, from its <strong>vituperative</strong> anger when the Dalai Lama visits, to buying off Australian politicians, to trying to influence academic research at Australia’s universities. China is not best pleased, either. In an extraordinary outpouring of <strong>bile</strong> last year, the Chinese <strong>embassy</strong> in Canberra enumerated 14 <strong>grievances</strong> against Australia. These included the passing of a law against foreign interference in politics and calling for an independent international inquiry into the <strong>murky</strong> origins of the novel coronavirus. Putting Australia firmly on the naughty step, China has blocked a <strong>raft</strong> of Australian exports to China, the unlucky country’s biggest trading partner.</p><p>Australia long needed a public debate about China, but politicians were <strong>loth</strong> to <strong>broach</strong> one. Even as China’s power and reach grew under President Xi Jinping, Australia’s leaders, and voters, were happy striking an awkward balance in which it got its prosperity from China—through vast exports of iron ore and coal and imports of Chinese students—and its security from an America-led order. But, given Chinese rage, having it both ways is no longer an option.</p><p>The government of Scott Morrison, prime minister since 2018, <strong>relishes</strong> calling China out. By now, though, the <strong>rhetorical</strong> flourishes are starting to sound as though it were <strong>girding</strong> for war. Mr Morrison says Australia must speak with “one voice” on foreign policy, as if scrappy debate was uncalled for, or even unpatriotic. The new defence secretary, Peter Dutton, told the Sydney Morning Herald ( smh) that Australia was “already under attack” in the cyber domain. He warned that a war over Taiwan could not be discounted and that the priority was defending Australia’s waters. A senior civil servant, Michael Pezzullo, <strong>weighed</strong> in with talk of the “drums of war”, pointing the finger at China without naming it.</p><p>Yet if war is not actually <strong>imminent</strong>, which it is not, then the government line is not helpful. Natasha Kassam of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think-thank, argues in the Guardian that while the reasons for talking about regional challenges are sound, “there are also real risks…from causing panic and hysteria.” Not even Taiwan talks of imminent war.</p><p>Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister and <strong>cogent</strong> observer of China’s rise, goes further. Australia’s “highly <strong>problematic</strong>” relationship with China is certainly because of Mr Xi’s much more <strong>assertive</strong> posture. But it is also, Mr Rudd argues in the smh, because Mr Morrison and his team “are addicted to the drug of ‘standing up to China’.”That may play well at home, but “the public language on China, Taiwan and the possibility of war…serves zero national security purpose.”</p><p>What is more, the line from Canberra poisons a wider domestic discourse over China, in which those arguing for engagement, nuance or open debate are shouted down. A <strong>furore</strong> erupted when Jane Golley, a prominent academic at the Australian National University, argued that debates about China were being <strong>stifled</strong> by a “dominant narrative”. She was perhaps unwise to choose the topic of China’s brutal treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which she does not contest, as her example. But the outcry seemed to bear out her broader point.</p><p>Separately, a researcher and <strong>prolific</strong> <strong>tweeter</strong> at the Parliamentary Library, Geoff Wade, has claimed widespread Communist Party influence over Australian life. When a handful of commentators, including one with former business ties to China, challenged the basis of his claims, Mr Wade issued <strong>defamation</strong> suits against them. James Paterson, a senator who is part of a group of China hawks in Parliament, claimed Mr Wade was the object of “state-backed <strong>coercion</strong>”. (Also without evidence, Mr Wade’s critics counter that murky forces are paying for his legal campaign.)</p><p>One veteran Canberra hand describes a dangerous “ideological intolerance” in which moderate voices are drowned out and the debate about China is reduced to emotion. Another senator, Eric Abetz, last year even called on Chinese-Australians appearing before his committee to <strong>denounce</strong> the Communist Party. That points to a further risk, says Greg Barns, a lawyer: pinko <strong>paranoia</strong> plays to a <strong>xenophobic</strong>, racist undercurrent that has long run through Australian life.</p><p>Such an undercurrent risks resurfacing if Chinese-Australians face questions or abuse about their loyalty. If the hawks’ tactics end up making Australia seem a less civil, tolerant or welcoming place, then the country will be the poorer for it.</p><p><a id="china-pushes-back-against-critics-of-its-policies-in-xinjiang"></a></p><h1 id="China-pushes-back-against-critics-of-its-policies-in-Xinjiang"><a href="#China-pushes-back-against-critics-of-its-policies-in-Xinjiang" class="headerlink" title="China pushes back against critics of its policies in Xinjiang"></a>China pushes back against critics of its policies in Xinjiang</h1><p>This time, it’s personal<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Not long before the Beijing Olympics of 2008, the Chinese government carried out a vicious crackdown on demonstrations in Tibet. Foreign media drew attention to it, and people outside China held protests. A Chinese academic <strong>popularised</strong> the idea of “three <strong>afflictions</strong>”: two that China had faced in the past (“being beaten” by foreign powers and “being starved” by poverty) and a third that it faces now: “being scolded” by the rest of the world. Later President Xi Jinping adopted the concept, arguing that China faces a “fight for international discourse”.</p><p>On no subject has China been more scolded than Xinjiang, where it has interned some 1m Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group, for such things as being too <strong>pious</strong> or talking to relatives overseas. Media in democracies uniformly portray this as a <strong>grotesque</strong> abuse of human rights. The Communist Party is pushing back, in an effort to break what it calls the “discourse hegemony” of the West. To treat the “third affliction” it has <strong>marshalled</strong> vast resources, including official media, think-tanks, diplomats and security organs, and spent billions of dollars over the past decade.</p><p>A notable feature of recent propaganda about Xinjiang has been relentless attacks on China’s critics. In March the government imposed sanctions, such as bans on visiting or doing business with China, on elected officials, researchers and think-tanks in Europe and North America that had caused offence. Chinese officials also stirred up online nationalist boycotts of Western firms that had acknowledged the possibility of Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang’s cotton industry.</p><p>Since then authorities have made Uyghurs in China make videos begging their <strong>dissident</strong> relatives overseas to shut up; announced a lawsuit against Adrian Zenz, a prominent researcher into the abuse of Uyghurs; and harassed a bbc journalist, John Sudworth, into leaving China.</p><p>The campaigns are getting personal. In April Xinhua, the official news agency, called Mr Zenz a “<strong>puppet</strong> of anti-China forces”. An entity called the Xinjiang Development Research Centre issued a report titled “Slanderer Adrian Zenz’s Xinjiang-related <strong>Fallacies</strong> <strong>Versus</strong> the Truth”. Global Times, a party <strong>tabloid</strong>, denounced Vicky Xu, an Australian researcher who has written about forced labour. It accused her of stoking sentiment that puts Chinese people in Australia “in <strong>peril</strong>”, and quoted a Chinese student who said she was “<strong>bewitched</strong> by the anti-China forces in the West”.</p><p>In the past, when the party was accused of specific abuses, its propagandists would issue general denials. They would also try to <strong>recast</strong> <strong>repressive</strong> policies as examples of the party’s wisdom and <strong>munificence</strong>, producing what a vice-president of Xinhua once called “fairy tales”. And they have long tried to change the subject by playing up human-rights abuses in America. State media still produce fairy tales about happy Uyghurs doing traditional dances. But now, at almost any critical mention of Xinjiang, China pushes back hard.</p><p>David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says this <strong>verbal</strong> <strong>ferocity</strong> is partly aimed at a nationalist audience within China, which likes to hear the motherland robustly defended (as does Mr Xi). That helps explain a <strong>blustery</strong> performance by Yang Jiechi, China’s top diplomat, at a summit in Alaska in March with America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken. After Mr Blinken raised the subject of Xinjiang, among other concerns, Mr Yang unleashed an 18-minute <strong>tirade</strong> about the virtues of “Chinese-style democracy” and the <strong>effrontery</strong> of those who try to “<strong>smear</strong>” it.</p><p>A fragmented global media landscape makes it easier to spread disinformation. Conventional outlets are struggling financially, and conspiracy theories proliferate on social media and YouTube. China has spent hundreds of millions of dollars annually over the past decade to take advantage of this, expanding its media footprint abroad under a “Great Foreign Propaganda Campaign”, says a working paper for the Brookings Institution by Rush Doshi (now a China specialist on America’s National Security Council). He notes that, since 2009, Xinhua has doubled the number of its foreign bureaus to 200; China Radio International, a state broadcaster, has more than tripled its hours of programming in 65 languages; and China Global Television Network (cgtn) has established itself as a new brand overseas, with 24 channels in five languages.</p><p>Equally important have been state media’s deals to place content in other media outlets around the globe—what propaganda officials call “borrowing the boats to reach the sea”. China Daily paid handsomely to place inserts in such newspapers as the Washington Post and The Economist (though both ended the arrangement in 2020). Since 2018, Xinhua has struck content-exchange deals with print, radio and television outlets in Australia, Egypt, India, Italy and Nigeria, to name just a few, writes Sarah Cook of Freedom House, a watchdog. She adds that many consumers of these outlets may not know that some of their news (especially about China) comes from Chinese state media.</p><p>The authorities in Beijing recognise that the most persuasive voices are not their own. They prefer to “borrow a mouth to speak”—promoting online the voices of useful foreigners, some of whom have made YouTube videos about their travels in Xinjiang, challenging reports of Uyghur suffering. A particular favourite is the Grayzone, an outlet that has sought to <strong>discredit</strong> the Western narrative on Xinjiang as a product of American imperialism.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the propaganda push does not appear to have won hearts and minds in rich democracies. But bullying critics may work in a way that is hard to measure—that is, in future silence. Many firms were quiet in the wake of the online boycott in China. The Better Cotton Initiative, a global apparel-industry <strong>consortium</strong>, took down an online statement of concern about Xinjiang cotton. In 2019, after an executive of a National Basketball Association team tweeted in support of protests in Hong Kong, China’s main broadcaster stopped showing nba games. Since then, players and executives have been almost completely silent on China.</p><p>“Not only Adrian Zenz, but all anti-China forces who attempt to <strong>inflict</strong> pain on Xinjiang through slanders must pay the price,” Xinhua wrote on April 30th. Such threats may <strong>cow</strong> some critics, but others will be emboldened. The new scold war could last a while. </p><p><a id="why-so-many-young-chinese-seek-plastic-surgery"></a></p><h1 id="Why-so-many-young-Chinese-seek-plastic-surgery"><a href="#Why-so-many-young-Chinese-seek-plastic-surgery" class="headerlink" title="Why so many young Chinese seek plastic surgery"></a>Why so many young Chinese seek plastic surgery</h1><p>It’s not just that they want to stay young<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Hannah tang, a company manager in Beijing, first went under the knife when she was 18. The surgeon made an <strong>incision</strong> across each of her eyelids, then stitched folds of skin back to transform her monolids into “double eyelids”. The result was eyes that look bigger, rounder, and in Ms Tang’s opinion, more beautiful. Now 35, Ms Tang (not her real name) has since had two more eyelid surgeries, as well as botox injections in her neck and monthly non-invasive “skin booster” treatments. “Pretty much everyone I know around me has had fillers or surgery,” she says.</p><p>China’s <strong>cosmetic</strong>-surgery market is booming. Some analysts think it is now the world’s biggest. In 2019 the Chinese “medical-aesthetics” industry (which includes surgery, injections and skin treatments) had revenue of $27bn, around one-fifth of the global total, estimates Deloitte, a consultancy. It reckons the average annual rate of growth in China’s market between 2015 and 2019 was 29%, compared with a global average of around 9%. By 2023, Deloitte estimates revenue will reach $48bn.</p><p>Figures can be vague partly because “there is a huge hidden market” that goes unreported, says Yi Wu of Maastricht University in the Netherlands. For example Dongguan, a city in southern China, has over 6,000 unlicensed clinics but only 43 licensed ones. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery has not included detailed data on China in its global reporting since 2011.</p><p>Starting young is common. In 2020 61% of patients were aged 16-25, up from 48% two years earlier. More than 90% are under 35, and 85% are female. In America, 81% of cosmetic-surgery patients are over 30 and nearly one-quarter are over 55. Ms Wu believes part of the reason young people have surgery is the influence of <strong>Confucian</strong> <strong>parenting</strong>, which means that children grow up without unconditional approval. This normally leads to academic pressure, she says, but it can also be internalised so that children feel the need to improve their appearance from a young age.</p><p>Double-eyelid surgery accounts for half of all treatments. (In America breast augmentations are the most popular procedure, although in 2020, the year of Zoom, more Americans fixed their noses than their breasts.) Some say the desire for rounder eyes is about looking more Western. But women care more about achieving the “golden ratio” of facial proportions, a more Chinese requirement, reckons Joyce Xu, who works in marketing in Beijing.</p><p>The golden ratio is an upside-down triangle: big eyes, relatively flat cheekbones, a narrow jaw and a small mouth. Ms Xu (also not her real name) started Botox injections to that end when she was 27.</p><p>As middle-class incomes have risen, surgery has become more affordable. Ms Xu’s quarterly injections are 3,000-5,000 yuan ($460-770) each time, which she deems a bargain. However, the popularity of such things has led to widespread fakery. An estimated two-thirds of injectables in China are unlicensed. In February Gao Liu, an actress, shared shocking pictures on social media of her <strong>botched</strong> nose job. It resulted in the tissue on the tip of her nose dying and turning black.</p><p>Horror stories such as Ms Gao’s may not slow growth. One consequence of starting on treatments so young is that your “baseline appearance gets forgotten,” notes Ms Wu. As a movie character almost said, there’s a great future in plastic surgery.</p><p><a id="china-wants-the-world-to-know-that-resistance-to-its-rise-is-futile"></a></p><h1 id="China-wants-the-world-to-know-that-resistance-to-its-rise-is-futile"><a href="#China-wants-the-world-to-know-that-resistance-to-its-rise-is-futile" class="headerlink" title="China wants the world to know that resistance to its rise is futile"></a>China wants the world to know that resistance to its rise is futile</h1><p>It should worry more about why it is so distrusted<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Leaders of china and America share an obsession: the notion that a large enough coalition of Western democracies might have the <strong>heft</strong> to confront a rising China about its authoritarian, state-capitalist ways, and demand that it follow a new <strong>trajectory</strong>, one that does less damage to norms and universal values that have governed the rich world since 1945.</p><p>China fears a broad, American-led coalition as the one force that might still be able to contain it. Not so long ago its foreign minister, Wang Yi, mocked the Quad, an informal group uniting America, Australia, India and Japan, as so much “sea foam”. After America hosted a Quad-leaders summit, China has called the group a destabilising scheme to build an Asian <strong>nato</strong>. The Trump administration expanded the role of the Five Eyes, an <strong>intelligence-sharing</strong> pact between America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The group issued a statement in November 2020 about the crushing of political freedoms in Hong Kong. But the Five Eyes should be careful not to be “poked and blinded”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman <strong>growled</strong>. Australia and Canada are being punished with trade sanctions and detention of their citizens to teach them the cost of helping America in disputes with China.</p><p>Under President Joe Biden, American enthusiasm for coalition-building has only grown. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, explained to cbs News recently why America seeks allies to confront China’s government about <strong>repression</strong> at home and aggression overseas, as well as its adversarial approach to trade. “We’re much more effective and stronger when we’re bringing like-minded and similarly aggrieved countries together to say to Beijing: ‘This can’t stand and it won’t stand’,” Mr Blinken said.</p><p>In fact, these two rival powers are obsessing about something that is not likely to happen. For one thing, America’s allies have few illusions that any group of outsiders, even one led from Washington, can tell today’s China what will and will not stand. As a Western diplomat in Beijing <strong>glumly</strong> notes, such countries as Britain, France and Germany “are close to accepting the inevitability of China’s rise”, and so are out of alignment with America. For another, lots of Western democracies are <strong>fractious</strong> and mistrustful, especially after four years of Trumpian bridge-burning. European and Asian democracies alike are <strong>wary</strong> of joining America in anything resembling a cold-war effort to check China’s aggression—especially if it <strong>jeopardises</strong> profitable trade relationships.</p><p>France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said this year that it would be <strong>counter-productive</strong> for Western powers “to join all together against China”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has also spoken out against the “building of <strong>blocs</strong>”. In recent telephone and video calls with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders, there is no record of her raising sweeping sanctions imposed by China on European politicians and researchers, in <strong>retaliation</strong> for eu sanctions targeting officials accused of brutally repressing Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang.</p><p>Official read-outs instead record Mrs Merkel talking of co-operation and praising a draft trade pact agreed with China last year, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which would offer more access to China’s market for some eu firms, notably German carmakers. Ironically, the agreement may be doomed by the sanctions that Mrs Merkel wants to ignore. Those punished by China include members of the European Parliament, which must approve the pact. The eu trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, said on May 4th that efforts to <strong>finalise</strong> the deal are on hold.</p><p>eu unity is further undermined by members with close investment ties to China, such as Greece. One member does not conceal its admiration for Chinese autocracy, charges a European diplomat in Beijing: “The eu has its traitor in the ranks: Hungary.” Nor is there consensus within the Five Eyes. In recent weeks, New Zealand’s government declared itself uncomfortable with the intelligence-sharing pact’s releasing geopolitical statements.</p><p>China loves all such signs of disunity, praising European nations for seeking “strategic autonomy”, a French phrase that means not marching in lockstep with America. Yet in its <strong>paranoia</strong> about American-led alliances bent on containment, China risks missing a change that is actually happening in the real world.</p><p>Even as they concede that the time for trying to change China is over, rich-world democracies are defensively China-proofing their economies and their societies. They are setting up new investment-screening laws, investigating whether foreign powers are <strong>meddling</strong> in their domestic politics and universities, and writing public-procurement rules to block bidders who raise national-security concerns. The eu is proposing new curbs on state-subsidised firms wanting to compete in European markets. Such policies do not always name China, but it is the target.</p><p>Standing together, sort of<br>Foreign ministers of the g7 countries—America, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan—met in London on May 3rd-5th. Their closing communiqué condemns Chinese abuses in Xinjiang, including “the existence of a large-scale network of ‘political re-education’ camps, and reports of forced labour systems and forced <strong>sterilisation</strong>”. The solutions offered are purely defensive, and make no pretence that the g7 can change Chinese policies. The risk of importing goods made with forced labour will have to be tackled through “our own available domestic means”, the ministers say, by raising awareness and advising businesses.</p><p>Such words do not frighten China. Confident in the power offered by its vast market, it hopes that foreign governments will hurry up and realise that resistance to its rise is futile. If resistance means forming blocs to contain China, then America’s allies already agree. But those same democracies are also <strong>channelling</strong> a growing distrust into defences that will introduce new frictions into relations with China. Friction is a form of resistance, too.</p>]]></content>

That dynamic is changing<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Serfing the web(网上摸鱼)</p><p>“Look at you down there, trying to run for your life,” <strong>jeers</strong> Summer Solesis, peering down at the camera. “You don’t stand a chance against my giant, size 11 feet!” Standing over her phone, she pretends to stamp on the viewer, who gets the effect—sort of—that Ms Solesis is a “giantess with dirty feet getting rid of the tiny men <strong>infesting</strong> my house”, as one video is captioned. The production quality is low-fi, but viewers seem not to mind. “Unforgettable sweet crushing,” <strong>swoons</strong> one fan, Sven, in the comments below.</p><p>The <strong>pseudonymous</strong> Ms Solesis, a personable 26-year-old Floridian, reinvented herself as an online “foot goddess” last March after covid-19 did for her restaurant job. “My mom’s just always told me I had pretty feet,” she says. So “I was just like, well, let’s see if the internet thinks I have pretty feet.” It did. On Instagram she gained 20,000 followers. Some offered money for personalised photos and videos. A few months later she joined OnlyFans, a London-based subscription platform. About 50 people around the world pay $10 a month for Ms Solesis’s newsfeed, adding up to around $5,000 a year after OnlyFans takes its 20% cut. She roughly doubles that with tips and <strong>merchandise</strong>, including unwashed socks ($10 per day worn).</p><p>In the past decade anyone with a phone has become a potential content creator. Cameras have got sharper, processors more powerful and networks faster. Apps can improve even the <strong>shoddiest</strong> content. Instagram, launched in 2010, provided filters that made ordinary photos look cool. TikTok has made it as simple to edit video. In April Facebook unveiled recording tools that aim to do for amateur podcasters what Instagram did for bad photographers. The internet’s limitless, free distribution and searchability has made it possible for this output—videos, music, jokes, <strong>rants</strong> and all manner of things that defy categorisation—to find an audience, however <strong>niche</strong>.</p><p>Yet apart from a few megastar “influencers”, most creators receive no reward beyond the thrill of <strong>notching up</strong> “likes”. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has built a $92bn-per-year advertising business by selling space alongside posts by its 2.8bn happily unpaid user-suppliers. Twitter makes $3.4bn a year <strong>flogging</strong> ads among the free editorial typed by its 350m contributors. Being on the platform can feel like “the greatest unpaid <strong>internship</strong> of all”, Samhita Mukhopadhyay, an American journalist, recently tweeted.</p><p>But the serfs tilling the internet are increasingly finding that their output can command a price, with the effect that some of the internet’s most successful companies are being forced to adapt their business model. New platforms are offering creators ways to capture the value of their output for themselves, as Ms Solesis did when she moved from Instagram to OnlyFans. Bloggers and tweeters are moving their <strong>musings</strong> to paid newsletter services like Substack; amateur video-game makers are selling their <strong>pixelated</strong> creations on platforms like Roblox; viewers are paying to watch experts play them on streaming services like Twitch, owned by Amazon.</p><p>The <strong>upstarts</strong> are forcing <strong>incumbents</strong> such as Facebook to <strong>compensate</strong> users for the unpaid work they may not have realised they were doing. And they are helping professional creators, who once relied on middlemen, reach their audience directly.</p><p>The abundance of content in the internet age has meant that the success of online media platforms has depended on their ability to help users discover it. Rather than commissioning videos or articles, they have focused on building algorithms or content-management systems which serve users the best of others’ creations.</p><p>One consequence of the internet is that “value has shifted away from companies that control the distribution of <strong>scarce</strong> resources to those that control demand for abundant ones,” writes Ben Thompson, author of the tech newsletter, Stratechery, who calls such firms “aggregators”. Because the platform sets the conditions for a piece of content’s success, via its algorithm, suppliers have to adapt to its rules, thus commoditising themselves. In this world of abundant supply, content providers become as interchangeable, and have as little bargaining power, as Uber drivers.</p><p>All things are become new<br>Yet something in this model is changing. Though there is more content than ever, platforms are competing harder than ever to get it. “There’s an arms race to acquire creators,” says Li Jin, founder of Atelier Ventures, a venture-capital firm. Startups are developing new ways for creators to <strong>monetise</strong> their work. Substack gives writers 90% of the subscription fees they charge for newsletters; together its top ten authors earn more than $15m a year. Twitch gives its game streamers more than half of its subscription fees, plus a cut of ad revenue and the money paid to “cheer” their performance. Cameo, a platform on which 40,000 celebrities sell personalised videos to fans, passes 75% of the spoils to contributors. Brian Baumgartner, an actor in “The Office”, an American sitcom, was its top earner last year, making over $1m. Clubhouse, a social-audio app, allows tips and has an “accelerator programme” for <strong>promising</strong> hosts. It plans to test features such as tickets and subscriptions.</p><p>In response, platforms that once paid little or nothing to creators are <strong>ponying up</strong>. Companies “need to either offer some way to monetise that content on-platform, or…they’ll become just a <strong>promotional</strong> hub, where people essentially advertise the content that they’re monetising on other platforms,” says Josh Constine of SignalFire, another venture-capital firm.</p><p>Twitter was in danger of becoming a promotional tool for Substack writers and Clubhouse broadcasters. It is now trying to beat both at their own game. In January it bought Revue, a newsletter firm, and cut its commission to 5%, half Substack’s. On May 3rd it added Spaces, a Clubhouse-like audio feature; soon it will let users sell tickets to chats they host. The ability to sign up for a newsletter or join an audio room directly from Twitter, without the <strong>friction</strong> of moving apps, <strong>gives the company an edge</strong> over its startup rivals, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a research firm.</p><p>Facebook is also trying to make creators stick around. Last year it made paid subscriptions widely available and enabled tips. It is now testing a Cameo-like feature called “Super”, a Substack-esque newsletter platform, and is paying gamers big bucks to join Facebook Gaming, its <strong>tribute</strong> to Twitch. In all, it says, the number of content-makers earning over $1,000 a month on the platform almost doubled in 2020.</p><p>“In developing all of these things, we’re actually really focused on the creator side, even more than on the consumption side,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, in a recent interview with Casey Newton, author of the Platformer newsletter. In an effort to attract more of them, it is offering creators not just money but power: newsletter authors will own their recipient list and be able to take it to another platform, the equivalent of being allowed to move one’s Facebook friends over to Twitter.</p><p>YouTube, which has long given regular video-posters a 55% cut of ad revenue, is developing new features including tips in the form of paid “applause”. It says the number of channels joining its paid “partner programme” in 2020 was more than double that in 2019. In all it has paid contributors $30bn in ad-revenue shares and subscription fees in the past three years, far more than any other social platform. Last year TikTok, a short-video app, launched a “creator fund” which it says will <strong>dispense</strong> more than $2bn to users in its first three years. Douyin, its Chinese twin, is investing $1.5bn with the aim of doubling its creators’ revenues. Snapchat, another social-video app, last year launched Spotlight, a sharing feature through which it is paying $1m a day to the creators of its most popular clips.</p><p>Newer types of media are joining in. Douyu and Huya, China’s largest game-streaming platforms, each paid out 7.1bn yuan ($1.1bn) to streamers last year, 31% more than in 2019. Spotify and Apple, the two biggest podcast platforms, are <strong>wooing</strong> amateur broadcasters. Last month Apple announced that it would let podcasters charge subscription fees, of which it would take a 30% cut for the first year, then dropping to 15%; days later Spotify followed suit—but said creators could keep the lot (from 2023 it will take 5%).</p><p>As platforms fight over the most popular content, bargaining power is being transferred to the people who make it. Simon Kemp of Kepios, an internet research firm, compares platforms’ <strong>negotiations</strong> with top creators to tv networks’ wrangling with the cast of “Friends” over each season’s contracts. Many offer better terms to their most successful creators: Twitch reportedly pays a higher share of subscription revenues to its top streamers; Substack offers advances to writers it believes will be a hit. The share of revenue that creators can earn seems to depend on how easily they could leave. Moving one’s email list away from Substack is simple, so the firm lets writers keep 90% of their revenues. Game-makers on Roblox, who are basically stuck there, keep about 25%.</p><p>The dancers of TikTok and pranksters of YouTube, whose popularity rises or falls on the <strong>tweak</strong> of a recommendation algorithm, may seem easily replaceable. In reality, the opportunities for interaction with online stars may make their audiences more loyal than those of other celebrities, Mr Kemp points out. Jennifer Aniston and her buddies were in people’s sitting rooms for half an hour a week. Charli D’Amelio, TikTok’s top bopper, is in their pockets all day. “After a decade of building their audiences, a class of Super Creators have emerged that have <strong>leverage</strong> over their aggregators,” wrote Rameez Tase, head of Antenna, an audience-measurement company, in a recent blog post. “They simply built such large, engaged audiences that those audiences would follow them anywhere.”</p><p>A great <strong>multitude</strong><br>Yet what of those creators with more modest followings? A few online stars earn megabucks, but the tail is long (see charts). Spotify says it wants to give “a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art”. But only about 0.2% of the 7m-plus musicians on the platform make more than $50,000 a year in royalties; just 3% make more than $1,000. There are 20m gaming “experiences” on Roblox, but nearly 15% of all play takes place on one game, “Brookhaven rp”, according to analysis by Ran Mo of Electronic Arts, a game developer. On Patreon, where people can subscribe to creative services of all sorts, 200,000 creators earn a total of $1bn a year. The top earner makes around $2m, but about 98% make less than the federal minimum wage of $1,257 a month.</p><p>The main way to monetise online content has been advertising. Making real money requires a huge audience: even 1m views on YouTube might make the poster only about $2,000. Some types of content attract even lower ad rates. PornHub says its amateur contributors earn an average of $0.60 per 1,000 views; 1m hits would net just $600. Ads can make megastars rich, but cannot provide a living for small-time foot goddesses and other niche creators.</p><p>The trend towards subscriptions, and other models of monetisation, is changing that, bringing with it the possibility of a creator middle class. Consider Craig Morgan. The sports journalist was laid off last year by the Athletic, an online publication, after the pandemic put live sport on hold. A friend suggested he try writing a newsletter. az Coyotes Insider was launched on Substack in July. Its detailed updates about a single National Hockey League team—everything from goaltender Darcy Kuemper’s knee injury to the immigration <strong>woes</strong> of defenceman Ilya Lyubushkin—are not designed for a wide audience. But with a subscription model, they don’t need one.</p><p>Ten months on, Mr Morgan has more than 1,000 people paying a minimum of $5 a month (about 18% voluntarily pay more, he says), close to his old salary on the Athletic. Mr Morgan misses bouncing ideas off colleagues, and the safety-net of an editor. But he can write what he likes—and, he adds, “No one can lay me off anymore.”</p><p>Mr Morgan is a living example of the observation in 2008 by Kevin Kelly, a technology writer, that any artist could make a living with just “1,000 true fans” willing to spend $100 a year or so on whatever the creator makes. With that, he wrote, “You can make a living—if you are content to make a living but not a fortune.” The broadening range of online monetisation methods is making it easier to <strong>wring</strong> that sort of money out of devotees. Video-gamers can top up the money they make from streaming by working as paid <strong>wingmen</strong> on gaming platforms such as China’s Heizhu Esports. Some creators see non-fungible tokens, a method of certifying digital creations, as a way to earn more from their superfans. With platforms like Teachable or Podia, which deal in pricey online courses, creators can plausibly get by with more like 100 true fans, Ms Jin reckons.</p><p>The more possible it becomes to make a living out of online content, the more <strong>precarious</strong> becomes the position of the companies that have acted as intermediaries between creators and consumers. Newspapers, which solved a physical distribution problem that no individual writer could hope to overcome, are one example. Substack’s leaderboard includes journalists such as Glenn Greenwald and Matthew Yglesias who have found that readers are willing to pay them far more than the outlets that used to employ them (and that newsletters give them greater editorial freedom, too). Some newspapers, most recently the New York Times, have forbidden writers from launching personal newsletters without permission. A <strong>tyrannical</strong> few deny their writer-serfs <strong>bylines</strong>, ensuring that the value from every article accrues to the brand and not the author.</p><p>Record labels are another endangered middleman. They have historically taken care of turning a song into a hit, in return for an ongoing share of revenues. But more and more artists are going it alone. More than 60,000 new songs are uploaded to Spotify every day, most by bedroom-based rockstars who can use new online services to handle the <strong>logistics</strong> themselves. UnitedMasters, a music-distribution platform which bills itself as “a record label in your pocket”, recently raised $50m in a venture-capital round led by Apple. Tools like Splice make recording easier. Companies like Fanjoy take care of merchandise.</p><p>And financing is getting simpler. One startup, hifi, helps artists manage their <strong>royalties</strong>, paying them regularly and fronting them small sums to make up shortfalls. Another, Karat, extends credit to creators based on their follower count. Helped by such services independent artists took home 5.1% of global recorded music revenues last year, up from 1.7% in 2015, calculates midia Research, a <strong>consultancy</strong>. In the same period the share of the three largest record labels fell from 71.1% to 65.5%.</p><p>What has been will be again<br>Just as the internet allowed brands to bypass physical shops and sell directly to customers online, social platforms “offer a path for creators to communicate directly with their audience,” says Mr Shmulik. Yet they still need the new media platforms, which are becoming more like old media companies. Rather than simply helping consumers navigate a mass of commoditised online content, they play an active role in commissioning and <strong>curating</strong> it.</p><p>Substack insists that advances are determined by “business decisions, not editorial ones”. Yet it offers writers mentoring and legal advice, and will soon provide editing services. YouTubers can post what they like, within broad guidelines, but they cannot monetise content around what YouTube deems “controversial” subjects, including abortion. Twitch has imposed rules for its streamers’ behaviour offline. On May 5th Facebook’s “oversight board”, which rules on editorial matters, upheld Donald Trump’s ban from the platform.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg has said that his social network ought to be treated like something between a phone company, through which information merely flows, and a newspaper, which has editorial control of its content. As his and other platforms more actively court and compensate creators, they are moving further towards the newspaper end of that <strong>continuum</strong>. </p><p><a id="american-home-ownership-rises"></a></p><h1 id="American-home-ownership-rises"><a href="#American-home-ownership-rises" class="headerlink" title="American home-ownership rises"></a>American home-ownership rises</h1><p>After years of decline, American home-ownership is rising<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>During the pandemic America’s housing market has behaved oddly. Prices have increased rapidly, even as the economy fell off a cliff, defying predictions. In contrast with the last recession, few people have <strong>defaulted</strong> on their mortgages. A less-noticed trend is that the home-ownership rate has jumped (see chart). Part of the apparent increase, especially the enormous rise in the second quarter of 2020, is a statistical <strong>mirage</strong>: the pandemic made it hard to collect data, meaning that home-owners were <strong>oversampled</strong> in the surveys. Yet there is little doubt that a genuine surge in home-ownership is under way.</p><p>Politicians the world over would welcome such a rise, believing that owning a house turns people into model citizens. The evidence for this is surprisingly weak—and other research suggests that home-ownership has some negative consequences too, such as less entrepreneurial spirit and unwillingness to move in order to find work.</p><p>Yet rising home-ownership may <strong>bode well</strong> for America’s economic recovery from the pandemic. Home-owners are likelier than renters to live in single-family homes. This encourages the construction of such houses, instead of other types. And this, in turn, is likely to boost gdp, because single-family homes tend to be higher-quality and have more <strong>amenities</strong>. Spending per <strong>completion</strong> is almost 50% higher for single-family units than for multifamily ones, according to a paper published in 2017 by Goldman Sachs, a bank.</p><p>The pandemic has boosted home-ownership for a number of reasons. People’s preferences have shifted. In a world of stay-at-home orders and social distancing, security of <strong>tenure</strong> may be even more desirable than it was before (being <strong>evicted</strong> in the middle of a pandemic is grim). Families who have cut back on meals out and holidays have also accumulated more savings for a deposit (down-payment), making it easier to clamber onto the housing ladder. Generous fiscal-stimulus handouts have also helped swell households’ savings accounts. Interest rates on mortgages have fallen sharply.</p><p>Yet the rise in home-ownership <strong>predates</strong> the pandemic by a few years, meaning that other factors must also be in play. One relates to the last recession, more than a decade ago. From 2007 <strong>onwards</strong> many home-owners found themselves underwater and were forced to <strong>foreclose</strong>. This process, however, took many painful years to play out, reducing the home-ownership rate until about 2016-17. In addition, for much of the 2010s mortgage-lending standards were tight, making it difficult for a new generation of home-owners to emerge. Only in the latter part of that decade did lending conditions loosen sufficiently to allow the home-ownership rate to increase once again.</p><p>Long-term <strong>demographic</strong> change is another important factor behind America’s rising home-ownership rate. Millennials, on average, are less likely to be home-owners than their parents were at the same age. Blame that in part on high levels of student debt, which make other sorts of borrowing difficult. Nonetheless the millennial generation is entering its prime home-buying period (the median age of a first-time home-buyer is 34). After falling prior to 2012, the share of 30-somethings in the overall American population is now rising.</p><p>How much higher could home-ownership go? The biggest impediment could prove to be the supply of available homes. People cannot become home-owners if they have nowhere to move to. The number of houses available to buy is now near historical lows. Yet there are some signs of a revival in home-building; in January the number of new authorised housing permits hit its highest level since before the financial crisis of 2007-09. Housing starts, meanwhile, are also looking surprisingly strong. America’s home-ownership surge could last for a while yet.</p><p><a id="joe-biden%E2%80%99s-government-has-not-yet-committed-to-a-path-on-trade-in-technology-with-china"></a></p><h1 id="Joe-Biden’s-government-has-not-yet-committed-to-a-path-on-trade-in-technology-with-China"><a href="#Joe-Biden’s-government-has-not-yet-committed-to-a-path-on-trade-in-technology-with-China" class="headerlink" title="Joe Biden’s government has not yet committed to a path on trade in technology with China"></a>Joe Biden’s government has not yet committed to a path on trade in technology with China</h1><p>To understand which way it will jump, watch the <strong>hitherto</strong> <strong>obscure</strong> Bureau of Industry and Security<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The process of filling <strong>vacancies</strong> at the Bureau of Industry and Security (bis) does not normally make the news. An agency of the Department of Commerce, bis is tasked with running America’s export-control regulations. These rules were originally designed to prevent the <strong>components</strong> of weapons of mass destruction from being shipped off to terrorists. The work of overseeing them was important public service, but carried out in the background, away from the public eye.</p><p>Donald Trump’s presidency changed that. He and the China <strong>hawks</strong> in his administration repurposed bis and its regulations as a weapon against China’s technological ascendancy. They rewrote the rules several times between 2018 and 2020 in an escalating series of attempts to cut off Huawei, a Chinese technology giant, from global semiconductor supply chains. Huawei has reported declining revenue in its two most recent financial quarters as a result, proving that America can use export controls to disrupt Chinese technological development, at least in the short term.</p><p>This put bis right in the middle of America’s biggest foreign-policy challenge, containing China’s rise. Speculation about its leadership began soon after Mr Biden took office. But the <strong>chaotic</strong> methods of Mr Trump’s administration created a new political dynamic around the agency. The repurposing of regulations often left gaps between what the new rules actually said and what the Trump administration claimed they meant for China in speeches and press releases. Lawyers advised their clients to follow the rules to the letter, thereby allowing them to carry on doing business with Chinese entities where it was still legal to do so.</p><p>The result is that many export-control experts were seen as “soft on China”. On May 4th a Republican congressman from Texas, Michael McCaul, called on the president to nominate a candidate that has “real national-security experience, deep knowledge of the ccp, and will not be conflicted by deep ties to industry”.</p><p>It is this sort of <strong>rhetoric</strong> that has driven the administration’s consideration of “outsider” candidates who do not carry the damaging expert label. The <strong>archetype</strong> is James Mulvenon, a defence analyst who became known in Washington last year for authorship of a report linking smic, China’s leading chipmaker, with the People’s Liberation Army. That Mr Mulvenon has even been under consideration demonstrates how far the role of bis and the politics around it have shifted, as he is not a lawyer and has no experience administering or complying with export-control regulations. Barack Obama appointed a lawyer, George W. Bush a tech-company boss. The post was vacant for most of Mr Trump’s term; hence, in part, the chaos.</p><p>Political appointees do not determine policy, but rather implement what flows from the government, and from the National Security Council (nsc) in particular. Mr Biden’s nsc contains plenty of expertise on China and technology. Saif Khan, the council’s Director for Technology and National Security, published a paper in January which laid out a plan for <strong>curtailing</strong> Chinese semiconductor development. Its other members want to develop a tough new line, less for the industrial-competition reasons that motivated Mr Trump and his administration than because of the technology-enabled human-rights abuses that the Chinese government is <strong>perpetrating</strong> in Xinjiang and beyond. Yet the plan, at present, appears to be unfinished. People close to Mr Biden’s staff say that policy on China and technology remains undecided.</p><p>The choice of an under-secretary to run bis, when it is made, will be a sign of whether the Biden administration has a real plan. If the president chooses someone with little to no experience with export-control law, but who has a hard line on China, that will indicate that domestic politics are dominating the administration’s thinking and that it lacks the confidence to <strong>fend off</strong> critics like Mr McCaul. The appointment of someone who knows the law and can carry out the government’s bidding quickly would suggest that Mr Biden does, indeed, have a plan for redrawing the lines of technological trade with China, and that he intends to use the most experienced people possible to do so. </p><p><a id="in-praise-of-america%E2%80%99s-founding-fish"></a></p><h1 id="In-praise-of-America’s-founding-fish"><a href="#In-praise-of-America’s-founding-fish" class="headerlink" title="In praise of America’s founding fish"></a>In praise of America’s founding fish</h1><p>The <strong>Potomac</strong> river is a more vivid symbol of American history than any of the monuments along it<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Since march 12th, when the first hickory <strong>shad</strong> of the year <strong>succumbed</strong> to a sparkly <strong>lure</strong>, <strong>anglers</strong> of both sexes, several races and all sizes have been lining the bank of the Potomac in Washington, dc, like salmon-hungry bears. When early-bird attorney anglers leave for the office their spots are taken by mask-wearing housewives from Bethesda. <strong>Frazzled</strong> <strong>lobbyists</strong> (who prefer the river to the swamp) silently cast their <strong>fluorescent</strong> <strong>jigs</strong> alongside <strong>grizzled</strong> Trump voters from Virginia, and also three-generational Hispanic families, with their umbrellas and coolers and music.</p><p>Lexington and his children are sometimes among them. Any fool can catch a shad when the mood takes it. Hence the popularity of the fish, a sort of outsized <strong>herring</strong> that migrates up America’s east-coast rivers to <strong>spawn</strong>. And the deep, <strong>churning</strong> three-mile <strong>stretch</strong> of the Potomac that runs from Fletcher’s Boathouse, at the top of Georgetown, to the Little Falls dam is some of the best shad water there is. ‘It’s kind of sad,” says Alex Binsted, who caught that first hickory and is, at 34, a master angler, “but I’ve caught 95% of every fish I’ve ever caught right here.” He gestures, as he rows, to a 100-yard stretch of river in front of the <strong>boathouse</strong>, which has been renting wooden fishing skiffs to Washingtonians since the mid-19th century and which he now manages. “When the fishing’s so good here, why go elsewhere?”</p><p>An <strong>osprey</strong> and juvenile eagle circle, looking for exhausted fish, as Mr Binsted noses the boat onto the skirt of the current, where a line of skiffs are anchored. “Hey Lois!” he calls out to a small white-haired woman, a retired patent lawyer who is known as the “shad queen”. This is where the serious fishing takes place, among Fletcher’s “inner circle”, whose members know shad—where they lie and when and how to induce a reluctant bite—almost as well as each other. “Hey Dad!” Mr Binsted hollers at another boat. Within a minute he is into the first of a dozen silver American shad, the biggest of the species, two-to-six pounds of ocean-going muscle. Your columnist, fishing the same lures in the same spot, and so far as he can tell in exactly the same way, draws a blank.</p><p>Americans know Washington for its monuments. Yet the capital’s closeness to nature—on a vast and <strong>fecund</strong> American scale—is far more unusual. Kinshasa, skirted by the turbid Congo river, is one of the few great riverine cities that compares to it. And this <strong>proximity</strong> is as <strong>redolent</strong> of history as any memorial. The Potomac’s fishy <strong>bounty</strong> was one of the earliest and most fabulous New World discoveries. In 1608 John Smith of the Jamestown colony described trying to <strong>ladle</strong> shad aboard his boat with a frying-pan, so <strong>thick</strong> was the river with them. Intercepting the migrating fish, by brush trap, weir and horse-drawn net, was soon an industry of continental importance.</p><p>Following their native guides (who called the shad “Tatamaho”—“Inside-out porcupine”), the Pilgrim Fathers <strong>manured</strong> their fields with shad. George Washington’s wealth was based on his shad fisheries; his troops at Valley Forge were said to have <strong>gorged</strong> on the fish. So did William Penn, Thomas Jefferson (born in Shadwell, Virginia), Abraham Lincoln and so many other great men that the shad has been called the “founding fish”. In 1823, 110m pounds of it were harvested from the Potomac. To watch the river boiling with spawning fish is to connect with that history.</p><p>It is also to contemplate a great conservation success, however. During the 19th century, a time of dam-building, Potomac shad stocks fell by over 80%. By the 1960s, the river had become so black with pollution that Lyndon Johnson termed it a “national disgrace”. The shad, a species more numerous and <strong>formative</strong> than the <strong>bison</strong>, was almost <strong>eradicated</strong> from it. Yet this helped spur the Clean Water Act of 1972, which began a cleanup of America’s rivers. And that federal law was in turn augmented, along the Potomac and elsewhere, by local authorities and an army of volunteers.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s Washington, Maryland and Virginia closed their shad fisheries and cut a fish-passage through the Little Falls dam. Shad roe was later milked from fish caught downstream, hatched in Washington’s schools, and millions of fry released into the river’s upper stretches. The tactic worked. By the early 2000s the <strong>shoals</strong> were recovering so strongly that Potomac shad roe was being <strong>carted</strong> to other <strong>depleted</strong> rivers.</p><p>This success has helped spawn a culture, as well as fish. For centuries, individual shad were valued in proportion to their <strong>plenitude</strong>. The first president fed the fish to his slaves; but he himself preferred to eat beef and angle for trout. Hardly anyone fished for shad with a <strong>rod</strong> until the 20th century. Yet the fish’s brush with extinction has encouraged a new understanding of its qualities. Its <strong>seminal</strong> role in the ecology of east-coast rivers is now manifest—and illustrated by flourishing birdlife wherever it has returned. Its sporting qualities are equally prized.</p><p>Scales of justice<br>For shadding <strong>greenhorns</strong>, it may be enough that when the fish chooses to bite, it is hard not to catch. For experts, when and why it sometimes snaps at a green <strong>dart</strong> but not a red one, then vice versa, before it suddenly stops snapping altogether, is as fascinating as its fight is daunting. “Look at how it’s using the current!” cries Mr Binsted respectfully, while <strong>tussling</strong> with his <strong>umpteenth</strong> fish (each of which he returns tenderly to the water).</p><p>Henry Thoreau, a great fish lover, predicted the much-abused shad, “armed only with innocence and a just cause”, was “reserved for higher destinies”. He has been proved right. Continent-wide, the founding fish is still struggling. But, year-by-year, its recovery is continuing on the Potomac and spreading further. Last year the shad and other migratory fish were free to swim up the Brandywine <strong>Creek</strong> in Delaware for the first time in 300 years. The founding fish appears to have been saved and at last appreciated. It is a story of fruitful co-operation and hopeful progress, <strong>emanating</strong> from a city too rarely known for either.</p><p><a id="black-americans-spend-more-of-the-day-being-kept-waiting"></a></p><h1 id="Black-Americans-spend-more-of-the-day-being-kept-waiting"><a href="#Black-Americans-spend-more-of-the-day-being-kept-waiting" class="headerlink" title="Black Americans spend more of the day being kept waiting"></a>Black Americans spend more of the day being kept waiting</h1><p>Numbers from the Bureau of Labour Statistics show how time is wasted by race and class<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Time should be a great <strong>leveller</strong>. Jeff Bezos or Amazon warehouse clerk, everyone gets 24 hours a day. But worse-off Americans have more of their time wasted just waiting around.</p><p>Poorer people have to wait longer for basic services. Low-income neighbourhoods often have fewer shops and medical centres, with fewer staff on hand and crowds at their doors. The worse-off claim unemployment benefits or food stamps, which means interacting with <strong>creaky</strong> government administration. And low-wage jobs come with rigid hours, which make it difficult to take an extended lunch break and pop to the bank when it’s quiet. The time <strong>squandered</strong> in delays could be better spent working, studying or just kicking back with a beer, points out Stephen Holt at the University at Albany. “Time is a finite resource,” he says. “It’s something you just don’t get back.” (Which is why this article is so concise.)</p><p>It was when Mr Holt’s partner came home <strong>fuming</strong> from the crowded local optician that he began <strong>crunching</strong> the data. Americans who make less than $20,000 a year spend around 46 minutes a day waiting for basic services like child care, health care and groceries, according to Mr Holt’s analysis of Bureau of Labour Statistics (bls) surveys. That is almost 12 minutes more than those earning over $150,000 a year. The gap adds up to an extra hour and 20 minutes a week or ten full working days per year. Add the time spent waiting for transport, and the inequality would probably be even worse.</p><p>Rich or poor, Americans may have it better than others. In Britain, where queuing is a national pastime, a survey found the average person wastes 44 hours a year waiting. However this included time spent in traffic, which the estimates for America leave out, perhaps on the grounds that caraoke and texting really ought to count as time well-spent.</p><p>In America, it is the difference across racial groups that is most striking. Mr Holt’s calculations suggest wealthy white Americans get what they want quickly. But among black Americans, those earning at least $150,000 actually spend more time cooling their heels than those earning $20,000 or less. That could be because they live in under-served <strong>predominantly</strong> black neighbourhoods, but use services like shops and salons more often. Whether it’s about being asked to produce more paperwork for a mortgage or waiting while someone white is bumped to the front of the queue, says Elizabeth Cohen, a professor at Syracuse University and author of “The Political Value of Time”, “waiting is part of the experience of racism in the US”.</p><p>Darren Hromadka, founder of InLine4You, sees it first-hand. It was this week four years ago at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting that he got the idea for his business. The Omaha resident spotted investors paying people to wait in line overnight to <strong>bag a plum spot</strong> when Warren Buffett took to the stage. His app extends that service to all sorts of other things, from gigs and new iPhone launches to coronavirus tests.</p><p>Mr Hromadka has spotted a trend: it is almost always white Americans who pay for so-called “line-standing” services. Meanwhile, 80% of those willing to wait around for $25-100 an hour are black or Hispanic. “Minorities are used to waiting for things,” he says.</p><p><a id="america%E2%80%99s-homicide-rate-has-declined-since-the-1990s-so-have-homicide-clearance-rates"></a></p><h1 id="America’s-homicide-rate-has-declined-since-the-1990s-So-have-homicide-clearance-rates"><a href="#America’s-homicide-rate-has-declined-since-the-1990s-So-have-homicide-clearance-rates" class="headerlink" title="America’s homicide rate has declined since the 1990s.

They show her oldest and youngest brothers, Larry Miller and Harrol Berry, and her son Courtney Williams. All were murdered in 2014. Mr Miller was stabbed while in prison; two people have been tried for his murder. The killers of Mr Berry and Mr Williams, who was shot on a visit home from college, have never been caught.</p><p>Sadly, that is not unusual. St Louis is a violent city, and its homicide unit is overworked and <strong>understaffed</strong>. Ideally, a homicide detective should be the primary investigator on no more than five murders per year. Heather Taylor, a recently retired homicide supervisor in St Louis, said that her detectives had as many as 19.</p><p>Last year, 262 people were killed in St Louis, giving it a murder rate of 87.2 per 100,000 people—probably higher than any other American city. But police in the city cleared (meaning, generally, arrested and charged someone for) just 36% of those homicides. By contrast, last year police in St Louis County, just west of the city, closed 87% of their murders. As of May 3rd this year, things are looking up, but police have still closed only 31 of the city’s 68 murders.</p><p>This problem is not unique to St Louis. Nationally, around two in every five murders go unsolved, with troubling consequences for families, neighbourhoods and cities all over the country.</p><p>This was not always the case. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St Louis, notes that up until the early 1980s homicide-clearance rates in many cities were around 90%. Then, beginning in the 1990s, crime of all sorts began to decline—but so did clearance rates.</p><p>Murders within families and marriages, which are comparatively easy to solve, decreased. Murders involving drugs and gangs (in which victims, offenders and those with knowledge of the crime might all have criminal records, and hence want to avoid the police) came to <strong>comprise</strong> a larger share of all homicides. Those killings are harder to solve, and in any given year, when murders rise, clearance rates tend to fall, suggesting that more murders stretch police manpower, resulting in fewer clearances.</p><p>What explains the low rates in St Louis? “Fear,” says Sharon Williams. Her apartment is <strong>festooned</strong> with pictures of her oldest son Mikey, an artist and painter shot to death by young men who mistakenly believed he had stolen some guns or drugs. Ms Williams used to run a gang-abatement centre in north St Louis; her son’s funeral was the 46th she had attended for a young person killed in the city. In many cases, she explains, just because the murder is officially unsolved does not mean the killer is unknown. People say to themselves, “I live in this neighbourhood. I work in this neighbourhood. My kids go to school here. We know the <strong>perpetrators</strong>; we just can’t say it. Nobody’s offering us protection.”</p><p>Kim Gardner, St Louis’s chief prosecutor, agrees, arguing that Missouri does not give her office adequate resources to protect or move witnesses. Mr Rosenfeld calls this “a genuine chicken-and-egg problem. When overall levels of violence come down, people become more willing to co-operate with the police because the neighbourhood is less risky. But how do you drive down the level of violence? People have to co-operate with the police.”</p><p>As a result, families often see their loved ones’ killers walk free. Ms Williams has spoken with other grieving families who say, “We know where the person is, but we’re trying to do things the right way. We don’t want to take street justice, but nobody is helping us.”</p><p>Mistrust, built up over decades, between the city’s majority-white police force and the majority-black population of north St Louis also makes people reluctant to come forward. One St Louis-based fbi agent argues that “failure to handle violent crime invalidated everything else. Too many police officers try to reduce violent crimes by saying, ’We’ll knock more heads’.” This agent favours a programme of “focused <strong>deterrence</strong> [and] call-ins”, in which police bring in young men at risk of perpetrating or being victims of violent crime to offer them job training and other social services, but also to warn them that if they continue on their current path, they will face serious consequences. The fbi agent says a former police chief deemed that plan “too soft”.</p><p>But a strategy like this has worked before. In the early 2000s, St Louis had more people and fewer murders (its murder rate in 2003 was less than a quarter of last year’s), for which Ms Gardner credits an effective anti-gang unit within the police. When the unit made arrests, these were “strategic <strong>prosecutions</strong> of violent individuals that brought the crime rate down”. The community trusted the officers, says Ms Gardner, because “they weren’t just putting everyone into the system. They would help people. If they needed jobs, they’d get them jobs…They built neighbourhoods of trust.” Political disputes, she said, led to the unit being disbanded.</p><p>When running for office, the city’s new mayor, Tishaura Jones, expressed support for focused deterrence, as well as increasing investments in job-training and mental-health services. She will find eager partners in women such as Ms Miller and Ms Williams, both of whom have started charities to advocate for their causes. But she will also doubtless find that many people share Ms Miller’s view: “I have completely lost faith in St Louis city homicide. They don’t care.” </p>]]></content>

They are a giant risk that is worth taking<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Technological change is upending finance. Bitcoin has gone from being an obsession of <strong>anarchists</strong> to a $1trn asset class that many fund managers insist belongs in any balanced portfolio. Swarms of digital day­-traders have become a force on Wall Street. PayPal has 392m users, a sign that America is catching up with China’s digital­ payments giants. Yet, as our special report explains, the least noticed disruption on the frontier between technology and finance may end up as the most revolutionary: the creation of government digital currencies, which typically aim to let people <strong>deposit</strong> funds directly with a central bank, bypassing conventional lenders.</p><p>These “govcoins” are a new <strong>incarnation</strong> of money. They promise to make finance work better but also to shift power from individuals to the state, alter geopolitics and change how capital is allocated. They are to be treated with optimism, and humility.</p><p>A decade or so ago, amid the <strong>wreckage</strong> of Lehman Brothers,Paul Volcker, a former head of the Federal Reserve, <strong>grumbled</strong> that banking’s last useful innovation was the ATM. Since the crisis, the industry has raised its game. Banks have modernised their creaking it systems. Entrepreneurs have built an experimental world of “decentralised finance”, of which bitcoin is the most famous part and which contains a riot of tokens, databases and <strong>conduits</strong> that interact to varying degrees with traditional finance. Meanwhile, financial “platform” firms now have over 3bn customers who use e-­wallets and payments apps. Alongside PayPal are other specialists such as Ant Group, Grab and Mercado Pago, established firms such as Visa, and Silicon Valley <strong>wannabes</strong> such as Facebook.</p><p>Government or central­-bank digital currencies are the next step but they come with a twist, because they would centralise power in the state rather than spread it through networks or give it to private monopolies. The idea behind them is simple. Instead of holding an account with a retail bank, you would do so direct with a central bank through an interface <strong>resembling</strong> apps such as Alipay or Venmo. Rather than writing cheques or paying online with a card, you could use the central bank’s cheap <strong>plumbing.</strong> And your money would be guaranteed by the full faith of the state, not a fallible bank. Want to buy a pizza or help a broke <strong>sibling</strong>? No need to deal with Citigroup’s call centre or pay Mastercard’s fees: the Bank of England and the Fed are at your service.</p><p>This <strong>metamorphosis</strong> of central banks from the <strong>aristocrats</strong> of finance to its labourers sounds far­fetched, but it is under way. Over 50 monetary authorities, representing the bulk of global GDP, are exploring digital currencies. The Bahamas has issued digital money. China has rolled out its e-­yuan <strong>pilot</strong> to over 500,000 people (see Finance section). The EU wants a virtual euro by 2025, Britain has launched a task­force, and America, the world’s financial <strong>hegemon</strong>, is building a <strong>hypothetical</strong> e-­dollar.</p><p>One motivation for governments and central banks is a fear of losing control. Today central banks harness the banking system to amplify monetary policy. If payments, deposits and loans migrate from banks into privately run digital <strong>realms</strong>, central banks will struggle to manage the economic cycle and inject funds into the system during a crisis. Unsupervised private networks could become a Wild West of fraud and privacy abuses.</p><p>The other motivation is the promise of a better financial system. Ideally money provides a reliable store of value, a stable unit of account and an efficient means of payment. Today’s money gets mixed marks. Uninsured depositors can suffer if banks fail, bitcoin is not widely accepted and credit cards are expensive. Government e-­currencies would score highly, since they are state­-guaranteed and use a cheap, central payments hub. </p><p>As a result, govcoins could cut the operating expenses of the global financial industry, which amount to over $350 a year for every person on Earth. That could make finance accessible for the 1.7bn people who lack bank accounts. Government digital currencies could also expand governments’ toolkits by letting them make instant payments to citizens and cut interest rates below zero. For ordinary users, the appeal of a free, safe, instant, universal means of payment is obvious.</p><p>It is this appeal, though, that creates dangers. Unconstrained, govcoins could fast become a dominant force in finance, particularly if network effects made it hard for people to opt out. They could <strong>destabilise</strong> banks, because if most people and firms <strong>stashed</strong> their cash at the central banks, lenders would have to find other sources of funding with which to back their loans.</p><p>If retail banks were sucked dry of funding, someone else would have to do the lending that fuels business creation. This raises the <strong>queasy</strong> prospect of bureaucrats influencing credit allocation. In a crisis, a digital <strong>stampede</strong> of savers to the central bank could cause bank runs.</p><p>Once <strong>ascendant</strong>, govcoins could become <strong>panopticons</strong> for the state to control citizens: think of instant e-­fines for bad behaviour. They could alter geopolitics, too, by providing a conduit for cross­-border payments and alternatives to the dollar, the world’s reserve currency and a <strong>linchpin</strong> of American influence. The <strong>greenback’s</strong> reign is based partly on America’s open capital markets and property rights, which China cannot rival. But it also relies on old payments systems, <strong>invoicing</strong> conventions and inertia— making it ripe for disruption. Small countries fear that, instead of using local money, people might switch to foreign e­-currencies, causing chaos at home.</p><p>New money, new problems</p><p>Such a vast <strong>spectrum</strong> of opportunities and dangers is <strong>daunting</strong>. It is revealing that China’s autocrats, who value control above all else, are limiting the size of the e-­yuan and <strong>clamping</strong> down on private platforms such as Ant. Open societies should also proceed cautiously by, say, capping digital­-currency accounts. </p><p>Governments and financial firms need to prepare for a long-term shift in how money works, as momentous as the leap to metallic coins or payment cards. That means <strong>beefing up</strong> privacy laws, reforming how central banks are run and preparing retail banks for a more <strong>peripheral</strong> role. State digital currencies are the next great experiment in finance, and they promise to be a lot more <strong>consequential</strong> than the humble ATM.</p><p><a id="permitless-carry-gun-laws-are-misguided-and-should-be-scrapped"></a></p><h1 id="Permitless-carry-gun-laws-are-misguided-and-should-be-scrapped"><a href="#Permitless-carry-gun-laws-are-misguided-and-should-be-scrapped" class="headerlink" title="Permitless-carry gun laws are misguided and should be scrapped"></a>Permitless-carry gun laws are misguided and should be scrapped</h1><p>More states are falling for an extremist take on the Second Amendment<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Every american state requires you to have a licence to drive a car, hunt or become a barber. Yet by the end of this year at least 20 states will allow you to carry a handgun in public without a permit. So far in 2021 five have already passed “permitless carry” laws, and five more, including Texas and Louisiana, are considering them. If these became law, around a third of Americans would live in states where it was legal to carry guns around without any need for a licence or training.</p><p>Anyone who considers the 181 mass shootings that have taken place in America since January, or the recent spike in violent crime, would be forgiven for wondering why some states want fewer restrictions on guns, rather than more. The pro-gun lobby, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), argues that having more armed civilians will help boost public safety, making it more likely that “good guys” with guns can <strong>intercept</strong> “bad guys” with guns. With the help of Republican state legislators, they are advancing an interpretation of the Second Amendment which imagines that America’s founders intended no restrictions on guns or gun ownership whatsoever. Backers of permitless carry call it “constitutional carry” to make it seem legitimate and to appear to give it a <strong>pedigree</strong>.</p><p>Do not be fooled. Permitless carry is a radical departure from tradition and should be opposed. One reason is that the gains to gun owners are <strong>trivial</strong>. In most of the states considering permitless carry, it is already possible to be armed with a handgun concealed in public if you have a licence.</p><p>Obtaining a licence is hardly <strong>onerous</strong>, given what guns are capable of. Applicants are often required to do training and to pass a shooting test. Searches help screen out people who should not be trusted with a gun, such as those who have committed violent crimes or who have a history of mental illness.</p><p>Doing away with these conditions is not in the public interest. Just as communities are made safer by drivers being required to pass tests before they can legally operate a car, so it makes sense for people to learn how to use a <strong>lethal</strong> weapon and impose restrictions on when, where and how they can carry guns around. In most places where permitless carry is being considered, police forces have spoken out against it, because it would make their jobs harder and more dangerous.</p><p>The NRA has spent the past 20 years successfully loosening gun laws. The latest wave of <strong>deregulation</strong> was “<strong>shall issue</strong>” requirements for gun licences, giving officials less discretion about when to withhold them. A study of these laws by researchers at Stanford found that they resulted in a 13-15% increase in violent crime in the decade after they came into force. By the same logic, permitless carry would also probably cost lives.</p><p>Permitless carry is also a misreading of history. Romanticising America as a country that intended no restrictions on guns is incorrect. In the 19th century, most Southern states had stricter gun laws than they do today. Even in Wild West settlements like Tombstone, Arizona, newcomers had to leave their guns on the <strong>outskirts</strong> of town or register them with the sheriff. A century ago the NRA backed permitting laws as a way to promote responsible gun ownership and helped draft the country’s first federal gun-control laws in the 1930s. By arguing for permitless carry, it is not faithfully adhering to the past but drifting further towards an extreme.</p><p>America is the world leader in gun-ownership, with about six times the rate of France and Germany, and more than double <strong>war-torn</strong> Yemen, which comes second. The rate of violent gun-deaths is perhaps 100 times higher than in Britain. Most of America’s peers impose stricter laws—even gun-friendly Switzerland and Canada. Because of the near-permanent deadlock in Congress, the federal government will not pass sensible gun reforms. It is up to the states to take responsibility for the welfare of their citizens. Permitless carry will only do them harm. </p><p><a id="warren-buffett-should-step-aside-for-his-chosen-successor"></a></p><h1 id="Warren-Buffett-should-step-aside-for-his-chosen-successor"><a href="#Warren-Buffett-should-step-aside-for-his-chosen-successor" class="headerlink" title="Warren Buffett should step aside for his chosen successor"></a>Warren Buffett should step aside for his chosen successor</h1><p>Berkshire Hathaway needs a leader who will take a fresh look at performance and governance<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>At 90, warren buffett continues to lead Berkshire Hathaway, wearing the three hats of chief executive, chairman and chief investment officer. For years, the question of whom the <strong>feted</strong> investor would <strong>anoint</strong> as his successor to run the giant conglomerate has been the subject of boardroom gossip. The world now knows the answer, though only because of <strong>a slip of the tongue</strong> by Mr Buffett’s 97-year-old right-hand man, Charlie Munger, at the annual shareholders’ meeting on May 1st. That forced Mr Buffett to confirm that his heir apparent as chief executive is Greg Abel, 58, a trusted <strong>lieutenant</strong> who runs Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses.</p><p>The <strong>cack-handed</strong> way in which the succession plan became public fits a bigger pattern. Berkshire is a huge public company, with a stockmarket value of $645bn and an army of devoted retail investors. It is, though, structured and run in much the way it was when Mr Buffett took it over in the 1960s. He has never hidden his reluctance to retire. He once joked that he’ll step down five years after he dies. However, Berkshire needs to make changes if it is to keep up with the times—and that includes having a new person at the top.</p><p>That is not to denigrate Mr Buffett or his achievements. In his 56 years in charge, Berkshire’s total returns have been double those of the s&amp;p 500 index. He can claim to be the greatest value-investor who ever lived. He has <strong>instilled</strong> an admirable trust-based culture at Berkshire. The dozens of <strong>fawning</strong> books he has inspired constitute their own genre of business publishing.</p><p>However, cracks have started to appear. One is Berkshire’s financial performance, which has been mediocre over the past decade. Mr Buffett has made some costly mistakes, such as bad bets on airlines and Kraft Heinz, a consumer-goods giant. He has admitted to overpaying for <strong>acquisitions</strong>, including a big metal-parts-maker that later wrote off $11bn. Were it not for a valuable stake in Apple, the bottom line would have looked <strong>limper</strong> still. Suspicion is growing that Mr Buffett has lost his magic touch in allocating capital, perhaps because, like other star fund managers, he is too big to <strong>outperform</strong> the market by much.</p><p>Berkshire’s governance needs rethinking, too. For all the autonomy its divisions enjoy, Mr Buffett still has to sign off on the big decisions. He has special shares with greatly enhanced voting power. The board is <strong>stacked</strong> with Friends of Warren; five of its 14 members are 89 or over. Berkshire’s failure to write or disclose its policies on investor priorities such as climate risk and diversity irks some shareholders, including big institutions like BlackRock. When investors called Buffett-style governance “unique” they used to mean it as a compliment. No longer.</p><p>The company’s <strong>lousy</strong> disclosure looks out of step with the times, too. Berkshire offers little beyond <strong>mandatory</strong> <strong>filings</strong> and the occasional press release. It does not hold analyst meetings or investor days; it does not even have a functioning investor-relations department. The closest thing to outside scrutiny it tolerates is the three hours of friendly shareholders’ questions, <strong>teed up</strong> by a <strong>genial</strong> reporter from CNBC, at the annual <strong>conclave</strong>.</p><p>The company needs to start dealing with these deficiencies now, or face the increased risk of a drama—such as an attempt by activist investors to break up Berkshire, or a regulatory <strong>rumble</strong>—when Mr Buffett does eventually leave. There is no need to stoop to the <strong>box-ticking</strong> corporate conformity that he so <strong>loathes</strong>, an <strong>aversion</strong> reflected in his public criticism of the metrics and questionnaires <strong>wielded</strong> by ESG campaigners.</p><p>Get the job done, Warren<br>New blood and greater openness would be a good start. Naming a successor is a first step. The next should be to <strong>replenish</strong> the board with outside appointments. Investors must get the information they need to make informed decisions, including analysis of where the firm is creating value, and the tax and other <strong>synergies</strong> that justify keeping the <strong>conglomerate</strong> intact.</p><p>The biggest question of all is when Mr Buffett should go. He may want to die at his desk, but the longer he stays, the more he risks becoming a <strong>liability</strong>. He said at this year’s AGM that bad leaders are the biggest risk companies face. Good leaders who stay too long are not far behind. Mr Buffett has had a wonderful run. But now that the succession is out in the open, it is time to move aside and let Mr Abel fix what isn’t working. </p><p><a id="somaliland-deserves-international-recognition"></a></p><h1 id="Somaliland-deserves-international-recognition"><a href="#Somaliland-deserves-international-recognition" class="headerlink" title="Somaliland deserves international recognition"></a>Somaliland deserves international recognition</h1><p>It is far more functional than Somalia, the state to which it notionally belongs<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>Somaliland’s first stab at independence lasted less than a week. Pipers of the Royal Highland <strong>Fusiliers</strong> were ordered to play the new state’s national <strong>anthem</strong> at a ceremony in Hargeisa, the capital, marking the end of British colonial rule in June 1960. On discovering that it did not have one, the <strong>bandmaster</strong> <strong>cobbled</strong> together a <strong>medley</strong> of local folk tunes, and conducted it with <strong>brio</strong>. A day later, however, Somaliland’s parliament passed an act of union with Somalia, a former Italian colony to its south, and Somaliland officially was no more.</p><p>It was a <strong>catastrophic</strong> mistake. Within a decade the new Somali Republic had collapsed. Its president was assassinated by his bodyguards. A Marxist <strong>junta</strong> seized power, led by Siad Barre, a general-turned-dictator. He abolished democracy and wrecked the economy by <strong>nationalising</strong> nearly everything except camel herds. He also launched a <strong>disastrous</strong> war against Ethiopia. When the northerners rebelled, he bombed Hargeisa, killing thousands of civilians. As Somalia <strong>disintegrated</strong> into <strong>clan</strong> warfare, Barre refused to negotiate, saying: “When I leave Somalia, I will leave behind buildings but no people.” He was not far off the mark. By the time he fled, in 1991, the country had plunged into chaos from which it has yet to emerge.</p><p>Somaliland unsurprisingly wanted out. Its elders agreed to break away from the rest of Somalia in 1991 at a “Grand Shir”, or gathering of clans, held in a small town in the desert. Since then, Somaliland has become a functioning state <strong>in all but name</strong>, with 4.5m people on an area bigger than Florida. It has been largely peaceful. It controls its borders and its territory, unlike Somalia’s government, which controls little more than its capital city, and that only thanks to 20,000 foreign peacekeepers. <strong>Whereas</strong> Somalia has not held a direct election since the 1960s, Somaliland periodically votes for its president and lawmakers, even if polls are <strong>marred</strong> by attacks on the press and take place less often than they should.</p><p>Yet in the eyes of the world Somaliland remains part of Somalia. For longer than most of its people have been alive, its pleas for recognition as an independent state have been ignored. The world defers on this to the African Union, the <strong>continental</strong> <strong>arbiter</strong>. It, in turn, argues that Somaliland can win independence only with the consent of Somalia, which says no.</p><p>The obvious objection to recognising Somaliland is that redrawing maps is <strong>perilous</strong>. This is especially so in Africa, where borders thoughtlessly imposed in colonial times separate countless clans and ethnic groups from their kin. <strong>Untangling</strong> this mess would be so tricky that a consensus long ago emerged: leave the map as it is.</p><p>Once you start moving borders or creating new states for this or that group, others will demand their own homelands, too, and blood will surely flow. Witness Africa’s two newest breakaway countries, Eritrea and South Sudan, which have become a <strong>gulag</strong> state and a war zone. Were Somaliland to win independence, people in other bits of Somalia might try to break away, too, as would ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the regional power.</p><p>For all these reasons, Somaliland’s case will not prevail soon. Yet it deserves a hearing. It is not seeking to redraw borders from <strong>scratch</strong>, but to <strong>revert</strong> to old ones. Some 97% of its people supported independence in a <strong>referendum</strong> in 2001. Scottish and Catalan nationalists can only dream of such <strong>unanimity</strong>. Most Somalilanders have known nothing but self-rule and would never consent to <strong>reintegrate</strong> with their bloody, anarchic suzerain.</p><p>Meanwhile, denying them recognition imposes severe human costs. Somalilanders cannot travel freely, since few countries accept Somaliland passports. They are poorer than they should be, since their government does not have the status to make trade deals or borrow directly from the World Bank or the IMF. Statehood would help fix some of these problems.</p><p>Ideally, Somaliland’s separation should be achieved with the agreement of Somalia. For the time being this seems far-fetched. But Somalia should be encouraged to grant a divorce with promises of aid and debt relief from the donors who already <strong>bankroll</strong> its government and pay for the peacekeepers who <strong>prop it up</strong>. If, like an abusive spouse, Somalia refuses to let go, Somaliland should not be held hostage. Other countries should recognise it, and international organisations should treat it like a state.</p><p>Were Somaliland to win formal independence again, its road ahead would be hard. But the odds of flourishing would be much better this time. It now has not only a <strong>breezy</strong> national anthem but also a 30-year record of reasonably successful self-rule. To recognise that is to recognise reality.</p><p><a id="how-to-make-long-term-climate-pledges-add-up"></a></p><h1 id="How-to-make-long-term-climate-pledges-add-up"><a href="#How-to-make-long-term-climate-pledges-add-up" class="headerlink" title="How to make long-term climate pledges add up"></a>How to make long-term climate pledges add up</h1><p>A German court shines a light on the <strong>murk</strong> of emissions targets<br>来源：2021-05-08 TheEconomist UKedition</p><p>The climate law that the German government passed in 2019 required a cut in greenhouse-gas emissions of 55%, from levels in 1990, by 2030. Climate activists saw this as insufficient. They took the government to court on the basis that, by not treating climate action seriously enough, it was denying basic rights to citizens of the future.</p><p>The court has now rejected the more ambitious aspects of that complaint. But its ruling at the end of last month did nevertheless find fault with the law. Although the target for 2030 was not in itself deemed to be inadequate, the court decided that it does pose a problem in the context of the law’s longer-term aspiration to “net zero” emissions in 2050. The combination of the two pledges seemed to allow governments to impose a greater share of the total burden of decarbonisation on the future. The burden is all the heavier when you consider that the low-hanging apples are usually the first to be picked.</p><p>For justice to be done, the court ruled, there must be intermediate targets. It asked for details of them by the end of 2022. The immediate response, across all parties, was to talk of increasing ambition both in the near term and the longer term: a 65% cut by 2030, net zero by 2045.</p><p>To achieve that would <strong>presumably</strong> require a quick end to the internal-<strong>combustion</strong> engine, long a <strong>wellspring</strong> of national engineering pride—and exports. Germany’s coal phase-out would have to accelerate. And massive infrastructure development would be needed to support <strong>the Achilles heel</strong> of the country’s renewable-energy infrastructure: its vulnerability to kalte Dunkelflaute, the cold, dark <strong>doldrums</strong> in which sun and wind abandon the land but the hearth must stay warm.</p><p>Germans—rich, green and technically adept—may find ways to accomplish all this. Or they may not. Over the past decade they have been quite happy to close down their fleet of emissions-sparing nuclear power plants. It would be odd if a long-standing aversion to nuclear power should prove to be the only political objective the country turns out to put ahead of its commitment to climate action.</p><p>However, the court’s reservation also applies well beyond Germany. A near-term goal, expressed as a reduction in emissions with respect to some historical baseline, and a longer-term goal expressed as a date at which they intend to reach net-zero emissions, is increasingly the norm for countries seeking to take the climate seriously. These net-zero goals do not commit a country to a specific level of emissions, but to developing “negative emissions” on a scale that will cover whatever it does end up emitting. This makes what is actually being called for in terms of reduction between 2030 and 2050, or in some cases 2060, impossible to assess. It thus makes the <strong>fairness</strong> of requiring that effort from future generations impossible to judge.</p><p>This is a gateway to endless fudge. Notional negative emissions are based on forestry, new agricultural practices, rewilding and various technologies that suck carbon from the atmosphere and store it underground. Because they can be invoked to make up any <strong>shortfall</strong> in emission cuts, some activists are <strong>sceptical</strong> of including them in targets.</p><p><strong>Blanket doubt</strong> is unreasonable. Net-zero thinking makes geophysical and economic sense. Some emissions will surely prove so hard to <strong>abate</strong> that it will be cheaper to develop technologies to suck an equivalent amount of warming potential out of the air. And if that balance can be achieved globally, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will <strong>stabilise</strong> and the warming stop. That is why the Paris agreement of 2015 treats net-zero as a second-half-of-the-century goal.</p><p>But net-zero thinking is troublesome, even so. It allows the <strong>ultimate</strong> scope of emission cuts to remain undefined and sweeps all the uncertainties under a carpet of techno-optimism. To keep governments honest, voters and activists around the world need to echo the German court’s order.</p><p>They should insist that governments show how they will create negative emissions in just and <strong>robust</strong> ways—so, no afforestation on poor people’s land simply because you can and no double counting or leaky carbon reservoirs. (不要仅仅因为你能做到，就在穷人的土地上植树造林，也不要重复计算或泄漏碳储库。)And they must insist on good-faith estimates of the negative emissions governments are <strong>banking on</strong>. That way they can tell if they are feasible and see what cuts will be needed in five, ten or 15 years’ time.</p>]]></content>

And so, having reached the very bottom of the barrel marked “Marcel Proust,” the scraping continues, even unto the splintered wood. The usual run of a famous author’s remains is more or less set: first the (disillusioning) biography, then the (surprisingly mundane, money-mad) letters, and finally the (painfully naked) diaries, in which erotic obsessions that seem curious and fresh in literary prose look mechanically obsessive in daily record, as with Kenneth Tynan and John Cheever. What comes after is mostly academic commentary.</p><p>But with the biography, the letters, and the journals long in the rearview mirror, the popular secondary works on Proust continue to appear in manic numbers. Anything Proustian, it seems, gets published now. Not long ago, we were given a book made up solely of his desperately polite, querulous letters to his upstairs neighbors in one of his last apartment buildings, on the Boulevard Haussmann, complaining about the noise—and sounding exactly like a classic S. J. Perelman casual. In the past fifteen years or so, certainly since the dawn of the new century, the huge success of Alain de Botton’s “How Proust Can Change Your Life” has been followed by a candid book on Proust’s sex life (by his American biographer, William C. Carter); the memoirs of his Swedish valet (also edited by Carter); a study, by the Auden biographer Richard Davenport-Hines, of Proust’s final days, at the Ritz and the Majestic; Benjamin Taylor’s study of Proust’s life as a distinctly Jewish one; the first fully annotated versions of “Swann’s Way” (both by Carter and by Lydia Davis); Clive James’s long verse commentary “Gate of Lilacs”; and a graphic-novel version of “Swann’s Way,” not to mention an album by the talented Russian-French sisters called the Milstein Duo, “The Vinteuil Sonata,” devoted to the real-life candidates for the musical phrase that entangled Swann’s heart and doomed his life. That’s doubtless not even half the harvest. The books are often illustrated with the intensity of religious tracts. In one, we are given a detailed diagram of the apartment with the cork-lined room where Proust spent his reclusive late years. (The room’s original interior can be found at the Musée Carnavalet, the museum of the history of Paris.) “Lost” works appear. Just last month, Gallimard, in Paris, published “Les Soixante-quinze Feuillets,” an early, more directly autobiographical overture, long thought to have vanished, of themes that he would later develop in depth. And now, in English, arrives a fearsomely slender book, “The Mysterious Correspondent,” nine stories, mostly fragmentary, mostly unpublished, that have only recently been rediscovered, appearing as something between juvenilia and a sketchbook.</p><p>All this work attests to the reputation of the most often attempted, most rarely summited, of all mountainous modern books, Proust’s multivolume “À la Recherche du Temps Perdu,” which, first Englished as “Remembrance of Things Past,” is now routinely more severely Frenchified as “In Search of Lost Time.” (That there are passionate debates about the varying merits of his translators and of these titles is part of the general Proustian effect.) Why some writers get this kind of attention—rooted in encompassing appetite rather than in mere admiration—and some do not is hard to know and interesting to contemplate. Chekhov, born a decade earlier, is a writer of similar stature, and his plays are genuinely popular. But only specialists debate his translators, and there are no books delving into the originals of his characters, or providing recipes for Chekhovian blini, or explaining how Chekhov can change your life, or presenting photographs of his intimates. Proust, by contrast, is a sort of improbable Belle Époque Tolkien, the maker of a world with passports and maps and secret codes, to which many seek entry.</p><p>A writer’s ability to induce this kind of fanaticism—less cult status than cathedral status, where we expect long lines, and hope to be improved by our visit—is still mysterious. Proust, even after he published the first volume of his great work, in 1913, would not have seemed a natural for such a role. He is, after all, the writer who put the long in “longueur”—whose subject is not war and peace, or the making and breaking of a dynasty, or, as with Joyce, the history of literature implanted in an urban day. His terrain is, rather, the strangled loves and pains of a small, fashionable circle, with much of the novel spent with the narrator going back and forth to beach resorts and feeling things, and many more pages, particularly in the middle books, where he simply takes trains, feels jealous, then feels less jealous, then more.</p><p>The peripheral Proust may persist as part of our search for a skeleton key to all the others—a way inside. There are at least six Marcel Prousts to study, and, though we’d like to say that each feeds the others, the truth is that they exist in separate, sometimes baffling strata. There’s the Period Proust, the Toulouse-Lautrec-like painter of the high life of the Belle Époque, who offers an unmatched picture both of riding in the Bois and of visiting the brothels near the Opéra; and the Philosophical Proust, whose thoughts on the nature of time supposedly derived from the ideas of Henri Bergson and are argued to have paralleled those of Einstein. There’s the Psychological Proust, whose analysis of human motives—above all, of love and jealousy—is the real living core of his book; and the “Perverse” Proust (as the eminent scholar Antoine Compagnon refers to him), who was among the first French authors to write quite openly about homosexuality. Then there is the Political Proust, the Jewish writer who diagrammed the fault line that the Dreyfus Affair first cracked in French society, and that the war pulled apart. Finally, there’s the Poetic Proust, the pathétique Proust who writes the sentences and finds the phrases, and whose twilight intensity and violet-tinted charm make his Big Book one of the few that readers urge on friends rather than merely force on students.</p><p>For all the speculative profundity that can be discovered in the vast annotative literature surrounding Proust, ranging from Samuel Beckett’s bleak, inscrutable summary to Roland Barthes’s structural appreciation, Proust is least interesting for his philosophical depth. The profound bits in Proust are the most commonplace, while the commonplace bits—the descriptions, the evocation of place, the characterizations, the jokes, the observations, and, most of all, the love stories—are the most profound. His is the most militant tract of aestheticism ever attempted, and understanding why it has been the most successful at making converts is the key to all the other nested Prousts.</p><p>The son of a half-Jewish Parisian grand-bourgeois family, Proust was known, before the 1913 publication of “Swann’s Way,” as a malicious, amusing, slightly absurd society boy, with a vaguely pathetic literary hobby. He had written some standard-issue aesthetic essays and stories, which no one read, and had translated Ruskin’s study of the Amiens cathedral. (He was an inveterate Anglophile: his favorite novelist was George Eliot, and his favorite novel “The Mill on the Floss.”) A charming society hanger-on, he was admired by his close friends for his literary dedication and the extraordinary flow of his letters—which are effortlessly parenthetical, sliding into digression and back to the main point with the skill of a rally driver dipping in and out of traffic at a hundred miles an hour. None of them, however, thought him much more than a dilettante.</p><p>The newly published stories collected in “The Mysterious Correspondent” feel wispy and inconsequential, but are fascinating as clues to Proust’s limitations, which, before 1913, seemed far more formidable than his talents. The stories were written in the eighteen-nineties, when he was in his twenties, and then locked away in a drawer while he worked on his unpublished novel, “Jean Santeuil,” and then on his masterwork. The title story, at least, was hidden for an obvious reason: it’s a tale of lesbian love. A timid, wealthy woman discovers that the thrilling love note she has received—which sets off a fantasy of making love to a soldier, complete with sword and spurs—was actually written by her closest woman friend. Proust often used lesbian love as a way into writing about homoerotic desire, partly because the female kind was, if not socially acceptable, at least a standard source of aesthetic frisson, and partly because it gave him an acceptable distance from which to write about his own same-sex desires.</p><p>It’s striking how out of focus the stories seem: they have a trancelike rhythm that makes events uneventful, and an absence of narrative push. Reading these lost tales, one recalls that, although none of Proust’s contemporaries doubted his intelligence, they did doubt his ability to turn his literary bent into something solid. In these stories, one sees what worried them: there’s every sign of a natural writer, but no sign at all of an author.</p><p>When the first volume of “In Search of Lost Time” appeared, a year before the Great War, the shock of its excellence was captured in a delicious exchange with André Gide, the magus of the Parisian literary scene. Apologizing for having passed on “Swann’s Way” for his Nouvelle Revue Française, Gide offered an explanation almost more insulting than the original rejection: “For me you were still the man who frequented the houses of Mmes X. and Z., the man who wrote for the Figaro. I thought of you, shall I confess it, as ‘du côté de chez Verdurin’; a snob, a man of the world, and a dilettante—the worst possible thing for our review.” Proust, who had money, had offered to help subsidize the publication, which, Gide fumbles to explain, only made it seem a dubious effort at buying a reputation. (That year, Gide confided in his journal his doubts that any Jewish writer could truly master the “virtues” of the French tradition.)</p><p>Proust responded with the most beautiful fuck-you letter in literary history, suavely pretending that Gide’s belatedly flattering letter made up for all the previous insults: “Had there been no rejection, no repeated rejections by the N.R.F., I should never have had your letter. . . . The joy of receiving your letter infinitely surpasses any I should have had at being published by the N.R.F. . . . How I should like to be able to give someone I loved as much pleasure as you have given me.” Gide, no fool, made a firm offer to publish the rest of the novel, which the Nouvelle Revue did, right through to its completion.</p><p>The exchange underlines several aspects of Proust as a phenomenon. First, Proust landed on his contemporaries with something of the same revelatory shock that he delivers to us. Perhaps only the abrupt celebrity of Karl Ove Knausgaard has had the same effect in our time. What made the metamorphosis? The unimaginably large space between the Proust of “The Mysterious Correspondent” and the Proust of “Swann’s Way” lies in his learning to trust the meandering nature of his own intelligence. He found a voice by hearing his own. The one thing that Proust’s mature literary manner is not is mannered. It was as natural and unimpeded as Mark Twain’s. His mind moved exactly as his sentences do, and his gift was to be able to trace its movements without being halted by other people’s literary rules.</p><p>But the exchange with Gide also reminds us of a less high-minded truth: that Proust was part of the beau monde of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and that his enthusiasm for the high life—call it snobbery, as Gide did—was unmistakable. Part of the appeal of the novel is the era’s glamour. Swann goes to recover from his jealousies at the still extant swank restaurant Lapérouse; when the narrator realizes that “houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years,” it is the high season in the Bois de Boulogne, the most exactingly landscaped park in Paris. Proust had conventional Parisian haute-bourgeois tastes of the time, from dinner in the Ritz garden to sexual frolics in the Right Bank brothels. He wanted the Prix Goncourt (got it), the Légion d’Honneur (got it), and membership in the Académie Française (couldn’t get it). Along with everything else he did that was more academically respectable, he offered a picture of a particularly beautiful place and period in the world’s history.</p><p>Proust front-loads his novel with his philosophy of time. One of the oddities is that its most famous incident happens within the first dozen pages, and is, nonetheless, isolated from the rest: the narrator (Proustians haughtily resist identifying him with Proust himself, or referring to him as Marcel, though he obviously is) eats the crumbs of a madeleine dipped in lime-blossom tea and is suddenly thrust back to his childhood at Combray. (The town was based on Illiers, an hour outside Paris, though in later volumes Proust quietly moved Combray much farther north and east, so that it could participate in the battles of the Great War.) His premise is that everything remains inside ourselves, including the past, not just in schematic outline but in its full sensory elaboration. The little smells and sounds are in there along with the big traumas and events. But, as readers may not recall, the memory event isn’t the unbidden association of a sensory clue with a suddenly materializing memory. On the contrary, the event is the result of an effortful process often met with failure:</p><blockquote><p>Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being? I cannot tell. Now I feel nothing; it has stopped, has perhaps sunk back into its darkness, from which who can say whether it will ever rise again? Ten times over I must essay the task, must lean down over the abyss. And each time the cowardice that deters us from every difficult task, every important enterprise, has urged me to leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely of the worries of today and my hopes for tomorrow, which can be brooded over painlessly.</p></blockquote><p>Proust’s celebrated account of time’s relativity, dancing above or outside experience, though persuasively detailed, is not terribly original. It’s little different from the one that Shakespeare had long before put in Rosalind’s mouth: “Time travels in divers paces with divers persons.” Its apparent likeness to Einstein’s theory of special relativity has been much promoted, recently by the French physicist Thibault Damour, in his book “Once Upon Einstein.” Proust does seem to have become politely aware of Einstein, though rather as a contemporary writer might be of string theory—as a popular metaphor or two drawn from various newspaper writeups. But the similarities are strictly limited. Einstein’s insight was not that “everything is relative” but the opposite: his paradoxes of time are really paradoxes of timekeeping, and are the consequence of his introduction of an absolute, fixed standard—the speed of light. A revival of Sol Invictus worship was as reasonable an aftershock of Einstein’s theories as ideational relativism. In any case, a great novel could be written that intimates and parallels Einstein, and a bad one could be written that intimates and parallels Einstein. Proust’s book makes its own light.</p><p>The Philosophical Proust’s view of time is tied to his larger view of the primacy of mind—in which what we imagine matters more than what we see—and it is this view that shades over, more profitably, into the Psychological Proust. We think that we are living in the world, he insists, when we are living only in our minds. Again, the first volume sets the template, oft repeated later. Charles Swann—the Jewish man-about-town, welcome in every living room high, low, and middle—thinks that he is desperately in love with the courtesan Odette de Crécy; his eventual marriage to Odette gives him the beautiful child Gilberte, the first volume’s heroine, but it diminishes his life. The narrator’s cool analysis of motive (informed by Swann’s retrospective regrets) reveals that Swann has merely projected his obsessions onto Odette. He is in love with the face of one of the Botticelli women on the walls of the Sistine Chapel; he is in love with the fragment of music from the Vinteuil Sonata (probably a melody of Saint-Saëns’s) that he associates with her. He is triangulated by his own intensities.</p><p>Above all, he is in love with his own love, with things made in his own mind, and when ardor cools he is dazed to discover that the great passion of his life had been for a woman he didn’t like at all, a woman “who was not my type.” This, much more than the madeleine memory, is the real Proustian turn. Jealousy, the key emotion in Proust, is self-generated; we go hunting for rumors or images of our beloved entangled with another, to refresh the pain that has become synonymous with love. Our emotions move us right through a sequence of feelings, from the lightest to the darkest and back again, giving the illusion of walking in the park when we are merely once again touring the attic.</p><p>The narrator’s objects of desire and jealousy, like Swann’s, are all women, and it has long been accepted that they are almost all modelled on men. What Proust memorialized as living “in the shadow of young girls in flower” was more like luxuriating in the shadow of young boys on the make. As Carter’s “Proust in Love” details, the novelist, like most wealthy gay men of his time, found lovers extensively among working-class youths: waiters at the Ritz and chauffeurs at resorts. Not exclusively so—Gilberte, the narrator’s first great love as a boy, was modelled on several girls he knew—but Carter shows that Albertine, who dominates the middle volumes, is certainly a transmuted, if composited, version of Proust’s beloved chauffeur, Alfred Agostinelli.</p><p>Proust suffered from a set of gay fact checkers, in the person of other French writers—Jean Cocteau and Gide among them—who scoffed regularly at the transparency of his disguises, pointing out that the narrator’s blithe claim to have made love to fourteen or so girls on the beach was absurd, given the realities of young women’s lives in the period, though it was entirely plausible with working-class boys. (And his intimates <em>were</em> often boys—sixteen and seventeen. We are vastly more tolerant of sexual difference today, but we police age differences far more aggressively.)</p><p>Yet there is nothing humanly unconvincing about Albertine as an invented woman, or about the ring of girls on the beach as girls. That’s partly because Proust, utterly specific about the intricacies of the psyche, is cleverly unspecific about physical types: there are hardly any curvaceous bosoms or rounded bottoms, as in Zola, just an undifferentiated paradise of pure sensation. On the beach, vitality and exuberance are Proust’s hallmarks of attraction: “fine bodies, fine legs, fine hips, wholesome, serene faces,” as he catalogues them. “Blooming cheeks” occur over and over in Proust as a desirable attribute, with a Nabokovian pun in French as in English.</p><p>The anthropology of “sexual inversion” dominates the later volumes, particularly “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sodom-Gomorrah-Search-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039318">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>,” with its overheard hip flirt of attraction in the courtyard between the former tailor Jupien and the baron Charlus. Proust’s view of gayness would, by contemporary standards, be considered homophobic: he treats gay men, whom he calls “men-women,” as suffering from a deforming syndrome. Yet, whatever defensive tap dancing past the police is at work here (and Proust was arrested at least once in a male brothel), the portrait of male homosexuality is meant to be intricately humane. The idea of the man-woman is not a derogation of homosexuality but an explanation of its normalcy: people, being people, contain opposites within themselves. Against the old Platonic idea that humans are longing for their missing half, the “Perverse” Proust’s point is that they possess it already. Homosexuality is neither a deliciously archaic transgression, as it was for Wilde’s circle in London, nor a damnable perversion. It just is. We are all double in ourselves, he insisted—a formulation that he took from Montaigne, who he knew was part Jewish and who he may have thought was homosexual.</p><p>There is, however, a tear within the Matrix. As the strangled new stories in “The Mysterious Correspondent” remind us, Proust is often strange on the subject of lesbianism. In the becalmed Albertine volumes—which Proust, as Compagnon reminds us, enlarged late in the game—Proust’s anxiety about Albertine’s possible lesbian loves is, as Carter suggests, an extension of Proust’s anxiety about Agostinelli’s affairs with women. The disdain that Proust shows for lesbian lovers seems the one unresolved spot in his transpositions of desires. His lesbians are actually straight women who might seduce his own male lover, represented as a girl. Proust himself has a hard time keeping all the reflections in focus in this house of mirrors.</p><p>Even Proust’s dabbling in sexual paraphilia is touched by his peculiarly expansive kind of holistic humanism. He is reported, with what truth it is hard to say, to have had a taste for sadistic sexual rituals—in one particularly grotesque account, bringing himself to climax by watching rats forced to fight with one another in his presence. Yet in the pages of his book the dramatized relationship between cruelty and tenderness is so constant that it is no surprise that one might become a mirror image of the other. In Proust, fetishized desires are not seen as intrusions into an otherwise healthy persona but as naturally paired within one. It is entirely Proustian to imagine that the more kindness the more kink, the more appetite for delicacy the more desire for humiliation or fetishized savagery. In the last volume of the novel, Proust has his hyper-refined Baron de Charlus, after paying to be beaten in a brothel, protest that his punisher was not of sufficiently humble origins—not an authentic brute but only a pretend one. The joke isn’t that Charlus is ridiculous in wanting to be beaten by a real villain; the absurdity lies only in how quixotic he becomes in the pursuit of that desire.</p><p>For Proust, there was no hypocrisy in the exquisite aesthete who wants to be roughed up or even in that of the family man who achieves climax by cursing his family (a specific case known to him). Indeed, if one wanted a scientific coördinate for Proust’s vision, one might find it not in Einstein but in James Clerk Maxwell’s theories of electromagnetism, with one sensual field perpetually flipping into its opposite by a fixed law of oscillation. The truth of the battery is, for Proust, the truth of humankind; it must have two poles or it can carry no charge.</p><p>Today, the most present of Prousts is, inevitably, a Political Proust. Proust, being both gay and Jewish, participated in the two dissident cultures that are at the heart of so much modernist art. Benjamin Taylor’s book, in the Yale “Jewish Lives” series, does the best job of narrating Proust’s self-discovery as a Jew, as double-sided as his other understandings, and particularly his surprisingly aggressive role supporting the wrongly prosecuted Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Proust, who, though the son of a Jewish woman, was raised in the Catholic Church, was astonishingly courageous during the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/28/trial-of-the-century">Dreyfus Affair</a>. He had no personal incentive to take such an outspoken stand, and he could win no points with the leftist opposition, since he was regarded as a comically marginal figure by the people he admired. (His signature on one Dreyfus petition, proudly offered, wasn’t at first even reprinted in the papers.)</p><p>Taylor insists that this was a genuine act of pure principle. Proust recognized the injustice and found it intolerable. There were assimilated Jews—Theodor Herzl, most famously—who became “single identity” Jews during the Dreyfus Affair. Proust was not one of them. But the word “intellectual,” in our current sense, was invented then, for the Dreyfusards, and that was what he became. He began to think of himself as a republican intellectual, a citizen with a pen and a conscience, as much as the aesthete he had been.</p><p>Though the Great War crushed Proust’s Paris, the Dreyfus Affair is the central exterior act of “In Search of Lost Time.” Just as Swann realizes that the Odette for whom he sacrificed his life is an imaginary creature, so the narrator realizes that the aristocrats of the Faubourg Saint-Germain are his own imaginative projection. The magic that had clung even to the name Guermantes proves to be as illusory as Odette’s Botticelli aura. The Duke de Guermantes’s anti-Semitic rant against the Dreyfusards is not just vile but vulgar, the kind of thing you would expect to read in a cheap tabloid. Proust had always expected his aristocrats to think stupidly; he just didn’t expect so many to behave so shabbily. The result was a revelation like Swann’s: it turns out that they had never really been his type.</p><p>Yet all other Prousts turn back, finally, to the Poetic Proust. We hear him clearly on the Milstein album; in the Saint-Saëns melody, we recognize at once the world Proust has conjured, its violet pangs and waves of emotion. As he wrote in a letter, “The essential purpose of music is to awaken in us the mysterious depths of our soul (which literature, painting, and sculpture cannot express).” The most musical pages of writing that exist in any language are those in the section of “Swann’s Way” called “Place-Names: The Name,” devoted to the romance of the adolescent Marcel and Gilberte, the daughter of Swann and Odette. Coming after the romance of the adults, it recapitulates all of its themes, though in a tenderly comic register:</p><blockquote><p>Doubtless the various reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man. As life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in the cultivation of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with the pleasure we derive from thinking of a woman, as I thought of Gilberte, without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality. . . . But at the period when I was in love with Gilberte, I still believed that Love did really exist outside ourselves.</p></blockquote><p>The book dispels this illusion of love, only after having first realized it perfectly here. The adolescent romance is, to be sure, very French—the two are young enough to play children’s games in the Champs-Élysées each afternoon, yet old enough to engage in a memorable moment of frottage. But what one recalls from “Place-Names: The Name” is the Mozartian sound through which the miniature love affair of the two children perfectly transposes—as when music we have first heard on flute and piano comes to us freshly revoiced, on an original-instrument recording, by recorder and harpsichord—the adult affair of Odette and Swann. It is a tonal triumph.</p><p>Proust has been called a novelist of manners, meaning a student of mores, of social rituals, but he is also a novelist of manners in another sense, a writer to whom courtesy is of exceptionally, almost supremely, high value. He admired the French aristocrats’ gift for making awkward moments easier—he even inserts into the book abstract details of good manners, like the Princess de Parme’s admiring the narrator’s “American” rubbers, meant for bad weather, which her footmen disdain. (“With those on, you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go,” the Princess says. “You’re independent of the weather.”)</p><p>This pattern of French manners, so different from the British upper-class habit of creating maximum awkwardness to display status, is not cosmeticized. The Duchess de Guermantes will soon blow past Swann’s confession that he is dying with her dismissive reply: “You must be joking. . . . Come and have lunch.” But manners matter, still. The most telling of the peripheral Prousts newly on hand might be found in that strange volume of letters to his upstairs neighbors (translated by Davis), where he filters his ornery neurasthenia through the sieve of good manners, constantly sending gifts and praise along with his complaints. “Madame: I had ordered these flowers for you and I am in despair that they are coming on a day when against all expectation I feel so ill that I would like to ask you for silence tomorrow Saturday,” he writes. “Yet as this request is in no way conjoined with the flowers, causing them to lose all their fragrance as disinterested mark of respect and to bristle with nasty thorns, I would like even more not to ask you for this silence.”</p><p>One finds Proust here in pure, and necessarily comic, form. Courtesy is comedy: its elaborate euphemisms work like the slamming doors in a Feydeau farce, italicizing the elaborate network of ways in which we <em>just</em> avoid hurting one another’s feelings. For Proust, manners make humankind tolerable, as the one way to escape our own inevitable egotisms. We fall in love with ourselves, and the only way out is not through others—the standard ethical insistence—but through art, which connects us with others in a kind of psychic network of solipsisms. Part of Proust’s humanism lies in his ability to locate the world exclusively between our ears, without supposing that its residence there is necessarily to be regretted.</p><p>Proust’s still peerless original translator, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, has been mocked, by Nabokov, among others, for making Proust’s titles falsely Shakespearean: “Remembrance of Things Past” instead of the direct “In Search of Lost Time.” And yet this was a felicitous accident of taste, since there is something genuinely Shakespearean in Proust’s ability to extend his sympathy to every corner of his invention, even to people he finds ridiculous (like the Verdurins) or corrupted (like Charlus). They, too, have their story. Perhaps it is the wholeness of his humanism that explains why—despite the novel’s often bleak and disillusioned import—the happiest hours of many readers’ lives, including this one, have been spent reading him. “What a lot of pain there was all the way through,” an Iris Murdoch character muses about Proust. “So how was it that the whole thing could vibrate with such a pure joy?” John Updike, too, coming to Proust at a time of his own Christian doubts, found in him the necessary remedy, the only credible modern religious novelist. There is happiness to be found in his fatalism.</p><p>If Proust, for Updike in the God-haunted nineteen-fifties, was the last Christian poet, we may see him now in more secular terms, as a writer who, perversely, sought serenity not in detachment and self-removal but in attachment and reattachment—a monk within a metropolitan monastery. “Be here now” is the mystic’s insistence. “<em>Don’t</em> be here now” is Proust’s material motto: be there then, again. Enjoy, emote, repeat, remember: there are worse designs for living. </p><p><a id="how-long-can-we-live"></a></p><h1 id="How-Long-Can-We-Live"><a href="#How-Long-Can-We-Live" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can We Live?"></a>How Long Can We Live?</h1><p>来源: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/magazine/human-lifespan.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/magazine/human-lifespan.html</a></p><p>In 1990, not long after Jean-Marie Robine and Michel Allard began conducting a nationwide study of French centenarians, one of their software programs spat out an error message. An individual in the study was marked as 115 years old, a number outside the program’s range of acceptable age values. They called their collaborators in Arles, where the subject lived, and asked them to double-check the information they had provided, recalls Allard, who was then the director of the IPSEN Foundation, a nonprofit research organization. Perhaps they made a mistake when transcribing her birth date? Maybe this <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2019.2298">Jeanne Calment</a> was actually born in 1885, not 1875? No, the collaborators said. We’ve seen her birth certificate. The data is correct.</p><p>Calment was already well known in her hometown. Over the next few years, as rumors of her longevity spread, she became a celebrity. Her birthdays, which had been local holidays for a while, inspired national and, eventually, international news stories. Journalists, doctors and scientists began crowding her nursing-home room, eager to meet <em>la doyenne de l’humanité</em>. Everyone wanted to know her story.</p><p>Calment lived her entire life in the sunburned clay-and-cobble city of Arles in the South of France, where she married a second cousin and moved into a spacious apartment above the store he owned. She never needed to work, instead filling her days with leisurely pursuits: bicycling, painting, roller skating and hunting. She enjoyed a glass of port, a cigarette and some chocolate nearly every day. In town, she was known for her optimism, good humor and wit. (“I’ve never had but one wrinkle,” she once said, “and I’m sitting on it.”)</p><p>By age 88, Calment had outlived her parents, husband, only child, son-in-law and grandson. As she approached her 110th birthday, she was still living alone in her cherished apartment. One day, during a particularly severe winter, the pipes froze. She tried to thaw them with a flame, accidentally igniting the insulating material. Neighbors noticed the smoke and summoned the fire brigade, which rushed her to a hospital. Following the incident, Calment moved into La Maison du Lac, the nursing home situated on the hospital’s campus, where she would live until her death at age 122 in 1997.</p><p>In 1992, as Calment’s fame bloomed, Robine and Allard returned to her file. Clearly, here was someone special — someone who merited a case study. Arles was just an hour’s drive from the village where Robine, a demographer at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, lived at the time. He decided to arrange a visit. At La Maison du Lac, he introduced himself to the medical director, Victor Lèbre, and explained that he wanted to interview Calment. Lèbre replied that it was too late; Calment, he said, was completely deaf. But he agreed to let him meet the grande dame anyway. They walked down a long concrete corridor and into a small and spare room.</p><p>“Hello, Madame Calment,” Lèbre said.</p><p>“Good morning, doctor,” she answered without hesitation.</p><p>Lèbre was so shocked that he grabbed Robine by the arm and rushed him down the corridor back to his office, where he interrogated the nurses about Calment’s hearing. Apparently she could hear quite well at times, but experienced periods of near deafness; Lèbre had most likely mistaken one of those interludes for a permanent condition. Upon returning to Calment’s room, Robine saw her properly for the first time. She was sitting by the window in an armchair that dwarfed her shrunken frame. Her eyes, milky with cataracts, could distinguish light from dark, but did not focus on any place in particular. Her plain gray clothes appeared to be several decades old.</p><p>During that first meeting, Robine and Calment mostly exchanged pleasantries and idle chatter. Over the next few years, however, Robine and Allard, in collaboration with several other researchers and archivists, interviewed <a href="https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm">Calment dozens of times and thoroughly documented her life history,</a> verifying her age and cementing her reputation as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/74/Supplement_1/S13/5569844?login=true">the oldest person who ever lived. </a>Since then, Calment has become something of an emblem of the ongoing quest to answer one of history’s most controversial questions: What exactly is the limit on the human life span?</p><p>As medical and social advances mitigate diseases of old age and prolong life, the number of exceptionally long-lived people is increasing sharply. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047637416302548">The United Nations estimates that there were about 95,000 centenarians in 1990</a> and more than 450,000 in 2015. By 2100, there will be 25 million. Although the proportion of people who live beyond their 110th birthday is far smaller, this once-fabled milestone is also increasingly common in many wealthy nations. The first validated cases of such “supercentenarians” emerged in the 1960s. Since then, their global numbers have multiplied by a factor of at least 10, though no one knows precisely how many there are. In <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49970-9_10">Japan alone, the population of supercentenarians grew to 146 from 22 between 2005 and 2015,</a> a nearly sevenfold increase.</p><p>Given these statistics, you might expect that the record for longest life span would be increasing, too. Yet nearly a quarter-century after Calment’s death, no one is known to have matched, let alone surpassed, her 122 years. The closest was an American named Sarah Knauss, who died at age 119, two years after Calment. The oldest living person is Kane Tanaka, 118, who resides in Fukuoka, Japan. Very few people make it past 115. (A few researchers have even questioned whether Calment really lived as long as she claimed, though most accept her record as legitimate based on the weight of biographical evidence.)</p><p>As the global population approaches eight billion, and science discovers increasingly promising ways to slow or reverse aging in the lab, the question of human longevity’s potential limits is more urgent than ever. When their work is examined closely, it’s clear that longevity scientists hold a wide range of nuanced perspectives on the future of humanity. Historically, however — and somewhat flippantly, according to many researchers — their outlooks have been divided into two broad camps, which some journalists and researchers call the pessimists and the optimists. Those in the first group view life span as a candle wick that can burn for only so long. They generally think that we are rapidly approaching, or have already reached, a ceiling on life span, and that we will not witness anyone older than Calment anytime soon.</p><p>In contrast, the optimists see life span as a supremely, maybe even infinitely elastic band. They anticipate considerable gains in life expectancy around the world, increasing numbers of extraordinarily long-lived people — and eventually, supercentenarians who outlive Calment, pushing the record to 125, 150, 200 and beyond. Though unresolved, the long-running debate has already inspired a much deeper understanding of what defines and constrains life span — and of the interventions that may one day significantly extend it.</p><p>The theoretical limits on the length of a human life have vexed scientists and philosophers for thousands of years, but for most of history their discussions were largely based on musings and personal observations. In 1825, however, the British actuary <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4360127/">Benjamin Gompertz published a new mathematical model of mortality,</a> which demonstrated that the risk of death increased exponentially with age. Were that risk to continue accelerating throughout life, people would eventually reach a point at which they had essentially no chance of surviving to the next year. In other words, they would hit an effective limit on life span.</p><p>Instead, Gompertz observed that as people entered old age, the risk of death plateaued. “The limit to the possible duration of life is a subject not likely ever to be determined,” he wrote, “even should it exist.” Since then, using new data and more sophisticated mathematics, other scientists around the world have uncovered further evidence of accelerating death rates followed by mortality plateaus not only in humans but also in numerous other species, including <a href="http://longevity-science.org/pdf/Mortality-NAAJ-2011.pdf">rats, mice, shrimp, nematodes, fruit flies and beetles.</a></p><p>In 2016, an especially provocative study in the prestigious research journal Nature strongly implied that the authors had found the limit to the human life span. Jan Vijg, a geneticist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and two colleagues analyzed decades’ worth of mortality data from several countries and concluded that although the highest reported age at death in these countries increased rapidly between the 1970s and 1990s, it had failed to rise since then, stagnating at an average of 114.9 years. Human life span, it seemed, had arrived at its limit. Although some individuals, like Jeanne Calment, might reach staggering ages, they were outliers, not indicators of a continual lengthening of life.</p><p>While a few scientists from the more pessimistic tradition applauded the study, many researchers sternly critiqued its methods, in particular the bold generalization based on what one commentary called a “limited, noisy set of data.” Nearly a dozen rebuttals appeared in Nature and other journals. James Vaupel, the founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and a staunch critic of the idea that the human life span has reached its limit, called the study a travesty and <a href="http://showcase.casw.org/stories/peer-review-post-mortem-how-a-flawed-aging-study-was-published-in-nature/">told the science journalist Hester van Santen</a> that the authors “just shoveled the data into their computer like you’d shovel food into a cow.”</p><p>Robine remembers the furor well. He was one of several peer reviewers whom Nature recruited to evaluate the study by Vijg and his co-authors before publication. The first draft did not satisfy Robine’s standards, because it focused only on the United States and relied on data he considered incomplete. Among other changes, he recommended using the more comprehensive International Database on Longevity, which he and Vaupel developed with colleagues. <a href="http://showcase.casw.org/stories/peer-review-post-mortem-how-a-flawed-aging-study-was-published-in-nature/">Van Santen reported in a peer-review post-mortem</a> that, based on the substantial criticism by Robine and one of the other reviewers, Nature initially declined to publish the study. After Vijg and his co-authors sent Nature a thoroughly revised version, however, Robine conceded that the study was sound enough to publish, though he still disagreed with its conclusions. (Vijg stands by the methodology and conclusions of the study.)</p><p>Two years later, in 2018, the equally prestigious journal Science published a study that completely contradicted the one in Nature. The demographers Elisabetta Barbi of the University of Rome and Kenneth Wachter of the University of California, Berkeley, along with several colleagues, examined the survival trajectories of nearly 4,000 Italians and concluded that, while the risk of death increased exponentially up to age 80, it then slowed and eventually plateaued. Someone alive at 105 had about a 50 percent chance of living to the next year. The same was true at 106, 107, 108 and 109. Their findings, the authors wrote, “strongly suggest that longevity is continuing to increase over time, and that a limit, if any, has not been reached.”</p><p>Many of the disputes over human longevity studies center on the integrity of different data sets and the varying statistical methods researchers use to analyze them. Where one group of scientists perceives a clear trend, another suspects an illusion. Robine finds the debate exciting and essential. “I’m not convinced by my colleagues’ suggesting that life is or is not limited,” he told me. “I think the question is still here. We don’t yet know the best kind of analysis or study design to use to tackle this question. The most important thing to do today is to keep collecting the data.”</p><p>On their own, however, life-span statistics can tell us only so much. Such data have been available for centuries and have clearly not settled the debate. The number of supercentenarians may still be too small to support unequivocal conclusions about mortality rates in extreme old age. But in more recent decades, scientists have made considerable progress toward understanding the evolutionary origins of longevity and the biology of aging. Instead of fixating on human demographics, this research considers all species on the planet and tries to derive general principles about duration of life and timing of death.</p><p>“I’m a little surprised that anyone today would question whether or not there is a limit,” S. Jay Olshansky, an expert on longevity and a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told me. “It doesn’t really matter whether there is a plateau of mortality or not in extreme old age. There are so few people that make it up there, and the risk of death at that point is so high, that most people aren’t going to live much beyond the limits we see today.”</p><p>Olshansky, 67, has argued for decades that life span is obviously limited and that the mathematical models of feuding demographers are secondary to the biological realities of aging. He likes to make an analogy to athletics: “Could someone run a two-minute mile? No. The human body is incapable of moving that fast based on anatomical limitations. The same thing applies to human longevity.”</p><p>He is so thoroughly convinced of his position that he has backed it with an investment that may eventually grow to a sizable fortune for him or his heirs. In 2000, Steven Austad, a biologist now at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told Scientific American, “The first 150-year-old person is probably alive right now.” When Olshansky disagreed, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/scientists-up-stakes-in-bet-on-whether-humans-will-live-to-150-1.20818#/b1">the two struck up a friendly bet</a>: Each put $150 in an investment fund and signed a contract stipulating that the winner or his descendants would claim the returns in 2150. After the Vijg paper was published, they doubled their contributions. Olshansky originally invested the funds in gold and later in Tesla. He estimates the value will be well over $1 billion when it’s time to collect. “Oh, I am going to win,” Olshansky said when I asked him how he currently feels about the wager. “Ultimately, biology will determine which one of us is right. That’s why I’m so confident.”</p><p>Embedded in the question of the human life span’s limits is a more fundamental enigma: Why do we — why does any organism — get old and die in the first place? As the eminent physicist Richard Feynman put it in a 1964 lecture, “There is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death.”</p><p>Some organisms seem to be living proof of this claim. Scientists recently drilled into sediments deep beneath the seafloor and unearthed microbes that had probably survived “in a metabolically active form” for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7387439/">more than 100 million years.</a> Pando, a 106-acre clonal colony of genetically identical aspen trees connected by a single root system in Utah, is thought to have sustained itself for as long as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5498503/">14,000 years and counting.</a></p><p>A few creatures are so ageless that some scientists regard them as biologically immortal. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3511741/">Hydra,</a> tiny relatives of jellyfish and corals, do not appear to age at all and can regenerate whole new bodies when sliced into pieces. When injured or threatened, a sexually mature <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893190/">Turritopsis dohrnii,</a> the immortal jellyfish, can revert to its juvenile stage, mature and revert again, potentially forever. Biologically immortal organisms are not impervious to death — they can still perish from predation, lethal injury or infection — but they do not seem to die of their own accord. Theoretically, any organism with a continual supply of energy, a sufficient capacity for self-maintenance and repair and the good fortune to evade all environmental hazards could survive until the end of the universe.</p><p>Why, then, do so many species expire so dependably? Most longevity researchers agree that aging, the set of physical processes of damage and decay that result in death, is not an adaptive trait shaped by natural selection. Rather, aging is a byproduct of selection’s waning power over the course of an organism’s life. Selection acts most strongly on genes and traits that help living creatures survive adolescence and reproduce. In many species, the few individuals who make it to old age are practically invisible to natural selection because they are no longer passing on their genes, nor helping raise their relatives’ progeny.</p><p>As the British biologist Peter Medawar observed in the 1950s, harmful genetic mutations that are not expressed until late in life could accumulate across generations because selection is too weak to remove them, eventually resulting in specieswide aging. The American biologist George C. Williams elaborated on Medawar’s ideas, adding that some genes may be beneficial in youth but detrimental later on, when selection would overlook their disadvantages. Similarly, in the 1970s, the British biologist Thomas Kirkwood proposed that aging was partly due to an evolutionary trade-off between growth and reproduction on the one hand and day-to-day maintenance on the other. Devoting resources to maintenance is advantageous only if an organism is likely to continue surviving and reproducing. For many organisms, external threats are too great and numerous to endure for very long, so there is not much evolutionary pressure to preserve their bodies in old age, resulting in their deterioration.</p><p>But that still leaves the question of why there is such huge variation in life span among species. Biologists think life span is largely determined by a species’ anatomy and lifestyle. Small and highly vulnerable animals tend to reproduce quickly and die not long after, whereas larger animals, and those with sophisticated defenses, usually reproduce later in life and live longer overall. Ground-dwelling birds, for instance, often have shorter life spans than strong-winged, tree-nesting species, which are less susceptible to predators. Naked mole rats, which enjoy the cooperative benefits of tight-knit social groups and the protection of subterranean chambers, live five to 10 times longer than other similarly sized mammals.</p><p>A few species, like stalwart clonal trees with resilient root systems, are so well protected against environmental hazards that they don’t have to prioritize early growth and reproduction over long-term maintenance, allowing them to live an extraordinarily long time. Others, like the immortal jellyfish and hydra, are potentially indefinite, because they have retained primordial powers of rejuvenation that have been relegated to pockets of stem cells in most adult vertebrates.</p><p>Humans have never belonged to the select society of the everlasting. We most likely inherited fairly long life spans from our last common ancestor with chimpanzees, which may have been a large, intelligent, social ape that lived in trees away from ground predators. But we never out-evolved the eventual senescence that is part of being a complex animal with all manner of metabolically costly adaptations and embellishments.</p><p>As the years pass, our chromosomes contract and fracture, genes turn on and off haphazardly, mitochondria break down, proteins unravel or clump together, reserves of regenerative stem cells dwindle, bodily cells stop dividing, bones thin, muscles shrivel, neurons wither, organs become sluggish and dysfunctional, the immune system weakens and self-repair mechanisms fail. There is no programmed death clock ticking away inside us — no precise expiration date hard-wired into our species — but, eventually, the human body just can’t keep going.</p><p>Social advances and improving public health may further increase life expectancy and lift some supercentenarians well beyond Calment’s record. Even the most optimistic longevity scientists admit, however, that at some point these environmentally induced gains will run up against human biology’s limits — unless, that is, we fundamentally alter our biology.</p><p>Many scientists who study aging think that biomedical breakthroughs are the only way to substantially increase the human life span, but some doubt that anyone alive today will witness such radical interventions; a few doubt they are even possible. In any case, longevity scientists agree, significantly elongating life without sustaining well-being is pointless, and enhancing vitality in old age is valuable regardless of gains in maximum life span.</p><p>One of the many obstacles to these goals is the overwhelming complexity of aging in mammals and other vertebrates. Researchers have achieved astonishing results by tweaking the genome of the roundworm C. elegans, extending its life span nearly 10 times — the equivalent of a person’s living 1,000 years. Although scientists have used caloric restriction, genetic engineering and various drugs to stretch life span in more complex species, including fish, rodents and monkeys, the gains have never been as sharp as in roundworms, and the precise mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear.</p><p>More recently, however, researchers have tested particularly innovative techniques for reversing and postponing some aspects of aging, with tentative but promising results. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082705/">James Kirkland, an expert on aging at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has demonstrated </a>with colleagues that certain drug cocktails purge old mice of senescent cells, granting them more than a month of additional healthy living. Their research has already inspired numerous human clinical trials.</p><p>At the same time, at the University of California, Berkeley, the married bioengineers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121415/">Irina and Michael Conboy are investigating</a> ways to filter or dilute aged blood in rodents to remove molecules that inhibit healing, which in turn stimulates cellular regeneration and the production of revitalizing compounds.</p><p>In a study published in Nature in December 2020, David Sinclair, a director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging Research at Harvard Medical School, along with colleagues, partly restored vision in middle-aged and ailing mice by reprogramming their gene expression. The researchers injected the mice’s eyes with a benign virus carrying genes that revert mature cells to a more supple, stem-cell-like state, which allowed their neurons to regenerate — an ability that mammals usually lose after infancy. “Aging is far more reversible than we thought,” Sinclair told me. “Cells can clean themselves up, they can get rid of old proteins, they can rejuvenate, if you turn on the youthful genes through this reset process.”</p><p>Known for his boyish features and sanguine predictions, Sinclair, 51, and several of his family members (including his dogs) follow versions of his life-prolonging regimen, which has, over the years, included regular exercise, sauna steams and ice baths, a two-meal-a-day mostly vegetarian diet, the diabetes drug metformin (which is purported to have anti-aging properties) and several vitamins and supplements, like the once-hyped but ultimately disappointing red-wine miracle molecule resveratrol. Sinclair has also founded at least 12 biotech companies and serves on the boards of several more, one of which is already pursuing human clinical trials of a gene therapy based on his recent Nature study.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">a talk at Google,</a> he envisioned a future in which people receive similar treatments every decade or so to undo the effects of aging throughout the body. “We don’t know how many times you can reset,” he said. “It might be three, it might be 3,000. And if you can reset your body 3,000 times, then things get really interesting. I don’t know if any of you want to live for 1,000 years, but I also don’t know if it’s going to be possible, but these are the questions we have to start thinking about. Because it’s not a question of if — it’s now a question of when.”</p><p>Longevity scientists who favor the idea of living for centuries or longer tend to speak effusively of prosperity and possibility. As they see it, sustaining life and promoting health are intrinsically good and, therefore, so are any medical interventions that accomplish this. Biomedically extended longevity would not only revolutionize general well-being by minimizing or preventing diseases of aging, they say, it would also vastly enrich human experience. It would mean the chance for several fulfilling and diverse careers; the freedom to explore much more of the world; the joy of playing with your great-great-great-grandchildren; the satisfaction of actually sitting in the shade of the tree you planted so long ago. Imagine, some say, how wise our future elders could be. Imagine what the world’s most brilliant minds could accomplish with all that time.</p><p>In sharp contrast, other experts argue that extending life span, even in the name of health, is a doomed pursuit. Perhaps the most common concern is the potential for overpopulation, especially considering humanity’s long history of hoarding and squandering resources and the tremendous socioeconomic inequalities that already divide a world of nearly eight billion. There are still dozens of countries where life expectancy is below 65, primarily because of problems like poverty, famine, limited education, disempowerment of women, poor public health and diseases like malaria and H.I.V./AIDS, which novel and expensive life-extending treatments will do nothing to solve.</p><p>Lingering multitudes of superseniors, some experts add, would stifle new generations and impede social progress. “There is a wisdom to the evolutionary process of letting the older generation disappear,” said Paul Root Wolpe, the director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University, during <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/04/aging-extending-human-life/">one public debate on life extension.</a> “If the World War I generation and World War II generation and perhaps, you know, the Civil War generation were still alive, do you really think that we would have civil rights in this country? Gay marriage?”</p><p>In her final years at La Maison du Lac, the once-athletic Jeanne Calment was essentially immobile, confined to her bed and wheelchair. Her hearing continued to decline, she was virtually blind and she had trouble speaking. At times, it was not clear that she was fully aware of her surroundings.</p><p>By some accounts, those in charge of Calment’s care failed to shield her from undue commotion and questionable interactions as journalists, tourists and spectators bustled in and out of her room. Following the release of an investigative documentary, the hospital director barred all visitors. The last time Robine saw her was shortly after her 120th birthday. About two years later, in the midst of an especially hot summer, Jeanne Calment died alone in her nursing-home room from unknown causes and was quickly buried. Only a few people were permitted to attend her funeral. Robine and Allard were not among them. Neither was Calment’s family: All her close relatives had been dead for more than three decades.</p><p>“Today, more people are surviving the major diseases of old age and entering a new phase of their life in which they become very weak,” Robine said. “We still don’t know how to avoid frailty.”</p><p>Perhaps the most unpredictable consequence of uncoupling life span from our inherited biology is how it would alter our future psychology. All of human culture evolved with the understanding that earthly life is finite and, in the grand scheme, relatively brief. If we are one day born knowing that we can reasonably expect to live 200 years or longer, will our minds easily accommodate this unparalleled scope of life? Or is our neural architecture, which evolved amid the perils of the Pleistocene, inherently unsuited for such vast horizons?</p><p>Scientists, philosophers and writers have long feared that a surfeit of time would exhaust all meaningful experience, culminating in debilitating levels of melancholy and listlessness. Maybe the desire for all those extra years masks a deeper longing for something unattainable: not for a life that is simply longer, but for one that is long enough to feel utterly perfect and complete.</p><p>In Jorge Luis Borges’s short story “The Immortal,” a Roman military officer stumbles upon a “secret river that purifies men of death.” After drinking from it and spending eons in deep thought, he realizes that death imbues life with value, whereas, for immortals, “Nothing can occur but once, nothing is preciously <em>in peril of being lost</em>.” Determined to find the antidote to everlasting life, he wanders the planet for nearly a millennium. One day, he drinks from a spring of clear water on the Eritrean coast and shortly thereafter scratches the back of his hand on a thorny tree. Startled by an unfamiliar twinge of pain, he searches for a sign of injury. As a drop of blood slowly pools on his skin — proof of his restored mortality — he simply watches, “incredulous, speechless, and in joy.”</p><p><a id="has-an-old-soviet-mystery-at-last-been-solved"></a></p><h1 id="Has-an-Old-Soviet-Mystery-at-Last-Been-Solved"><a href="#Has-an-Old-Soviet-Mystery-at-Last-Been-Solved" class="headerlink" title="Has an Old Soviet Mystery at Last Been Solved?"></a>Has an Old Soviet Mystery at Last Been Solved?</h1><p>The strange fate of a group of skiers in the Ural Mountains has generated endless speculation.</p><p>来源: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/17/has-an-old-soviet-mystery-at-last-been-solved">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/17/has-an-old-soviet-mystery-at-last-been-solved</a></p><p>Igor Dyatlov was a tinkerer, an inventor, and a devotee of the wilderness. Born in 1936, near Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), he built radios as a kid and loved camping. When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, in 1957, he constructed a telescope so that he and his friends could watch the satellite travel across the night sky. By then, he was an engineering student at the city’s Ural Polytechnic Institute. One of the leading technical universities in the country, U.P.I. turned out topflight engineers to work in the nuclear-power and weapons industries, communications, and military engineering. During his years there, Dyatlov led a number of arduous wilderness trips, often using outdoor equipment that he had invented or improved on. It was a time of optimism in the U.S.S.R. Khrushchev’s Thaw had freed many political prisoners from Stalin’s Gulag, economic growth was robust, and the standard of living was rising. The shock that the success of Sputnik delivered to the West further bolstered national confidence. In late 1958, Dyatlov began planning a winter expedition that would exemplify the boldness and vigor of a new Soviet generation: an ambitious sixteen-day cross-country ski trip in the Urals, the north-south mountain range that divides western Russia from Siberia, and thus Europe from Asia.</p><p>He submitted his proposal to the U.P.I. sports club, which readily approved it. Dyatlov’s itinerary lay three hundred and fifty miles north of Sverdlovsk, in the traditional territory of the Mansi, an indigenous people. The Mansi came into contact with Russians around the sixteenth century, when Russia was extending its control over Siberia. Though largely Russified by this time, the Mansi continued to pursue a semi-traditional way of life—hunting, fishing, and reindeer herding. Dyatlov’s group would ski two hundred miles, on a route that no Russian, as far as anyone knew, had taken before. The mountains were gentle and rounded, their barren slopes rising from a vast boreal forest of birch and fir. The challenge wouldn’t be rugged terrain but brutally cold temperatures, deep snow, and high winds.</p><p>Dyatlov recruited his classmate Zina Kolmogorova, and seven other fellow-students and recent graduates. They were among the élite of Soviet youth and all highly experienced winter campers and cross-country skiers. One was Dyatlov’s close friend Georgy Krivonishchenko, who had graduated from U.P.I. two years before and worked as an engineer at the Mayak nuclear complex, in the then secret town of Chelyabinsk-40. Jug-eared, small, and wiry, he told jokes, sang, and played the mandolin. Two other recent graduates were Rustem Slobodin and Nikolay Thibault-Brignoles, of French descent, whose father had been worked nearly to death in one of Stalin’s camps. The other students included Yuri Yudin, Yuri Doroshenko, and Aleksandr Kolevatov. The youngest of the group, at twenty, was Lyuda Dubinina, an economics major, a track athlete, and an ardent Communist, who wore her long blond hair in braids tied with silk ribbons. On a previous wilderness outing, Dubinina had been accidentally shot by a hunter, and survived—quite cheerfully, it was said—a fifty-mile journey back to civilization. A couple of days before the group was due to set off, the U.P.I. administration unexpectedly added a new member, much older than the others and largely unknown to them: Semyon Zolotaryov, a thirty-seven-year-old veteran of the Second World War with an old-fashioned mustache, stainless-steel crowns on his teeth, and tattoos.</p><p>The party left Sverdlovsk by train on January 23rd. Several of them hid under seats to avoid buying tickets. They were in high spirits—so high that on a layover between trains Krivonishchenko was briefly detained by police for playing his mandolin and pretending to panhandle in the train station. We know these details because there was a communal journal, and many of the skiers also kept personal journals. At least five had cameras, and the pictures they took show a lively and strikingly handsome group of young people having the adventure of their lives—skiing, laughing, playing in the snow, and mugging for the camera.</p><p>After two days on trains, the party reached Ivdel, a remote town with a Stalin-era prison camp that, by then, held mostly criminals. From there the group travelled another day by bus, then in the back of a woodcutter’s truck, and finally by ski, guided by a horse-drawn sleigh. They slept in an abandoned logging camp called Second Northern. There Yuri Yudin had a flareup of sciatica that forced him to pull out of the trip. The next day, January 28th, he turned back, while the remaining nine set off toward the mountains. The plan was to end up at the tiny village of Vizhai around February 12th, and telegram the U.P.I. sports club that they had arrived safely. The expected telegram never came.</p><p>At first, the U.P.I. sports club assumed that the group had just been held up; there had been reports of a heavy snowstorm in the mountains. But, after several days passed, families of the group began placing frantic phone calls to the university and to the local bureau of the Communist Party, and, on February 20th, a search was launched. There were several search parties: student volunteers from U.P.I., prison guards from the Ivdel camp, Mansi hunters, local police; the military deployed planes and helicopters. On February 25th, the students found ski tracks, and the next day they discovered the skiers’ tent—above the tree line on a remote mountain that Soviet officials referred to as Height 1079 and that the Mansi called Kholat Syakhl, or Dead Mountain. There was no one inside.</p><p>The tent was partly collapsed and largely buried in snow. After digging it out, the search party saw that the tent appeared to have been deliberately slashed in several places. Yet, inside, everything was neat and orderly. The skiers’ boots, axes, and other equipment were arranged on either side of the door. Food was laid out as if about to be eaten; there was a stack of wood for a heating stove, and clothes, cameras, and journals.</p><p>About a hundred feet downhill, the search party found “very distinct” footprints of eight or nine people, walking (not running) toward the tree line. Almost all the prints were of stockinged feet, some even bare. One person appeared to be wearing a single ski boot. “Some of the prints indicated that the person was either barefoot or in socks because you could see the toes,” a searcher later testified. The party followed the prints downhill for six to seven hundred yards, until they vanished near the tree line.</p><p>The next morning, searchers found the bodies of the mandolin player Krivonishchenko and the student Doroshenko under a tall cedar tree at the edge of the forest. They were lying next to a dead fire, wearing only underwear. Twelve to fifteen feet up the tree were some recently broken branches, and on the trunk bits of skin and torn clothes were found. Later that day, a search party discovered the bodies of Dyatlov and Kolmogorova. Both were farther up the slope, facing in the direction of the tent, their fists tightly clenched. They seemed to have been trying to get back there.</p><p>The four bodies were autopsied, while the search for the others continued. The medical examiner noted a number of bizarre features. Krivonishchenko had blackened fingers and third-degree burns on a shin and a foot. Inside his mouth was a chunk of flesh that he had bitten off his right hand. Doroshenko’s body had burned hair on one side of the head and a charred sock. All the bodies were covered with bruises, abrasions, scratches, and cuts, as was a fifth body, that of the recent graduate Slobodin, which was discovered a few days later. Like Dyatlov and Kolmogorova, Slobodin was on the slope leading back to the tent, with a sock on one foot and a felt bootie on the other; his autopsy noted a minor fracture to his skull.</p><p>By now, a homicide investigation was under way, led by a prosecutor in his mid-thirties named Lev Ivanov. Toxicology tests were done, witness testimony taken, diagrams and maps made of the scene, and evidence gathered and forensically analyzed. The tent and its contents were helicoptered out of the mountains and set up again inside a police station. This led to a key discovery: a seamstress who came to the station to do a uniform fitting happened to notice that the slashes in the tent had been made from the inside.</p><p>Something had happened that induced the skiers to cut their way out of the tent and flee into the night, into a howling blizzard, in twenty-below-zero temperatures, in bare feet or socks. They were not novices to the winter mountains; they would have been acutely aware of the fatal consequences of leaving the tent half dressed in those conditions. This is the central, and apparently inexplicable, mystery of the incident.</p><p>Four bodies remained missing. In early May, when the snow began to melt, a Mansi hunter and his dog came across the remains of a makeshift snow den in the woods two hundred and fifty feet from the cedar tree: a floor of branches laid in a deep hole in the snow. Pieces of tattered clothing were found strewn about: black cotton sweatpants with the right leg cut off, the left half of a woman’s sweater. Another search team arrived and, using avalanche probes around the den, they brought up a piece of flesh. Excavation uncovered the four remaining victims, lying together in a rocky streambed under at least ten feet of snow. The autopsies revealed catastrophic injuries to three of them. Thibault-Brignoles’s skull was fractured so severely that pieces of bone had been driven into the brain. Zolotaryov and Dubinina had crushed chests with multiple broken ribs, and the autopsy report noted a massive hemorrhage in the right ventricle of Dubinina’s heart. The medical examiner said the damage was similar to what is typically seen as the “result of an impact of an automobile moving at high speed.” Yet none of the bodies had external penetrating wounds, though Zolotaryov’s was missing its eyes, and Dubinina’s was missing its eyes, tongue, and part of the upper lip.</p><p>A careful inventory of clothing recovered from the bodies revealed that some of these victims were wearing clothes taken or cut off the bodies of others, and a laboratory found that several items emitted unnaturally high levels of radiation. A radiological expert testified that, because the bodies had been exposed to running water for months, these levels of radiation must originally have been “many times greater.”</p><p>On May 28th, Ivanov abruptly closed the investigation. His role was to determine whether a crime had been committed, not to clarify what had happened, and he concluded that homicide was not a factor. Ivanov ended his report with a non-explanation that has bedevilled Dyatlov researchers ever since: “It should be concluded that the cause of the hikers’ demise was an overwhelming force, which they were not able to overcome.”</p><p>In classic Soviet style, a number of officials who had little to do with the tragedy were either punished or fired, including the director of U.P.I. and the chairman of its sports club, the local Communist Party secretary, the chairmen of two workers’ unions, and a union inspector. The investigative files, photographs, and journals were classified and the area around Dead Mountain was placed off limits to skiers and outdoor enthusiasts for years. The tent was stored but eventually became moldy and had to be thrown out. The saddle in the mountains which the skiers were heading for but never reached was named the Dyatlov Pass.</p><p>The victims’ families were left deeply dissatisfied. Many of them wrote to officials, including Khrushchev, demanding a more thorough investigation. But nothing more was done, and the mysterious deaths of the nine skiers subsided into relative obscurity.</p><p>In 1990, the prosecutor Ivanov, who had retired, published an article in which he claimed that, while compiling his 1959 report, he’d been pressured not to include his views on what happened. The article, titled “The Enigma of the Fireballs,” said that the skiers had been killed by heat rays or balls of fire associated with U.F.O.s. In his original examination of the scene, Ivanov had found trees with unusual burn marks, which “confirmed that some kind of heat ray, say, or a powerful force whose nature is completely unknown (to us, at least) acted selectively on specific objects”—in this case, people. The last photograph in Krivonishchenko’s camera showed flares and streaks of light against a black background.</p><p>By then, the official files had been released and, in the decades since, the case has become one of the most celebrated mysteries of the Soviet era. It has generated dozens of books and documentaries, along with a slew of Web sites and message boards on which Dyatlov obsessives trade scores of theories—the official count of the Russian Prosecutor General’s office lists seventy-five—about what happened. In 2000, relatives and friends of the victims established the Dyatlov Group Memorial Foundation, whose purpose is to honor the memory of the skiers and seek the truth. Its president is Yuri Kuntsevich, who, as a twelve-year-old boy, attended the funerals of some of the victims. He went on to study and teach at U.P.I. (which has since become the Ural State Technical University) and to join its sports club. Now in his mid-seventies, he still leads tours to the Dyatlov Pass. Kuntsevich told me that Russians generally favor one of two theories: the skiers died because they had stumbled into an area where secret weapons were being tested; alternatively, the party was “killed by mercenaries,” probably American spies.</p><p>Kuntsevich insists that the first of these theories is the correct one, and it’s also what the families tend to believe. The idea is that a missile launch of some kind went disastrously wrong, inflicting severe injuries on some of the skiers and forcing the group to flee their tent, at which point they either froze to death or were killed by military observers. Yuri Yudin, whose sciatica compelled him to abandon the trip, likewise maintained that the deaths were not natural. Not long before he died, in 2013, he declared that his teammates had been taken from the tent at gunpoint and murdered. Dubinina, he said, may have had her tongue cut out by the killers because she was the most outspoken of the group.</p><p>Proponents of the weapons-test theory cite claims from people in the region that they had seen flashes of light or moving balls of fire in the direction of the mountains. In 2008, a three-foot-long piece of metal was found in the area; according to the Dyatlov Foundation, which took possession of it, the metal is part of a Soviet ballistic missile. Military tests would explain the radioactivity of recovered clothing. Yevgeny Okishev, Ivanov’s supervisor in the Prosecutor General’s office, gave an interview to a newspaper in 2013, in which he recalled finding it suspicious when he and his colleagues were instructed to test recovered items for radiation. He sent a letter to his superiors asking why radiation was relevant. In response, the Deputy Prosecutor General met with the team. Okishev said that the official dodged questions about weapons testing and ordered them to tell people that the deaths were accidental. “The victims’ parents came to my office, some screamed and called us Fascists for hiding the truth from them,” Okishev recalled. “But the case was closed, and not on our orders.”</p><p>The theory, however, is not consistent with what was found at the site. There was no evidence that other people had been there. Snow does not lie: it would have been close to impossible to erase signs of the people and equipment involved in killing the group and restaging the scene. Besides, why make the staging so elaborate and bizarre? Why scatter the bodies around the landscape, cut off the clothing of some and dress others in it, build a snow den, bury four bodies in ten feet of snow, light a fire, and climb a tree to break branches, leaving skin on the bark? The theory would also suggest that there was a secret weapons base in the area, or that an errant missile had exploded over it. Yet, despite the mass declassification of documents from the Soviet era and the diligent searches of Dyatlov enthusiasts, no such evidence has emerged.</p><p>The K.G.B. theory centers on Zolotaryov, the man who was foisted on the group at the last minute. A book published in Russia claims that he and two other skiers were K.G.B. agents on an assignment to meet with a group of C.I.A. operatives, to furnish them with deliberately misleading information. Samples of clothing contaminated by radioactive isotopes were to be offered as bait; the C.I.A. agents discovered the deception, killed them, and staged the scene. It is certainly possible that Zolotaryov had a K.G.B. link. His service record in the Second World War had holes and inconsistencies, and his sudden inclusion certainly seems suspicious. Still, a K.G.B. connection, even if proved, wouldn’t mean much; many people were low-level informants at the time. And the idea that the C.I.A. would have chosen a place like Dead Mountain for a rendezvous strains credulity.</p><p>Another class of theories considers a variety of natural disasters. An avalanche, perhaps, struck the tent, causing the crushing injuries to three of the victims and forcing the whole group to cut their way out and head to the forest for shelter. But no avalanche debris was found—a ski pole holding up the front of the tent was still standing—and the original investigation determined that the slope was too shallow to generate an avalanche. Besides, the injuries to the three victims found in the streambed were totally incapacitating. They could never have made it there unassisted—it was more than a mile from the tent—but the tracks leading downhill showed no signs of anyone being dragged. There were eight or nine separate sets of footprints, so the fatal injuries must have come after everyone had left the tent. A 2013 best-seller by the filmmaker and writer Donnie Eichar suggests that high winds passing over the mountain created infrasound‚ vibrations below the range of human hearing, and that this induced such terror that the skiers fled. Much about the book is excellent—Eichar conducted many interviews in Russia and travelled to the Dyatlov Pass in winter—but his thesis would require all nine people to have been so terrified of a sound they couldn’t even hear that they ran to certain death, not grabbing their coats or boots, and slashing their way out, when the tent door would have made for a far easier exit.</p><p>Various hypotheses considered in the 1959 inquest have also been raked over: carbon-monoxide poisoning from the heater; sudden madness caused by consuming bad alcohol or hallucinogenic mushrooms that the Mansi sometimes hung on trees to dry; or even murder by the Mansi themselves, if, for instance, the party had strayed onto sacred land. But the autopsies ruled out the first two of these, and when the original investigators interviewed the local Mansi they found them “well disposed toward Russians,” and believable. The Mansi had provided valuable help in the search, and they told the investigators that the area was not sacred; on the contrary, it was considered windy, barren, and worthless.</p><p>By far the most entertaining theory is that the party was attacked by a yeti. The final photograph found in Thibault-Brignoles’s camera has become famous: a dark figure advancing through the snowy forest, hunched and menacing, with no facial features. The Discovery Channel built an entire show, “Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives,” around the image. The skiers actually had been joking about yetis a few hours before they died. A spoof propaganda leaflet was found in the tent. Alongside such items as “Greeting the XXI Congress with increased birthrate among hikers” was the following: “Science: In recent years there has been a heated debate about the existence of the Yeti. Latest evidence indicates that the Yeti lives in the northern Urals, near Mount Otorten.” Still, the photograph, though blurry, pretty clearly shows a member of the group. Similarly, the Krivonishchenko image of streaks of light, which has been used to bolster the U.F.O. and weapons-test theories, is typical of the end of a film roll.</p><p>All the Dyatlov theories share a basic assumption that the full story has not been told. In a place where information has been as tightly controlled as in the former Soviet Union, mistrust of official narratives is natural, and nothing in the record can explain why people would leave a tent undressed, in near-suicidal fashion. For decades, the families and the Dyatlov Group Memorial Foundation pressed for a new investigation; two years ago, elderly relatives of several victims finally succeeded in getting the case reopened.</p><p>A young prosecutor in Yekaterinburg, Andrei Kuryakov, was put in charge. In 2019, he organized a winter expedition to the site. His team took measurements, surveyed, photographed, and conducted a variety of experiments. Using photogrammetry of the pictures taken in 1959, they tried to establish the precise location of the tent. The spot they settled on was several hundred feet from a cairn marking the previously accepted location, on a steeper section of Kholat Syakhl’s slope. Combing through historical data, the investigators determined that weather conditions on the mountain that night were even more extreme than had been thought. The skiers were engulfed in a storm with winds of up to sixty-five miles an hour and temperatures around minus thirty degrees Fahrenheit. As evening fell, they were probably unsure of their precise location.</p><p>From the outset, Kuryakov adopted an intentionally narrow scope, dismissing seventy-two of the seventy-five explanations for what may have happened. “A large class of these seventy-five versions are conspiracy theories alleging that the authorities were somehow involved in the incident,” he said, when announcing the investigation. “We have already proved that this is absolutely false.” This left the investigation with three natural occurrences to consider: an avalanche, a hurricane, and a slab of snow sliding over the tent. Last July, Kuryakov held a televised press conference in which he told his audience that the last of these was the definitive explanation.</p><p>Two photographs taken by the Dyatlov party at around 5 p.m., while they pitched the tent, show that they cut deeply into the snowpack at right angles to the slope, forming a hollow. They had picked a spot where the mountain peak offered some shelter from the strongest winds. Later in the evening, Kuryakov said, a snow slab detached from the slope above and buried most of the tent, pinning down the occupants and possibly causing injuries. Fearing that a full-scale avalanche was imminent, the skiers cut their way out of the downslope side of the tent and fled to a rock ridge a hundred and fifty feet away, which Kuryakov termed a “natural avalanche limiter.” But the big avalanche didn’t come, and, in pitch darkness, they were unable to find their way back to the tent and took shelter in the woods, a mile away. Kuryakov tested this theory by blindfolding a man and a woman and leading them ninety feet downhill from a tent. Asked to find their way back, they quickly went astray. The task would have been even more difficult in a blizzard, with most of the tent buried in snow.</p><p>Analyzing 1959 photographs, many Dyatlov researchers had calculated that the tent was pitched on a slope of some fifteen degrees, which is not steep enough to sustain the movement of snow in cold conditions. The new position of the tent as determined by Kuryakov’s topographical experts was therefore crucial, because the gradient here was between twenty-three and twenty-six degrees, enough for avalanche formation. A paper corroborating much of Kuryakov’s explanation was published in January by two Swiss engineers in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment. Creating a mathematical model of the snow structure that night, the researchers showed why the slab didn’t release immediately when the group cut into it, but only hours later: additional loading of snow during the storm was responsible.</p><p>I reviewed the hypothesis with Ethan Greene, the director of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, who has a Ph.D. in the physics of heat and mass transfer in snow. He suggested that the party’s decision to pitch the tent in the wind shadow of the peak made it likely that they were cutting into a so-called wind slab—an accumulation of hard snow even more dangerous than a typical snow slab. Compacted by the wind, this kind of snow is several times denser than directly deposited snow and, according to Greene, can weigh as much as six hundred and seventy pounds per cubic yard. Furthermore, the clear conditions preceding the storm could have led to the formation of a layer of light, feathery frost, known as surface hoar. When buried in fresh snow during the storm, this layer forms a hazardous stratum that provides poor support to the snow above and often releases, resulting in avalanches. By removing the support on the lower edge of the slab while digging to set their tent, the skiers likely caused it to fracture higher up.</p><p>If the wind slab had simply slid over the tent and halted, without developing into a full-fledged avalanche, the evidence, Greene said, might not be visible twenty-five days later. Even the fissure in the snowpack would probably have been erased by the elements. If a three-foot-thick slab moved over the tent, each skier’s body would have been covered by more than a thousand pounds. The massive weight prevented them from retrieving their boots or warm clothing and forced them to cut their way out of the downslope side of the tent.</p><p>The two Swiss researchers believe that the snow slab probably caused the terrible injuries to three of the skiers found at the snow den, but this remains unlikely, given the distance of those bodies from the tent. Kuryakov’s explanation was more ingenious. The nine skiers retreated downhill, taking shelter under the cedar tree and building a fire. Because the young trees nearby were icy and wet, someone climbed the cedar to break branches higher up—hence the skin and scraps of clothing found on the trunk. The fire they built, in these extreme conditions, was not enough to save them, however. The two most poorly dressed of the group died first. The burned skin on their bodies came from their desperate efforts to seek warmth from the fire. This would suggest that the piece of flesh Krivonishchenko bit from his finger was probably a result of the delirium that overtakes someone who’s dying of hypothermia, or perhaps from an attempt to test for sensation in a frostbitten hand.</p><p>The surviving skiers cut the clothes off their dead comrades and dressed themselves in the remnants. At some point, the group split up. Three skiers, including Dyatlov, tried to return to the tent and soon froze to death as they struggled uphill. The other four, who were better dressed, decided to build a snow den to shelter in overnight. They needed deep snow, which they found in a ravine a couple of hundred feet away. Unfortunately, the spot they picked lay above a stream, a tributary of the Lozva River. The stream, which never freezes, had hollowed out a deep icy tunnel, and the group’s digging caused its roof to collapse, throwing them onto the rocky streambed and burying them in ten to fifteen feet of snow. The pressure of tons of snow forcing them against the rocks caused the traumatic injuries found in this group. The gruesome facial damage—the missing tongue, eyes, and lip—probably resulted from scavenging by small animals and from decomposition.</p><p>Kuryakov’s reconstruction of events made a single plausible narrative out of previously mystifying anomalies. But what of the radiation? This detail, the most enigmatic of all, might be the easiest to explain. For one thing, the mantles used in camp lanterns at the time contained small amounts of the radioactive element thorium. Even more pertinent, the expedition took place less than two years after the world’s third-worst nuclear accident (after Chernobyl and Fukushima), which occurred at the Mayak nuclear complex, south of Sverdlovsk, in September of 1957. A tank of radioactive waste exploded and a radioactive plume some two hundred miles long—later named the East Urals Radioactive Trace—spread northward. Krivonishchenko had worked at the facility and helped with the cleanup, and another skier came from a village in the contaminated zone.</p><p>Kuryakov closed his press conference by declaring, “Formally, this is it. The case is closed.” Given how freighted the case is in Russia, this was too optimistic. For many people, nature alone cannot explain a tragedy of this magnitude; perpetrators must be identified and the state and its dark past invoked. Sure enough, the conclusions were greeted with scorn, especially by the families of the dead. The Dyatlov Group Memorial Foundation sent a letter to the Prosecutor General declaring that, in its view, the skiers’ deaths were caused by “the atmospheric release of a powerful toxic substance” when a secret weapons test went wrong. Natalia Varsegova, a Moscow journalist, who has covered the subject for many years, also rejected Kuryakov’s conclusions. “Two years ago I thought that the prosecutor Andrei Kuryakov really wanted to know the truth,” she wrote to me in an e-mail. “But now I doubt it. I don’t believe in an avalanche.” After the Swiss report came out, she published an article rejecting it as well. “These theoreticians’ conclusions are supported by mathematical calculations, formulas, and diagrams, but the local Mansi, numerous tourists, and organizers of snowmobile tours, who have never seen avalanches on this slope, are unlikely to agree with them.”</p><p>A month after the press conference, Kuryakov was reprimanded for holding it without authorization, and in October he was removed from his post. (The prosecutor’s office has claimed that he resigned, and he did not respond to requests for an interview.) Early this year, he was appointed a deputy minister of natural resources in the Sverdlovsk region, which is a major timber producer. As Kuntsevich wrote to me sarcastically, Kuryakov was shunted off to “felling trees.” Meanwhile, the Prosecutor General declined to be interviewed for this article, and his office has issued no official report. Kuntsevich believes that a report may never be released, even to the families. The foundation is now calling for yet another investigation. Any clarity that Kuryakov’s solution might have brought was quickly occluded amid an atmosphere of murk and mistrust.</p><p>The most appealing aspect of Kuryakov’s scenario is that the Dyatlov party’s actions no longer seem irrational. The snow slab, according to Greene, would probably have made loud cracks and rumbles as it fell across the tent, making an avalanche seem imminent. Kuryakov noted that although the skiers made an error in the placement of their tent, everything they did subsequently was textbook: they conducted an emergency evacuation to ground that would be safe from an avalanche, they took shelter in the woods, they started a fire, they dug a snow cave. Had they been less experienced, they might have remained near the tent, dug it out, and survived. But avalanches are by far the biggest risk in the mountains in winter, and the more experience you have, the more you fear them. The skiers’ expertise doomed them.</p><p>At the end of 1958, as the date of departure approached, Krivonishchenko wrote a letter to Dyatlov firming up various logistical matters, and he enclosed a poem addressing New Year’s greetings to the entire group:</p><blockquote><p>Here’s wishing you<br>Camps pitched on mounts afar,<br>Routes to hike over ranges untamed,</p><p>Packs that, as ever, rest lightly on your backs,<br>And weather that smiles upon your quest. . . .<br>And let your footprints<br>Trace winding tracks across the map of Russia.</p></blockquote><p>Today, the Dyatlov Pass is a popular hiking and tourist destination. Hundreds have visited Height 1079, and followed Dyatlov’s route on foot, snowmobile, or skis. People come from all over the world to see the place where the tent once stood, the streambed where bodies were found, and the cedar tree, its broken branches still visible. Others come to take measurements, photographs, and videos to support their pet theories. The windswept heights of Dead Mountain have become a site of pilgrimage. Long after their deaths, Dyatlov and his friends did indeed leave their footprints across the map of Russia.</p>]]></content>

Technology, meanwhile, is remaking the economy.</p><p>For the young graduates going after a career in tech rather than pursuing a more traditional path, there’s scarcely been a better time in terms of the potential monetary reward. Joining a young startup could be a ticket to the next Snowflake Inc., Roblox Corp. or Airbnb Inc. — to name a few of the newly-public companies worth tens of billions. And after a series of major technological advancements over the last several months, there’s also a chance to realize that time-honored tech industry cliche: changing the world for the better.</p><p>Take tech companies’ role during the pandemic: E-commerce and food-delivery apps allowed vulnerable people to avoid infection. Videoconferencing and workplace collaboration apps enabled remote work and online schooling, while streaming services and videogames provided in-home entertainment. Most importantly, the rapid development of effective Covid-19 vaccines using new technology like mRNA saved lives and put us on the path to recovery.</p><p>All that’s laid the foundation for further progress. The focus on building digital services to cope with Covid-19 has led to significant advances in key technologies — such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and semiconductors — that will enable the next wave of innovation. And the maturation of free open-source software tools is a boon for startups looking to develop products rapidly at a lower expense.</p><p>Investors are stepping up as well. According to Crunchbase, nearly $73 billion was invested in growth-stage North American startups during the March quarter, double the prior year. Simply put, there may never have been an easier or more fortuitous time to start a new technology company.</p><p>The tech industry is also going after thorny problems. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp. bet $20 billion on the potential for artificial intelligence to dramatically improve the workplace with its purchase of Nuance Communications Inc. The software giant is looking to apply the voice-recognition pioneer’s early success in using AI to unburden doctors from tedious administrative paperwork to other industries beyond health care. Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. raised $1 billion in fresh capital that may bring about something straight out of science fiction novels. The game publisher said the funds will go toward its goal of building the “Metaverse,” where people can play and socialize with one another in virtual worlds. And on Monday, Apple Inc. said it plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on the development of advanced semiconductors and 5G wireless technologies over the next five years.</p><p>Technological progress can have its downsides. There have been ethical hurdles with the use of facial recognition against minority groups, along with negative effects from algorithms that amplify polarizing content on social media. And not all these companies will succeed in their lofty aspirations. But I’m optimistic there will be breakthroughs, and that the potential contributions to society outweigh the costs. With the increasing inflow of talent and large amounts of capital going after such exciting ideas, we may be on the brink of a golden age for innovation. If even just a handful of these new ideas succeed, the future could be brighter than even Elon Musk’s brightest dreams.</p><p><a id="how-i-learned-to-cycle-like-a-dutchman"></a></p><h1 id="How-I-Learned-to-Cycle-Like-a-Dutchman"><a href="#How-I-Learned-to-Cycle-Like-a-Dutchman" class="headerlink" title="How I Learned to Cycle Like a Dutchman"></a>How I Learned to Cycle Like a Dutchman</h1><p>来源: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/how-i-learned-to-cycle-like-a-dutchman?utm_campaign=falcon&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_brand=tny">https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/how-i-learned-to-cycle-like-a-dutchman?utm_campaign=falcon&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_brand=tny</a></p><p>“where are our helmets?” my daughter Harper asked. We were standing outside a cycle shop in the Dutch city of Delft, along with Harper’s older sister, Lyra, and my wife, Alia.</p><p>“We didn’t buy any,” I replied. Along the dark green Wijnhaven canal, confident Dutchmen and Dutchwomen whizzed around, their blond heads exposed to the soft northern sun. “In the Netherlands, only tourists wear helmets.”</p><p>“What if we get in a crash?” Lyra asked.</p><p>“We won’t,” I said. “O.K., now, let’s line up—oop!” A Dutchman in a sleek blue suit, riding a sleek blue bike, was swerving around me from the south. Another rider, approaching from the north, rang her bell to remind me that I was blocking traffic. “Everyone, get on,” I commanded, but nobody did. Small traffic jams were developing on either side of our uncertain foursome. “Let’s maybe walk our bikes to a less busy street,” I said. We wheeled our way across a bridge into the Markt square, where the primary obstacle was an Italian tour group.</p><p>It was April of 2017. We were to live in Delft for three months, and our canalside apartment, on a street named Hippolytusbuurt, was within riding distance of the grocery, the bakery, the girls’ school, the library, the ikea. Back home, in Virginia, our lives had been a blur of traffic, from drop-offs at soccer practice to hectic commutes. While our family was in Holland, Alia and I decided, we would take a break from driving cars. Cycling was the norm in the Netherlands, and fulfilled the dream of every American rider who wished she could rule the road. It was a country with more bikes than people, and we were eager to slip into the two-wheeled flow.</p><p>At the cycle shop, we’d bought used bikes for the adults and new but cheap ones for the kids. In the Dutch style, they weren’t mountain or racing bikes but city cruisers, meant to be ridden perfectly upright, your back as straight as a marching soldier’s. An employee had attached brightly colored milk crates to the back of each bike, so that we could carry baguettes, or whatever. I secured an agreement from the manager that he would buy back the bikes upon our departure, that July. I’d have been satisfied with a handshake, but the manager, being Dutch, had drafted a three-sentence contract, which we both signed in duplicate.</p><p>Alia took out her phone, opened Google Maps, and pointed to a lake just east of the city. “I thought we could ride out here and see what we see,” she said.</p><p>“Can we get a snack?” Harper asked.</p><p>“I am sure we will get a snack.”</p><p>And so we set off, with varying levels of feigned confidence, down the brick streets of Delft, the uneven surface making our wheels jostle. Every few turns of the pedals, I’d ride past a single brick that was painted the elegant blue-and-white of Delftware. As we crossed a canal on a high stone bridge, four boys zoomed past, each with a girlfriend perched sidesaddle atop his back wheel; they were followed, like a punch line, by a girl, pedalling hard, with a boyfriend sitting pertly atop hers.</p><p>We rode past the Oude Kerk, whose steeple, from the fourteenth century, leans at a pitch greater than that of Pisa’s tower. To our right was a wall of narrow three- and four-story apartment buildings, each with a business on the ground floor. To our left was the seven-hundred-year-old Oude Delft canal, its still surface covered with lily pads and floating trash. There was no protective guardrail or fence, not even a curb—just an unnerving, cliff-like drop. I kept imagining myself zooming off the edge, “Thelma &amp; Louise”–style, and into the dark water.</p><p>Alia led the way, with Lyra, then eleven, and Harper, then nine, in the middle, and me covering our rear. “Try to stay to the right,” I called ahead, as faster bikers passed on our left. When a hatchback zipped past us, mere inches from our bikes, Lyra shouted, “That car almost hit me!” After another car came uncomfortably close, she cried, “I don’t like this! Why aren’t we wearing helmets?”</p><p>There’s a gesture I make when I’m biking in the United States that, to me, encapsulates the status cyclists have in this country. Whenever I reach an intersection with a car approaching, I slow down to make sure I won’t be hit, and, even when I have the legal right of way—on a bike path, or when the car has a yield sign—I acknowledge a driver’s stopping with a little half-wave. Thank you for obeying the law and not killing me, I am saying.</p><p>Even in optimistic American municipalities that have demarcated bike lanes on the street or paved a few bike paths, cars come first, and drivers rarely look out for cyclists. Drivers park and then swing their front doors wide; they make right turns without looking behind them; they pull out of parking lots and cut across bike lanes at full speed. Who can blame them? The system was built to maximize drivers’ efficiency, and anything that might slow them down is a glitch.</p><p>For cyclists used to being second-class citizens, watching bikes navigate the Netherlands is revelatory. It’s not just that Dutch train stations all house massive underground bicycle garages, with thousands of bicycles, or fietsen, locked up on tiered racks. It’s not just that every busy street has a handsome bike lane, paved in dark-red brick. It’s that on Dutch streets, bikes rule the road. They take priority in design and traffic flow. Traffic circles are laid out so that cyclists need never stop for cars. Busy intersections often have overpasses or underpasses, so that cyclists never have to slow down.</p><p>Most important, drivers look out for cyclists, cede the right of way, and are rarely surprised by them. After all, nearly all those drivers are cyclists themselves. The eighteen million residents of the Netherlands own, in total, more than twenty-two million bicycles. Dutch kids ride in child seats practically from birth, are on balance bikes by two, and are cycling unaided by four. Old people continue to cycle, too: when pedalling gets too difficult, they switch to battery-assisted e-bikes, which now outsell standard adult bikes in the Netherlands.</p><p>When you’re biking on a Dutch street, the person next to you in a Renault Clio is driving today only because she broke her arm or has to cart furniture home from the store. Most days, she’d be biking next to you, unprotected from cars except by custom, respect, and the forethought that comes from being able to think like a cyclist. In the Netherlands, drivers don’t turn right without checking their blind spots. They don’t park in bike lanes, not even just for a minute, to drop something off. And no Dutch cyclist ever half-waves at a driver for making a required stop—they assume that drivers will see them and obey the law.</p><p>Even if something goes wrong, a biker will still likely emerge unscathed. Dutch transportation designers strive to create what Wim Bot, an official in the Dutch cyclist’s union, calls “forgiving infrastructure”—systems that allow users to make errors without causing a crash. Studies have demonstrated that when a car hits a cyclist at speeds in excess of thirty kilometres per hour the cyclist is not likely to survive. Therefore, Bot told me, “thirty kilometres is the maximum speed in every living area in the Netherlands.” This consistent speed limit means that “it’s safe to have shared space between users of different forms of mobility.” Even though nobody wears bike helmets in the Netherlands, the fatality rate there is six times smaller than that of the United States.</p><p>I learned these statistics soon after arriving in Delft, but I couldn’t quite make myself believe them. I kept stopping for cars and, yes, half-waving at intersections, even as the gesture began to feel obsequious. I couldn’t shake my American cycling deference. Meanwhile, impatient Dutch riders stacked up behind me, screeching to a halt on their worn brakes when I slowed unexpectedly—and, in their view, unnecessarily. Once, as I cautiously picked my way through a roundabout, I was passed on the left by an exasperated preschool teacher pedalling a kind of bike bus—eight kids lined up ahead of her, in rows of two. Their little unhelmeted heads turned to watch me as they went by.</p><p>On busy modern streets with bike lanes, my family’s tentativeness was annoying but not catastrophic. But in the old city center, with its narrow brick streets, steep canal bridges, and crowds of pedestrians, we kept causing accidents. The girls failed to get out of the way of an oncoming university student, sending him, careening and cursing, into an alley. In front of our apartment, Lyra mounted her bike, wobbled, and collided with another cyclist, an elderly Dutchman. They both toppled slowly onto the bricks. Lyra looked outraged at first, then terrified when she saw how old the other party was, wool scarf and all. All four of us apologized over and over; the gentleman silently helped Lyra up, brushed himself off, and rode away.</p><p>But we kept at it. Harper and Lyra rode to school every day, three and a half kilometres each way. The first time that they had to make the journey on a cold, wet morning, their faces sagged when we held out their raincoats. It wasn’t as if we were punishing them or anything; we didn’t have a car! When they begged us to bike with them, Alia asked, “Why would we do that? We don’t want to get wet.”</p><p>“We don’t, either,” the girls protested.</p><p>“Oh, well!” Alia said, brightly.</p><p>After a few round trips, they mostly mastered their daily ride. But I struggled to navigate complicated traffic situations in the old city. Keeping track of all the other bikes, cars, mopeds, and pedestrians—all moving in different directions, at different speeds—seemed to exceed my processing power.</p><p>Why were the Dutch so much more comfortable on a street that I saw as filled with dangers? As with so many aspects of their society, it seemed to depend on subsuming the needs of the individual to the needs of the community. “If you are not able to anticipate what other people will do, you will have lots of small accidents, or near accidents,” Bot told me, in a café down the street from our apartment. “You must be communicating with your eyes to the other riders in the street. Your decisions must be based on what is best for the flow of traffic, not what is best for your trip in particular.”</p><p>Bot went on, “Think of it this way. Car drivers behave like a bunch of geese. They have the same distance from each other and fly at the same speed, and move almost in military formation.” He put down his tea and made a series of regimented gestures with his hands. Then he moved them around together, in an elegant dance. “Cyclists move like a swarm of sparrows,” he said. “There are thousands of them moving in chaos, but there are no collisions. They turn a little bit; they change their speed. You must do the same.”</p><p>Angela van der Kloof, a cycling expert and project leader with the Delft mobility consultancy Mobycon, told me, “From a young age in the Netherlands, we’re trained to take note of others. Not by a teacher but by the way we do things. I think we are very much used to physical negotiation.” Dutch people live in small houses, ride on crowded trains, and generally jostle against one another—the Netherlands has the sixteenth-highest population density in the world. Navigating complicated traffic situations, calmly and systematically, came naturally to our neighbors.</p><p>I had assumed that Dutch people’s adeptness at biking was the result of generations of incessant cycling. In fact, after the Second World War, the Netherlands had, like the U.S., become dominated by cars. Cycling paths were overtaken by roads, and neighborhoods in Amsterdam were razed to make room for highways. Between 1950 and 1970, the number of cars in the country exploded from about a hundred thousand to nearly two and a half million. During that same period, bike use plummeted; in Amsterdam, the percentage of trips made by bike fell from eighty to twenty.</p><p>With cars came carnage. In 1971 alone, thirty-three hundred people—including more than four hundred children—were killed on Dutch roads. A number of organizations, including a group named Stop de Kindermoord, or Stop the Child Murder, began agitating to take the streets back from automobiles. In one memorable protest, sixty riders on Dutch cargo bikes, or bakfiets, converged on Amsterdam’s city center at rush hour and pedalled as slowly as possible, in order to drive drivers crazy. As Pete Jordan chronicles in his book “In the City of Bikes,” from 2013, two drivers intentionally struck protesters with their cars, and fights broke out. “To contain the conflict, riot police arrived in armored vans, and regular police arrived on motorcycles with sidecars,” he writes. “The demonstrators actually welcomed the presence of the police, since the additional vehicles helped to ensnarl traffic.”</p><p>While some of the activist organizations were led by young men, Stop de Kindermoord was the project of mothers, many of whom wished to use cycles in their daily life but felt that car traffic made doing so unsafe. “Women’s mobility and men’s mobility typically are different,” van der Kloof, the cycling expert, said. “Women have shorter trips, multiple trips, oftentimes accompanied by children. That’s why I think especially women were so interested in this.” As groups such as Stop de Kindermoord gained in prominence, local municipalities began experimenting with restricting cars on certain days or in certain areas. In the late seventies, the global energy crisis offered further justification for emphasizing cycling over driving.</p><p>Cycling activists successfully ran for office, and citizens pressured officials in Dutch cities to scrap plans for expanding automobile access. In Delft, a major bridge into town from the south had been built, and planners had approved the construction of a multilane road that would carve through the old city, all the way to the Markt square. “Just in time, those plans were abandoned,” Wim Bot said. Only the bridge remains. Instead, Delft was made more inhospitable to cars; these days, a driver can battle his way toward the center of the old city, creeping through narrow one-way streets and swarms of cyclists and pedestrians. But it is impossible to drive all the way from one side of Delft to the other: to cross the city, you must ride.</p><p>I did my best. I couldn’t be lean and blond, but I could bike as if I were. I could ride tall in the saddle, with the self-possession of a Dutchman with sharp, visible cheekbones. “The road was built for me, too,” I told myself, repeating it like a mantra.</p><p>After I picked a vector and owned it, made strong directional choices at intersections, and stopped riding in fear, I fit into the flow of Dutch traffic much better. Making eye contact with other riders and pedestrians, each of us using the other’s feedback to negotiate those individual interactions, solved encounters that previously would have paralyzed me.</p><p>I also stopped slowing down when cars approached, although I never quite got over the fear that this oncoming driver would be the one who didn’t see me. My mantra faltered. “In North America, if you want to bike, it’s like playing tennis,” van der Kloof mused. “You need a racquet, a ball, the right clothing, and a tennis court. Talking about biking, you need a bike, you need the right gear, and you need a bike lane.” But, as a Dutch person, she continued, she had never questioned her right to claim her share of public space. “In the Netherlands, we think of it as our space,” she said.</p><p>By the end of our stay in Holland, cycling had become something we did with the ease I’d dreamed of. Once, in a light rain, I biked ten kilometres to the Hague, with my phone strapped to my handlebars displaying Google Maps and five thousand dollars’ worth of my employer’s computer equipment in my basket. In a country where I’d once seen a guy riding one-handed while carrying a used television set in the other hand, I felt, at this moment, like I fit in.</p><p>Since returning home, I’ve made a conscious decision to ride differently on American streets. I pedal like a Dutchman: confidently, with no helmet, and taking up my fair share of the street. I’ve spent many an afternoon trundling along the quieter parts of my suburban neighborhood, a couple of cars lining up behind me as I approach an intersection. I enjoy playing big on the road, and making drivers recognize that I belong in that space just as much as they do. (If I’m lucky, none of them will hit me.)</p><p>I think a lot about the ride that I took with the girls to their school in Delft, on the last day before summer break. We biked out of the old city, past the train station and through the most magnificent traffic circle I’ve ever seen: a gigantic roundabout, at the Delflandplein, that capably handles bicycles, cars, express buses, and the tram to The Hague. It’s a masterpiece of boring urban design. Even though thousands of cars and bikes pass through the roundabout every day, there were zero crashes reported there between 2014 and 2017.</p><p>It was a beautiful, warm day, and we cruised confidently through the circle, my children in the lead. We had the right of way around the circle’s entire circumference. Cars waited patiently, reminded to be cautious by little painted triangles on the pavement and by their own roles as cyclists. As we completed the arc, we felt fleetingly assimilated—part of a smoothly operating machine that offers safety and satisfaction to each one of its cogs. We were fietsers.</p>]]></content>

Beside him is a white-jacketed waiter, holding a bottle of red wine. The man tastes a little of the wine and nods. The waiter starts to pour and fails to stop. The wine brims over the top of the glass, like water in a fountain, and spreads across the tablecloth. The waiter mops at the spill with his napkin, to no avail. He could be a murderer, trying to wipe away his crime. Not a word is spoken. In voice-over, though, a nameless woman says, “I saw a man with his mind elsewhere.”</p><p> voice-over:画外音 mind elsewhere：心不在焉</p><p>That is a scene from “About Endlessness,” the latest—and, according to a rumor that one hopes will prove unfounded, the final—film from the Swedish director Roy Andersson. By my count, there are thirty-three such scenes; what worked for Beethoven, in the Diabelli Variations, is good enough for Andersson. He has referred to the movie as “a collection of short, short poems about existence,” like an eager bardic youth pressing his first, slim volume upon us, and “About Endlessness,” defying its own title, clocks in at a sprightly seventy-six minutes. Yet Andersson himself is now seventy-eight, and most of his characters proceed with painful caution, as if they were approaching a dental appointment or walking a pirate’s plank. Many of them prefer to stay still, waiting for God knows what.</p><p>Things were not always thus in Andersson’s created world. His début feature, “A Swedish Love Story” (1970), tracing the progress of an adolescent relationship, was governed by a modest social realism. Its charm brought the director a measure of success, which he then erased with the wholesale failure of “Giliap” (1975). At this point, he paused for thought, and his next full-length movie, “Songs from the Second Floor,” did not appear until the turn of the millennium. That’s a hell of a pause.</p><p>Andersson was far from idle during the hiatus. He made hundreds of commercials, which were lauded by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-immortal-world-of-ingmar-bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, no less, and which demonstrated the refining of an austerely funny style. Given Andersson’s predilection for misadventure, it’s no surprise that he was hired to promote an insurance company. His presence can be felt in stories that take twenty seconds to tell. When a green car, for example, stops at the side of a road, and the driver gets out, walking around to the hood but leaving his door open, it is only natural that a passing truck will shear the door off, like a falcon ripping the wing from a dove. Note, again, the lack of speech; neither shouting nor cursing, the innocent man merely stares at the small disaster as if he had seen it coming. Note, too, the unexplained set of antlers strapped to the roof of his car. As the silent comedians knew, and as insurance agents tend to forget, experience can overshoot the strange.</p><p>Andersson returned to feature films in rigorous command of his art. Since then, each of his movies has been made up of miniature fables, some of them as curt as commercials. His angle of vision has been singular and fixed—literally so, with a camera that refuses to budge. Most of his characters are played by ordinary folk whom Andersson spotted around town and invited to perform, however fleetingly, onscreen. Many of them have whitened faces, as if they’d been dusted with flour. Are we meant to think of Marcel Marceau, perhaps, or of Harry Langdon, whose milky and babyish features made him a star of the nineteen-twenties? Or could the dust be ash, akin to the penitential mark that some Christians wear on their brows on Ash Wednesday? The prevailing air is one of befuddled sorriness, and the epigraph to “Songs from the Second Floor” is a line from the Peruvian poet César Vallejo: “Beloved be the ones who sit down.” Only Andersson, the doyen of inaction movies, could offer beatitudes to the ineffectual and the zonked.</p><p>“Songs from the Second Floor,” “You, the Living” (2007), and “A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence” (2014) are informally known as the “Living” trilogy—as opposed to the Corleone saga, say, which is known as the “Shooting, Garroting, and Poisoned Cannoli” trilogy. To some extent, “About Endlessness” departs from the trilogy, not least in the voice-over, which, as if rebuffing the rhapsodies in the Book of Revelation (“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth”), remarks without judgment on cruelty and tedium alike: “I saw a man begging for his life,” or, “I saw a woman who had problems with her shoe.”</p><p>In other respects, the new film keeps up the sad work. As before, we get a sequence of tableaux vivants in lieu of a plot. Inspect them closely, and loose links emerge. A man who gets blanked in broad daylight by an old schoolmate, near the start of the movie, returns more than an hour later, standing in his kitchen and <em>still</em> griping about the guy. We also have a recurring guest appearance by a priest, who has mislaid his faith. He is seen dragging a huge cross along a street, to shouts of “Crucify!” from a jeering mob; swigging Communion wine in the vestry while his parishioners kneel at the altar rail; and confessing to a doctor that he doubts the existence of God. “What’s there to believe in, then?” the priest asks. The doctor’s reply is unimprovable. “Damned if I know,” he says.</p><p>There is a fine documentary about Andersson, titled “Being a Human Person” (2020). It is directed by Fred Scott, and centers on the making of “About Endlessness.” Here we see Andersson as the lord of his domain—his production studios, on an unassuming street in Stockholm. The figure he cuts is that of a homely Dumbledore, mostly in jeans and checked shirt, moving gingerly, patiently deploying his magic, and frequently melting into laughter. At one point, production lurches to a halt as Andersson enters rehab. (Behind him, in the words of a loyal colleague, lie “thirty years of heavy drinking.”) Flashbacks to his earlier self show a lithe young fellow whom we barely recognize.</p><p>For the crafting of every tableau, within the studios, a set is designed, constructed, and, after use, destroyed. No external filming takes place; even the grandest episodes, such as a defeated army trudging across a snowscape, are fashioned indoors. Panels of board, bearing architectural details, are hung between the camera and the backdrop in order to feed the illusion of deep perspective. You may not realize, as a woman alights from a train—gazing around her, expecting to be greeted—that the train is not the real thing, pulling out of a real station, but a model, drawn along the tracks by a length of twine, which is wrapped around the spinning bit of a regular household drill. Simple.</p><p>Not that Andersson is averse to digital sleights of hand. Twice in the new movie, we watch a couple floating through the sky and clutching each other tight. As Scott’s documentary makes plain, they were filmed against a green screen. No less important than the technical trick, though, is the echo of Chagall—specifically, of his painting “Over the Town,” in which he and his wife, likewise, are aloft. The difference is that, whereas Chagall soars over Vitebsk, precisely recalled from his childhood, what lies beneath the drifters in “About Endlessness” is the city of Cologne, ravaged by wartime bombing. Moreover, while the painting glows with accents of blue, green, and red, Andersson’s palette, as so often, is limited to washed-out duns and grays.</p><p>Is there a downside to this visual manner, forthright and coherent as it is? At the risk of heresy, I’d suggest that the light with which so much of Andersson’s work is suffused—pale, sifted, and flattening—can sometimes verge on monotony and sink the soul. (Compare the sharp and crystalline atmosphere that Bergman, his fellow-Swede, conjured up when he ventured out of doors, especially in his bracing early films.) The constant near-avoidance of despair is a delicate trade, and Andersson’s sense of direction is not unerring. I wasn’t entirely swayed by the sudden arrival of Adolf Hitler in “About Endlessness,” even if the Führer is at his wits’ end, or, in Andersson’s previous film, by the running gag about two salesmen, one of them permanently on the brink of tears, who were dead set on hawking joke toys—vampire teeth, “laugh bags,” and so on. In truth, the mixing of the mournful and the clownish is a stale trope. Didn’t <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/charlie-chaplins-scandalous-life-and-boundless-artistry">Chaplin</a>’s “Limelight” (1952) lay it to rest?</p><p>Yet Andersson has earned our lasting gratitude. Few living directors beget work that carries so clear and so immediate a signature. There is nothing unfinished about his fragments, and no one else could have summoned the precarious beauty of the moment, in “About Endlessness,” at which the patrons of a bar regard the snow falling softly outside, to the sound of “Silent Night,” and one of them exclaims, in lonely joy, “Isn’t it fantastic?” Indeed. You could argue that a little of this goes a long way, but that’s the point. An Andersson movie is a gallery of littles, each of them going a very long way. The new film ends with another green car by the roadside—broken down, in the middle of nowhere. Once more, the driver doesn’t complain; why rage against the gods? Instead, in his abandonment, he listens to the birdsong all around. Overhead, into the painted yonder, a skein of geese glides by. Hopelessness, like endlessness, can be the bringer of peace.</p><p><a id="acts-of-kindness-prevent-a-downward-spiral-from-solitude-to-loneliness"></a></p><h1 id="Acts-of-kindness-prevent-a-downward-spiral-from-solitude-to-loneliness"><a href="#Acts-of-kindness-prevent-a-downward-spiral-from-solitude-to-loneliness" class="headerlink" title="Acts of kindness prevent a downward spiral from solitude to loneliness"></a>Acts of kindness prevent a downward spiral from solitude to loneliness</h1><p>LONELINESS IS BAD for your health—certainly as bad as being obese, and possibly as bad as being a moderate smoker. So, in these days of plague, when enforced solitude is the order of the day in many places, how to stop solitude turning into loneliness is a pressing medical question.</p><p>One part of the answer is to try to understand the physiology of the change. And that has, for the past few years, been the objective of Steven Cole of the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr Cole began his work with a study he published in 2015, in collaboration with John Cacioppo of the University of Chicago. The pair led a team of psychologists, neuroscientists and immunologists who found that the pattern in people’s blood of immune cells called myeloid cells is notably different in those who score as “very lonely” on loneliness tests compared with those who do not.</p><p>Lonely people have unusually low numbers of a type of myeloid cell that generates what are known as interferon responses, which hamper viral replication. This makes them particularly vulnerable to viral infections. They also have an abundance of a second type of myeloid cell, one that promotes the activity of genes which drive inflammation—and it has been known for years that those who feel lonely experience more inflammation than those who do not.</p><p>These correlations are intriguing, but do not explain which comes first, the loneliness or the myeloid response. Dr Cole and Dr Cacioppo addressed that question by repeatedly measuring perceptions of social isolation in individual volunteers, while simultaneously tracking, from blood samples, their gene-expression patterns and other changes in their physiology. They found that, initially, volunteers’ feelings of isolation coincided with an increase in their inflammation genes’ activity and a concomitant increase in the circulation of immature immune cells, called monocytes, that are involved in inflammation—and which are also known to travel into the brain and promote anxiety. They noted, too, increased levels in the brain of signalling molecules associated with both inflammation and behaviours such as social withdrawal, feelings of suspicion towards the outside world and a tendency to act more defensively by making decisions that involve few risks. That, of course, promotes further feelings of loneliness. Which, in turn, trigger a further myeloid response. And so on.</p><p>It seems, therefore, that though loneliness starts with solitude, it can quickly take on a physiological life of its own. Dr Cole thus worries that the enforced isolation, brought about by current circumstances, of those who are already living alone may create in many people a state of chronic loneliness that is difficult to escape from when things start returning to normal.</p><p>Dealing with this will not be a simple matter of allowing people to socialise once again. Because the myeloid feedback loop makes those affected more defensive and suspicious, the mere presence of others is not enough to restore the status quo. Something else is needed, too.</p><p>In search of that something Dr Cole carried out—this time in collaboration with Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist at the University of California, Riverside—a series of experiments that encouraged healthy people to direct simple acts of kindness towards their fellow creatures: things like running an errand for an elderly neighbour or helping a colleague with a computer problem. Participants had their blood drawn in order to examine their myeloid responses. Those directed to show kindness to others on a weekly basis had precisely the opposite gene-expression activity to that previously seen in the lonely by Dr Cole and Dr Cacioppo.</p><p>Dr Lyubomirsky now picked up the baton. In collaboration with Dr Cole and with Megan Fritz, a colleague at Riverside, she repeated the study, but with a twist. Instead of looking only at participants’ myeloid responses, she also asked them specific questions about loneliness.</p><p>As she and her colleagues reported to this year’s conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, held in New Orleans in February, they found that in the case of loneliness, the saying about it being more blessed to give than to receive is true. Asking lonely people to perform acts of kindness to others significantly reduced the offerer’s feelings of loneliness, as well as the myeloid response that drives inflammation. Also, and perhaps portentously given the meeting’s timing, Dr Fritz and Dr Lyubomirsky reported the preliminary results of a second study. This compared the effect on a lonely person’s feelings of acts of kindness he or she performed face to face with those performed online: donating money to a gofundme effort, for example, or writing a thank-you note to a friend.</p><p>The study’s results suggest that online kindness has the same beneficial effect as the face-to-face variety. And that could help to address Dr Cole’s fears of a post-covid loneliness epidemic. No doubt (though this was beyond the scope of these studies) merely having contact with others while staying in isolation is beneficial to those at risk of loneliness. But asking lonely people to use those means to commit random acts of kindness to others might go beyond this, and be just what the doctor ordered.</p><p><a id="can-we-escape-from-information-overload"></a></p><h1 id="Can-we-escape-from-information-overload"><a href="#Can-we-escape-from-information-overload" class="headerlink" title="Can we escape from information overload?"></a>Can we escape from information overload?</h1><p>We live in an age of infinite scrolling and endless interruptions. So what happens when you switch off the lights? Tom Lamont finds out One day in December 2016 a 37-year-old British artist named Sam Winston equipped himself with a step-ladder, a pair of scissors, several rolls of black-out cloth and a huge supply of duct tape, and set about a project he had been considering for some time. Slight and bearded, with large grey-blue eyes, Winston had moved to London from Devon in the late 1990s. He supported himself through his 20s and 30s by teaching, doing illustrations for magazines and selling larger, freer-form artworks, many of them pencil-drawn, to collectors and museums. He had just collaborated on a children’s book with author Oliver Jeffers, and done his part to propel “Child of Books” up the bestseller lists. Grateful as he was for commercial success, Winston found he disliked corporate publishing. All the emails! He saw himself as a lead-smudged idealist, an artist-hermit at heart. He’d been troubled by nervous energy and stress since he was young, was an intermittent insomniac, had difficulty filtering noise and distractions in public spaces, and was someone who – like so many of us – increasingly relied on his phone and computer. So Winston decided to hole up for a few days. No screens. No sun. No visual stimulation of any kind. He was going to spend some time alone in the dark.</p><p>It took him hours, climbing up and down the ladder in his studio, to cover every last aperture and pinprick of inbound light. The studio, in a converted factory in east London, has large tenement windows and a sloped roof inlaid with skylights that were especially tricky to seal. By Winston’s conservative estimate he used 200 metres of duct tape before he was fully satisfied that here, at last, was darkness. He would sit in it, drawing with pencil and paper, doing yoga, snacking a bit, waiting to see if the dark had any sort of palliative effect.</p><p>The world in the 21st century is no more richly textured or exotic to touch than it used to be. It smells about the same and there are no new flavours. Not since the coming of factories, then aeroplanes, domestic appliances and motorways has there been a serious uptick in sound pollution. Yet the spill of information and distraction that comes at us by eye has grown and grown ceaselessly for two decades, without any sign of a halt or plateau. DM! Breaking-news! Inbox (1)! This is a time of the scrolling, bottomless visual, when bus stops and the curved walls of Tube platforms play video adverts and grandma’s face swims onto a smartphone to say hi. People watch Oscar-nominated movies while standing in queues, their devices held at waist height. A Netflix executive can quip, semi-seriously, that he covets the hours we sleep (hours in which we do not, currently, stream Netflix shows). Apple has put an extra screen on our wrists and Google retains quiet hope that we will eventually wear a screen inside our specs. Big news lands in 140 characters or less, ideally with a startling picture or piece of video, else it doesn’t register as big news.</p><p>Our brains tend to lean on the visual, heavily prioritising sight over the other four senses. Ever since we climbed on to two feet as a species, taking our noses farther from the aroma-rich savannah floor, we have been wired to be seeing creatures and for better or worse we usually experience the what’s-next-what’s-next of this world through our peepers. As an artist, Sam Winston was often on the lookout for topsy-turvy projects – weird, sidelong ways to unmoor familiar habits or nudge his work in new directions. He wanted to know what would happen, to him and to his work, if he hid away from the ocular blitz for a while.</p><p>Now, working and sleeping in his blacked-out studio, he began to notice new things. Without sunlight as a guide, the day’s rhythms came via aural clues he had been only dimly aware of before: the cessation of London’s air traffic overnight, or the sound of idling vehicles as they took fractionally longer to move off from traffic lights during rush hour. When he brewed cups of rooibos in a rote-remembered action at his tea station he noticed that he could hear the difference between hot and cold liquids as he poured them. He began to see, he later told me, “how intelligent our senses are. And how we just drown them in the tsunami.”</p><p>Winston found that he was productive in the dark, too, drawing until his pencils were nubs and creating a series of huge sketches – broad-stroked in places or crowded with overlapping sentences in his crabby handwriting – that would later become part of an exhibition at the Southbank Centre in London. Between drawing jags he had vivid daydreams, even hallucinations, “as if my brain was a digital radio left on search, constantly searching for an available channel”.</p><p>Winston’s older brother had died, suddenly, the year before, and bereavement was another prompt for him to hole away in the dark. He had expected to use his time under seal to have profound thoughts about love and loss, to feel gratitude towards his girlfriend, a fellow artist, and his parents back in Devon. Instead a very different figure stalked the darkened landscape of Winston’s mind – one who was suited, lardy and omnipresent in the news after his recent election as president of the United States. Winston considered himself only a moderate news junkie, bombarded but not an addict. Yet here was Donald Trump, cavorting around his studio. It was as if, Winston felt, the news was something he’d over-indulged in, even overdosed on, a damaging substance that only now, in cold-turkey conditions, could swirl up out of him and be evacuated.</p><p>Winston emerged from the blacked-out studio before his food stocks ran out, around lunchtime on a Saturday. He’d been in there for six or seven days. The sun hurt his eyes. For a long time Winston watched train after train go by on the tracks outside his studio, relishing the everyday sights he’d been starved of, and at the same time trying to settle his insides. What he presumed to be a sudden dump of daylight-induced hormones made him feel faint. The next time he retreated into the dark, Winston resolved, he would try to come out after sunset for a gentler transition. Intrigued by the experiment, and suspecting there were greater depths he could go to, he had already decided there would be a next time.</p><p>Through 2017 and 2018 he made plans. He Googled bits and pieces of research. A pioneering experiment on sensory deprivation had been done at the University of Manitoba in Canada in the 1950s, during which hundreds of people were asked to remain alone in a sealed dark room for as long as they could bear. About a third of the subjects quit within days. At most they were in there a fortnight. If he went into the dark again, Winston wondered, could he manage a month? He Googled some more, and went shopping online, ordering more black-out cloth, more duct tape.</p><p>Information overload was a term coined in the mid-1960s by Bertram Gross, an American social scientist. In 1970 a writer called Alvin Toffler, who was known at the time as a dependable futurist – someone who prognosticated for a living – popularised the idea of information overload as part of a set of bleak predictions about eventual human dependence on technology. (Good call, Alvin.) Information overload can occur in man or machine, wrote another set of academics in a 1977 study, “when the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity”. Then came VHS, home computers, the internet, mobile phones, mobile-phones-with-the-internet – and waves of anxiety that we might be reaching the limits of our capacity.</p><p>A study in 2011 found that on a typical day Americans were taking in five times as much information as they had done 25 years earlier – and this was before most people had bought smartphones. In 2019 a study by academics in Germany, Ireland and Denmark identified that humans’ attention span is shrinking, probably because of digital intrusion, but was manifesting itself both “online and offline”.</p><p>By that time an organisation called the Information Overload Research Group had done a study which estimated that hundreds of billions of dollars were being shucked away from the American economy every year, in miscellaneous productivity costs, by an overload of data. The group had been co-founded in 2007 by a computer engineer-turned-consultant, Nathan Zeldes, who had once been asked by Intel, a computer-chip maker, to reduce the burden of email imposed on its workers. By the end of 2019 Zeldes was ready to sound a note of defeat. “I’d love to give you a magic potion that would restore your attention span to that of your grandparents,” he wrote in a blog, “but I can’t. After over a decade of smartphone use and social media, the harm is probably irreversible.” He advised people to take up a hobby.</p><p>In an age of overload it can feel as though technology has rather chanced its luck. Pushed too much, too far, bone-deep. Even before coronavirus spread across the world, parts of the culture had started to tack towards isolation and deprivation as desirable lifestyle signifiers, hot-this-year, as if some time spent alone and without a device was the new season’s outfit, the next Cronut, another twerk.</p><p>Before a pandemic limited the appeal of wallowing in someone else’s tepid water, flotation-tank centres were opening all over London. In the Czech Republic there are spas that sell clients a week in the dark in shuttered, serviced suites. “Social distancing is underrated,” Edward Snowden tweeted, deadpan, in March 2020: a corona-joke, but one that will have spoken to the tech bros of Silicon Valley, for whom retreats were the treat of choice.</p><p>Recently, I saw that a person called Celine in San Francisco had tweeted to her 2,500-odd followers about the difficulty of “trying to date SF guys in between their week-long meditation retreats, Tahoe weekends, month-long remote work sessions…” About 4,000 people tapped to endorse the sentiment, launching Celine onto an exponential number of strangers’ screens, including my own. The default sound for any new tweet is a whistle, somewhere between a neighbourly “yoo-hoo” and a dog-walker’s call to heel.</p><p>Hilda Burke, a British psychotherapist who has written about smartphone addiction, told me that part of the problem in this age of overload is the yoo-hooing insistence with which each new parcel of information seeks our attention. Speakers chime. Pixelated columns shuffle urgently or icons bounce, as if to signal that here is the fire. Our twitch response to urgency is triggered, in bad faith.</p><p>When Celine’s tweet whistled onto my phone one idle Friday I couldn’t understand why I found it mildly stressful to read. Was it that it made me feel old? That I already had enough to think about? Eventually I realised that, for me, every tweet is a bit stressful. Every trifling, whistling update that comes at us, Burke said, “is like a sheep dressed in wolf’s clothing. The body springs to attention, ready to run or fight, and for nothing that’s worth it. This is confusing.”</p><p>In Sam Winston’s case the epiphany moment came when he realised just how much he was enjoying his hangovers after a night out. He lolled on the sofa. He didn’t feel “targeted by Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, all these services with algorithms that are intentionally designed to be as sexy and juicy and distracting as possible, to fire my synapses as often as they could. What’s that truism? ‘Protect me from what I want.’” He realised that he had a weird urge to be on something like a cruise ship for a month: “To experience a clear stop to it.”</p><p>During the summer of 2018 Winston worked to secure a location for his planned month in the dark. An acquaintance agreed to lend him a one-room guesthouse in the Lake District, asking only that, once the property had been thoroughly blacked-out with cloth and tape, Winston sign a waiver taking the blame for any catastrophe. He bought cupboard stores, frozen pies, an apocalypse-supply of bottled water. He arranged for a group of trusted people to call in by phone and make the occasional visit to check that, as one friend put it, “he wasn’t going full Norman Bates in there”.</p><p>Winston decided on a few more ground rules. He would do four weeks, going in on Monday at the start of October and coming out on a Sunday at the end. This would amount to 672 hours in seclusion. He would take voice notes on a Dictaphone and record less literal impressions in a series of pencil drawings.</p><p>In keeping with the maverick spirit of the effort he did not look deeply into the health risks. He did a bit of reading about melatonin and serotonin, hormones that are produced in the brain by the pea-sized pineal gland and which help the body to regulate its sleep-wake cycle. Winston figured he’d end up rather starved of serotonin, which is usually secreted during daylight hours and helps us to feel alert, but that he’d get an absolute bonanza of melatonin, a soporific. He didn’t consult a doctor, though he did quiz a Specsavers employee during a routine appointment. She said she didn’t know what to tell him.</p><p>Winston couldn’t resist a final tweet before he locked himself away: “No reception. No screen time. Drawing in darkness. See you in Nov.” On the last day of September he took a sunset walk in the fields surrounding the property, staring at hills and cows and in general trying to enjoy this last conventional use of his eyeballs. Then he went indoors and went to bed, killing the lights for the next 28 days.</p><p>He could handle the pitch-black mornings, having tried a shorter version of this experiment before. So when Winston awoke and got over the momentary panic – that, no, he had not lost his vision overnight – it was easy and agreeable to drift back into a dark-drugged second sleep. When he did get out of bed, feeling his way to the kitchenette and the fridge, breakfast took longer than usual to prepare and consume. All this contributed to a certain time-slippage. Even in those first few days he imagined he was up and under way on some morning activity, drawing at his work table, or doing yoga stretches on the carpet, only to receive a check-in call from his girlfriend, who let him know he was a few hours behind. Without a precise sense of time he surrendered again to the vaguer, lulling rhythms of something-like-morning, something-like-afternoon, something-like-evening, something-like-night.</p><p>It was quieter in the country guesthouse than it had been in the city studio. Winston’s ears had to tune in to more distant aural clues. Before long he realised he could tell the difference between day and night from the density of traffic noise on an A-road half a mile away. He went through other transitional stages he had experienced before, such as that weird prominence of news and current events as his psyche cleared its titbits and cookies, “the accumulated songs, the little thought eddies, a kaleidoscope of stuff”, as Winston remarked in a Dictaphone note on day five. A day later he recorded another note: “I’ve discovered it doesn’t matter which way you walk in the dark, forward or backwards, it makes no difference. Either way you can’t see anything. Quite good, walking backwards.”</p><p>With his vision suppressed, his other four senses were getting a chance to step up and show their stuff. It has long been accepted that people who can’t see may experience other sensory gains. With advancements in brain-scanning technology in the 1990s and 2000s, academics began to test our anecdotal understanding with empirical research. Their findings suggested that non-visual sensory enhancement happens quickly in the dark. Even 30 or 45 minutes after the lights plink off, our fingertips thrill with greater responsiveness and we seem to become markedly better at determining the direction of travel of sound. Research in this area is ongoing, and it excites scientists who specialise in the senses because it suggests the brain is more adaptable – more “plastic” in their terminology – than was previously thought.</p><p>Charles Spence of Oxford University’s department of experimental psychology talks about brain plasticity as if he’s a property magnate. “When the body is plunged into darkness”, he told me, “this huge visual part of the brain is no longer doing the stuff it normally does. That’s a lot of spare real estate and what you find is that, surprisingly quickly, the real estate is retooled or repurposed.” The other senses simply take it over. That the non-visual senses should commandeer brain space so quickly – within an hour, according to some studies – excites specialists such as Spence because it suggests that we are using latent connections instead of growing new ones, which would take longer to form. By turning off the lights, in other words, we aren’t necessarily enhancing the other senses, we’re just more inclined to heed what these other senses are already saying.</p><p>As he entered his second week in the dark, Winston spent ages running his fingers over common objects, the edges of things, surfaces, entertained and distracted by the minute textural details he could discern. He had been drawing in the dark. Now, whenever he picked up a pencil, he was sure he could intuit the density of a pencil’s lead from its vibrations on paper as well as “the acoustics of it, its energy across the page”. Certain tactile experiences came with exciting visual impressions. Washing was especially thrilling – “showers were Alton Towers” – as every drop of water seemed to conjure a corresponding drop of colour in Winston’s mind. When his girlfriend called him from a London bus, he found that he relished the humdrum noises in the background, the sound of commuters, the beeps. “It was like having a whole tv mini-series to think about afterwards.”</p><p>The refining of his other senses led to compromises and frustrations too. Winston could no longer get to sleep on sheets that had been washed in supermarket detergent because he found the fragrance so strong it made him gag. Foods he’d always liked turned disagreeable, particularly processed ones. There was an unforgettable afternoon with a McCoy. Winston was convinced he could now track the progress of the crisp’s saturated fat down his oesophagus. One day, troubled by indigestion, his brain conjured a frightening image of himself with a distended, bloated stomach. He started to eat less after that. Exercising, crying, masturbating less. As Winston prickled with a richer sort of sensory awareness, these basic physical activities wound down because he found them too dramatic, too weird, too much. He had come into the dark to escape, but this didn’t feel like much of one.</p><p>By the start of the third week, soggy with melatonin, Winston was spending more and more time on the sofa. He sunk in to memories. Daydreamed. Hallucinated. He saw landscapes drift past, mostly coastlines, shimmering seas. His hallucinations could be workaday and he found that his mind itched to redraw the guesthouse around him, plastered beige walls there, tiled kitchenette there…Then, after something as prosaic as that, he would see a cloud-filled sky. A star field.</p><p>If the bodily effects of the retreat were strange (psychedelic showers, the snake-like digestion of a crisp), then these were foothill experiences compared with the mental effects. In the aftermath Winston would have trouble putting the experiences into words and we would have long conversations trying to map where exactly he went in his head, trying to differentiate between day-time hallucinations and night-time dreams, sometimes falling back on the Dictaphone notes Winston had recorded in the dark.</p><p>He was amazed at the obscurity and reach of the memories that came to the fore, “these weird little air bubbles from the past that went ‘pop’.” As with Trump, the people who turned up to join him – sometimes hallucinated, sometimes felt only as spectral presences – were rarely those he expected. When he was 17, Winston had been a bit crap toward his first girlfriend. He hadn’t thought about her in decades and now she strode back in (hiya!) to join him in the black-out. It took Winston four or five days, wringing his hands, picking back through long-ago instances of infelicity, laziness, casual teenaged callousness, to retrieve a useful memory: she’d once written him a letter he hadn’t answered. “She was the first person who ever wrote to me and said, ‘I love you.’ And I turned around and said, ‘Whatevs, I’m over, doing this with somebody else.’ I missed it at the time, the intimacy and the tenderness of the moment. So there I am, 20 years later, in the dark – realising how incredibly selfish I’d been.”</p><p>The spectral girlfriend shimmered away. Afterwards, Winston found himself revisiting and replaying all kinds of bygone squabbles and misunderstandings. Pleasant moments too. He thought about his girlfriend a lot. He wondered why he had never asked her to marry him. He found he could wallow, a little more inquisitively, a little more sympathetically, in overwhelming emotional events that had rushed by at the time.</p><p>This was not always a good thing. Winston thought a lot about his brother, Ben, who had died. “Just fell over. He was 40. He had a wife and a young daughter. He was in the middle of his life. It wasn’t fucking fair.” When someone dies on you like that, Winston said, “there’s a rational bit of you that knows they’re dead. And there’s this irrational bit where you feel a bit like a bloodhound. You’re sniffing around going ‘Sorry, where have they gone?’” In the dark, with no morning or afternoon, the real and the imagined had vaguer edges and Winston started sniffing around more deliberately. “I had some experiences that were pretty far out to sea. A part of me thought, you know, ‘I’m gonna go and find Ben.’” This didn’t happen. There was no spiritual encounter, no satisfying reunion for Winston. Instead, during his scarier reveries on the guesthouse sofa, he started to doubt what he called “the binary here and not-here of death”. Winston even wondered once or twice if he’d died himself. He worried he might be going mad.</p><p>“When you turn off perception by going into darkness,” Charles Spence told me, “mental imagery has nothing to compete with. It becomes the most intense thing there is. Hence you start to see hallucinations, people confusing reality with their mental imagery, the mental image for the real.” A friend of Winston, Martin Aylward, who’d tried a week-long dark retreat himself, warned how noisy the experience could be. “Even if you spend a little time with yourself,” Aylward said, “you’ll notice how a voice chatters away in your head – the blah-blah-blah of the inner monologue. In the dark that can start to be extremely loud, extremely tiresome. And relentless.”</p><p>There had been moments, listening to Winston’s tales from the dark, that I wondered if we might all follow his lead and spend our own month under seal. In a fluorescent world, especially in these tense, locked-down times, mightn’t darkness be a sort of readily available cure-all? A potent, inexhaustible form of bedroom pharma?</p><p>Winston went into the dark for a month in a bid to escape the digital bell-chimes, the bouncing icons, the bulletins and info-blasts – our exhausting daily scroll. “But when you go into the dark for a long time,” Winston admitted to me, recently, “you’re not going into a void. You’re going into yourself. And good luck finding blissful empty quiet there.” There was nothing to compete with the loud, incessant inner monologue or drown it out. I wondered, then, whether we’d created and refined all our sparkly informational distractions because on some level we knew the relentlessness of the subconscious had the real power to overload.</p><p>By the start of the fourth week Winston had started to lose track of how much sleep he was getting. He was having dreams of such dazzling, 3D intensity that even months later it was hard for him to call them dreams. One morning towards the end, Winston woke up and recorded a raspy, panicked Dictaphone note: “Day 19… There was a bizarre little event. The Queen came to visit, and I was naked, and she was here already.” Around this time a friend drove to the guesthouse to look in on Winston. He answered the door in a blindfold, looking pale and gaunt. Talking slowly, maybe at two-thirds speed, he said he hadn’t been expecting anyone until the afternoon. “But it’s 5pm,” the friend said.</p><p>The real world, the one with garishly delineated mornings and afternoons, was creeping back to claim him. His girlfriend was due to arrive at the guesthouse a couple of days before the end, to help Winston adjust to human company again and ease the outward transition. He recorded a voice note: “So this is day, I think, 26? 27? She arrives in a couple of hours. Everything’s sped up. Everything’s got quite rush-y. Like, shit, I need to wipe down the surfaces or make the bed. None of it big. But it [still feels like] coming out of hyperspace.”</p><p>On day 28, just before dusk, his girlfriend helped him out of the guesthouse, leading him in a blindfold to the garden. Winston was gently hysterical, cackling and clapping, kneeling to touch the ground under his feet, stroking the bark of a tree and muttering, “Who made this?” When he gingerly removed his blindfold and used his sight for the first time in 672 hours he had to bow his head against the minimal glare. He stared at the horizon for a long time, and later explained what was going through his head: “the whole system rebooting…Like you’re being born, but this time with an adult head on…I remember I felt really innocent. Like those astronauts who look back on Earth and wonder how a war could ever happen, how we could all get so confused. [There was] a sense of the impending loss of that. I knew that before long I’d be back on the Central line, thinking that some stranger was an idiot for standing in the wrong place in the carriage.”</p><p>Before he lost that thinning sense of innocence, Winston wanted to capitalise on his experience. He dragged his girlfriend off on a walk and proposed to her. She said yes. Over the month away he’d lost weight and his pallid, almost puce-coloured skin had turned a raw burnished pink in the outdoor breeze. As long as she’d known Winston his eyes had been an unremarkable blue-grey. Now, when he removed his blindfold, she gasped. She rushed to take a picture. His eyes, after 28 days without anything to feast on, had turned a vivid baby blue.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Winston put the quirky photograph of his brightened eyes on Twitter, for his followers to see. He logged in, uploaded the JPEG, appended a pert little message and pressed send, digital chores that signalled as surely as anything that he was back in the world.</p><p>One afternoon in January this year I met Winston by Regent’s Canal in east London. He had just taught an art class nearby and was due back at his studio, where admin awaited him. More than a year had passed since the end of his monkish retreat and his eyes had returned to their regular blue-grey. Winston was carrying a large satchel, over-stuffed with cardboard tubes and when I asked what was in them he said it was his students’ work. That afternoon he had led a class in which he encouraged them to put on blindfolds to draw.</p><p>He had become an advocate for making art in the dark. Winston’s retreat had left him with conflicting feelings, but he was convinced of one thing: that a blast of darkness, taken in moderation, was a powerful creative tool. The boiled-down pitch he’d been making to other artists was that by depriving yourself of visual stimulus, the mind had to leave its comfortable grooves. Originality resulted. He was pleased with the large swirling pencil drawings that he’d made in the dark and had plans to exhibit them at the Barbican in London and the National Centre for Writing in Norwich. Winston had commissioned poets and novelists to undertake dark retreats, and been satisfied to hear from them that the freeing effects of dark-working carried over into other forms of creativity.</p><p>On his computer there were tons of emails that needed answering about the dual shows. Inbox (200), Inbox (300). One of the most time-consuming tasks, Winston admitted, had been his efforts to persuade curators in London and Norwich to construct enclosed black-out spaces, so that visitors could try immersion in the dark themselves. An hour or two at most, Winston suggested. Not 672.</p><p>He said he wouldn’t recommend what he’d done to any-one. A year on, Winston had finally found his bearings again but it took him months, maybe six, to get his equilibrium back. For a long time he couldn’t stop noticing every little inbound impression. In a city as loud and smelly as London that was too much to tolerate. After the retreat he often felt glum, almost bereaved, because, for all its terrors, the dark could be addictive. He pined for another immersion. This disturbed him.</p><p>Back at the studio we met his girlfriend. As usual, to record our conversations, I laid my iPhone on the table, beside a fail-safe iPad. Behind us, the studio computer flicked to a screensaver, hiding email software that teemed with to-dos. Unwilling to face these, Winston fooled about with a cardboard tube instead, using it as a loud hailer to pester his girlfriend. “Why haven’t we got married yet?” he boomed.</p><p>She smiled and said: “I don’t know,” throwing Winston an ambiguous look that I took to mean, “Because you’re the kind of person who might vanish on a black-out jag at any moment.” Winston sighed. Things had seemed simpler with the lights off. “I wanted to know, ‘How did we all get so confused?’ Because I couldn’t see the confusion. Now I can’t see the simplicity.”</p><p>He sat at the computer. Typed a bit. He was restless. Did I want to try it, Winston asked, the dark? The sun was setting outside the tenement windows. We could sneak in a couple of hours before I had to go home, he reckoned. Excited as a boy getting out his stickers, Winston grabbed two blindfolds from a hook and started shoving furniture to the walls. His girlfriend excused herself. I agreed to try and do some writing while Winston meditated and snoozed on the sofa nearby. The poet George Szirtes had been so uneasy about the coming dark, Winston recalled, that he needed his hand held. Don Paterson, another poet, had admitted that what truly terrified him was the prospect of his own uninterrupted company. “I’ll just be over here,” Winston said to me. There was a click and the lights went off.</p><p>From the sound of the sofa’s miniature rustlings, I tried to visualise the positions Winston shifted through. Then I listened to the creaks of the building’s heating system and the more distant trains. Taking up a pencil I started to make the scratchy beginnings on this story (what would eventually become paragraph three). After half an hour, surely no more, I heard Winston stir. He removed his blindfold and checked the time. Two hours had passed. With some reluctance, I pulled myself out of a middle-place of pale colours, crisp sound and slower, sedate thought. I said goodbye to Winston and headed for the nearby station. An electronic message board above the platform said the next train was 15 minutes away: unacceptable. I texted home to complain about this. The board rotated through station names, security warnings, bromides about respectful travel. A man beside me watched the new Scorsese on his upturned phone.</p><p><a id="solitude-has-always-been-both-a-blessing-and-a-curse"></a></p><h1 id="Solitude-has-always-been-both-a-blessing-and-a-curse"><a href="#Solitude-has-always-been-both-a-blessing-and-a-curse" class="headerlink" title="Solitude has always been both a blessing and a curse"></a>Solitude has always been both a blessing and a curse</h1><p>IN HIS “POLITICS” Aristotle argued that, thanks to the gift of language, man is destined to be a social and therefore a political animal. Yet the human instinct to socialise has always been balanced by an urge to withdraw into solitude. A few hermits make their lives in isolation, but many ordinary folk believe society is only tolerable if punctuated by frequent spells on their own. “There are many modern thinkers who emphasise the individual’s dependency upon society,” John Cowper Powys, a British writer and advocate of solitude, observed. “It is, on the contrary, only the cultivation of interior solitude, among crowded lives, that makes society endurable.”</p><p>Historians are for the most part solitary creatures themselves—the sort of people who, at school, preferred reading to team sports and, as adults, desperately try to avoid committees in order to spend more time in the library. All the same, they generally focus on gregarious activities, whether politicians on manoeuvres or the masses on the march. Bucking that trend, a couple of fascinating books on social isolation have appeared in time for the lockdown. Fay Bound Alberti has tried her hand at a history of loneliness. David Vincent focuses on loneliness’s rather more interesting sibling, solitude. Both concentrate on late modern Britain, Ms Alberti because she argues, somewhat unpersuasively, that loneliness is a recent phenomenon, the product of industrialisation and secularisation; Mr Vincent because he has spent a lifetime studying the country’s modern social history. What Aristotle called the “bird which flies alone” is finally getting his due.</p><p>Medieval Christendom saw some extraordinary feats of solitude. In the late third century St Anthony spent years in the desert with only scorpions and beasts for company. St Jerome tried a similar feat but took a large library with him. St Simeon Stylites upped the ante by sitting on top of a pillar in order to be closer to heaven. (“The progress of an ulcer in his thigh might shorten, but it could not disturb, this celestial life,” Edward Gibbon wrote in a wonderful description of the saint, “and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.”) Monasteries were refuges from the world that combined communal living with hours of solo prayer. Thomas Merton, a modern advocate of monasticism, claimed that “man’s loneliness is in fact the loneliness of God.”</p><p>The 18th and 19th centuries saw this cult of solitude reinvented in secular forms. Enlightenment philosophers argued that the key to a civilised life lay in mixing sociability and solitude in just the right doses: immerse yourself too deeply in urban life and you might become neurotic, but retreat for too long to the country and you might degenerate into a bearded barbarian. The Romantics thought the best way to create great art was to surround yourself with nature. John Clare began one poem: “O thou soothing Solitude/From the vain and from the rude”. William Wordsworth wandered “lonely as a cloud”. By taking long walks in remote places, such as the Lake District or the Alps, you could become what Robert Louis Stevenson later called “a pipe for any wind to play upon”.</p><p>The Romantics set off a lasting fashion for grappling with nature in the raw. In Britain intellectuals showed that scaling mountains and hiking long distances could connote brains as well as brawn (Leslie Stephen and G.M. Trevelyan thought nothing of walking from Cambridge to London for dinner). In America the march of civilisation generated a compensatory fascination with the wilderness. Henry David Thoreau retreated to Walden Pond. As a young man Teddy Roosevelt reinvented himself as a western cowboy by travelling around the Dakotas. As president he created National Parks to let ordinary Americans escape from the pressure of civilisation to a natural world of soaring peaks and wild animals. Many of the iconic images of 19th-century America capture a sense of solitude—the “lonesome cowboy” on cattle drives or the haunting sound of the train whistle in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Lost in the crowd</p><p>As Mr Vincent says, industrial society brought a spate of solitary hobbies within reach by boosting living standards and enlarging personal space. Women with a little time on their hands took up pastimes that had once been necessities, such as cooking, dressmaking and embroidery. Men tried pigeon-breeding and stamp-collecting. People of both sexes took on jigsaw puzzles and, from the 1920s, crosswords. The cult of solitude also encouraged less healthy habits. Charles Kingsley, a subscriber to “muscular Christianity”, regarded tobacco as the ideal accompaniment to the solitary life—“a lone man’s companion, a bachelor’s friend, a hungry man’s food, a sad man’s cordial, a wakeful man’s sleep, and a chilly man’s fire”. Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes preferred an opium pipe to ignite his solitary reveries.</p><p>Healthy or otherwise, these hobbies united a nation that was divided by class. Britain’s allotment movement meant that, by 1910, half a million working-class men could enjoy the pleasures of gardening. Such activities also married sociability with solitude. Smokers shared their solitary vice in dedicated rooms in clubs and pubs. Angling encouraged people to collaborate on being alone. “We may club together as against others, but by the water we divide,” Morley Roberts wrote in 1932. “When I fish I am the universe.”</p><p>Yet the more civilisation has advanced, the further people have had to go to achieve that sensation. Starting with Joshua Slocum in 1895, solo yachtsmen sailed around the world, sometimes cutting themselves off from all outside help. Robin Knox-Johnston, for example, didn’t talk to anyone for five months. Mountaineers competed with each other to slip the knot of civilisation. In 2017 Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan in Yosemite with neither companions nor crampons. These extraordinary battles against nature were inspired by the belief that the best way to explore body and soul is to strip the self to its essence. “It is here, in the immense desert of the Southern Ocean,” Bernard Moitessier wrote, “that I feel most strongly how much man is both atom and god.”</p><p>And the more sophisticated civilisation has become, the more people have been willing to use its fruits to escape the enforced sociability that has mostly been humanity’s lot. In 1900 just 5% of households comprised one person. Today a quarter do in America, along with a third in Britain and perhaps half in Sweden. Sometimes the solo life is a choice: people use their money to dump an unsatisfactory partner. Sometimes it is a tragedy: in Britain a million older people say they routinely suffer from loneliness. Most feel unable to admit their plight to friends and relatives.</p><p>This points to the paradox at the heart of solitude, which, as Mr Vincent says, can be both a blessing and a curse. Loneliness and solitude are not the same: you can feel lonely in a crowd—indeed loneliness is at its darkest when you are surrounded by people having fun—but they overlap. Unwanted solitude can lead to the most miserable sort of loneliness. “I’d like to meet,” C.S. Lewis wrote to a friend after his wife died, “for I am—Oh God that I were not—very free now. One doesn’t realise in early life that the price of freedom is loneliness. To be happy is to be tied.”</p><p>Even voluntary solitude can foster mental illness. In the early modern period John Evelyn warned that solitude “creates witches”. Samuel-Auguste Tissot feared it led to masturbation and all that masturbation entails, “melancholy, sighing, tears, palpitations, suffocations and faintings”. The first great book devoted to solitude, by George III’s personal doctor, Johann Georg Zimmerman, was titled “Solitude Considered with Respect to its Dangerous Influence Upon the Mind and Heart” (1791). Joseph Conrad condemns his character Nostromo to die of solitude, “the enemy known but to few on this Earth, and whom only the simplest of us are fit to withstand”.</p><p>Given its power to break the spirit, loneliness has inevitably been used as a punishment. Pentonville, Britain’s first model prison built on Utilitarian principles, confined all prisoners in solitary cells, though it dropped the face masks that, in Jeremy Bentham’s original design, they were supposed to wear to stop them communicating during meals. The most extreme use of solitary confinement was in a wing of a state prison in Auburn, New York, where inmates were confined in total solitude, with no exercise and no human contact of any kind. Gustave de Beaumont and Alexis de Tocqueville were appalled when they visited the place in 1833: “In order to reform them they have been submitted to complete isolation; but this absolute solitude, if nothing interrupt it, is beyond the strength of man; it destroys the criminal without intermission and without pity; it does not reform, it kills.”</p><p>Ms Alberti notes that anxiety over involuntary loneliness has become a big political issue, particularly in northern European and Anglo-Saxon countries, where the breakdown of the family has gone furthest. In 2016 the BBC released a television documentary on “the age of loneliness”. In 2017 Vivek Murthy, America’s former surgeon general, declared an “epidemic of loneliness”. In 2018 Theresa May appointed Britain’s first “minister for loneliness”, declaring that “up to a fifth of UK adults feel lonely most or all of the time.”</p><p>Life in the quiet carriage</p><p>The history of solitude is thus partly a history of extremes—of people who have willingly sat on top of pillars for decades and of prison reformers who aim to use loneliness to break men’s souls. But it is also a history of the quest for balance.</p><p>The healthiest form of solitude is a flexible kind that combines it with sociability as necessary. Modern technology has made it both easier and harder to get the balance right. On the one hand, it has introduced what Mr Vincent calls “networked solitude”. Just as St Jerome squatted in his cave surrounded by his library, so modern hermits can sit in their flats gorging on downloaded books and films or chatting with friends across the world. On the other hand, it has made it more difficult to enjoy the benefits of solitude. Distraction is always one click away. And the same technology that allows the solitary individual to engage remotely with society also allows society to engage remotely—and sometimes secretly—with the individual. Giant companies watch over you whether you are alone or in a crowd.</p><p>There is also something disturbing about the way the boundaries between solitude and sociability are blurring. Visit a gym and you see sweaty solipsists performing private workouts in public. On a train many of your fellow passengers will be insulated by headphones. Those ubiquitous devices are double-edged: they can fill your head with babble or, thanks to noise-cancelling, leave you in Trappist silence. As the two categories mingle, so the quest for balance becomes more intense. Popular modern fads offer a reacquaintance with the virtues of solitude: mindfulness provides access to peace and silence; some of the most popular pastimes in Silicon Valley, the source of so much noise and distraction, are hiking, yoga and meditation.</p><p>The lockdown has put the question of solitude at the heart of politics. Social distancing has been a tragedy for those living and, in some cases, dying alone. But for others it has proved a strange blessing. Overworked people have been able to take a break from the treadmill of commuting. Many have picked up long-abandoned hobbies, such as tending the garden or playing bridge. Solitude is both one of mankind’s greatest blessings and greatest curses—and thanks to a virus that has been carried across the world by human sociability, more people than ever are getting the chance to experience both. </p><p><a id="why-j-m-barrie-created-peter-pan"></a></p><h1 id="Why-J-M-Barrie-Created-Peter-Pan"><a href="#Why-J-M-Barrie-Created-Peter-Pan" class="headerlink" title="Why J. M. Barrie Created Peter Pan"></a>Why J. M. Barrie Created Peter Pan</h1><p>Almost a hundred years ago, at half past eight on the evening of December 27, 1904, the curtain went up at the Duke of York’s Theatre, in London, to reveal, among other things, a man dressed as a dog. The man was an actor named Arthur Lupino, suffering for his art in a shaggy costume, and the dog was called Nana. Most plays enjoy a fitful life, at best, but we can be fairly sure that this winter grown men will once again drop on all fours and work up a canine sweat, while grown women will crop their hair, pull on green tights, and turn into temporary boys. The play is “Peter Pan,” and, like its eponymous hero, it gives freakishly little sign of growing old.</p><p>The author was J. M. Barrie: Jimmy to some of his friends, and, in his later pomp, Sir James. He was short and slight, with bags under his eyes and a pale, protuberant brow, like a clever schoolboy who has stayed up late reading books under the bedclothes. He had a heavy mustache and a pipe smoker’s percussive cough. Of humble origins, he grew rich, yet his choice of overcoat remained several sizes too large, as if he were wearing a father’s hand-me-down. Both in face and in body—and, it became apparent, in the lineaments of his soul—Barrie seemed ill-suited to adult life, and those neat, child-friendly features sank all too readily into the caved-in sadness of old age.</p><p>Up to his death, in 1937, Barrie, as a result of his novels and plays, was one of the most famous men of his day; when Chaplin, on a trip to London in 1921, was asked whom he most wanted to meet, the answer was J. M. Barrie. Not even Barrie’s ardent admirers, however, would have described him as a matinée idol, and he would have been wryly flattered to find himself reincarnated, for the centenary of “Peter Pan,” in the beauteous person of Johnny Depp. A new film, entitled “Finding Neverland,” tells the story—or a decorated version of the story—of J. M. Barrie and the circumstances under which Peter Pan leaped into existence. Depp resembles Barrie in no way, except in his slenderness of form. We get a passable, soft stab at a Scottish burr but no mustache; we see more of the sweet side of Barrie than the insidious flip side; and the harshest coughing in the film comes not from Depp but from Kate Winslet, who plays Barrie’s friend Sylvia Llewellyn Davies.</p><p>Sylvia was one of a number of strong, rather Shakespearean female figures who ringed the life of Barrie—a dominance that began, unsurprisingly, with his mother. She was Margaret Ogilvy, a stonemason’s daughter who hailed from a particularly hard outcrop of the Presbyterian Church. James was born in 1860, the son of Margaret and a weaver named Alexander Barrie, in the Scottish town of Kirriemuir, and, until the age of six, he played in the shadow of his gifted and handsome older brother, David. Then, in the winter of 1867, David was killed; he was hit by a fellow ice-skater, fell, and cracked his skull. Margaret took to her bed under the onslaught of grief, and young James was dispatched to offer comfort:</p><blockquote><p>The room was dark, and when I heard the door shut and no sound come from the bed I was afraid, and I stood still. I suppose I was breathing hard, or perhaps I was crying, for after a time I heard a listless voice that had never been listless before say, “Is that you?” I think the tone hurt me, for I made no answer, and then the voice said more anxiously “Is that you?” again. I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to, and I said in a little lonely voice, “No, it’s no’ him, it’s just me.” Then I heard a cry, and my mother turned in bed, and though it was dark I knew that she was holding out her arms.</p></blockquote><p>From here on, James worshipped his dead brother with a devotion that carried the taint of jealousy. Once, he even entered his mother’s presence wearing a suit of David’s clothes. The residue of the calamity, as it eventually seeped into Barrie’s art, was the conviction that a perfect child who dies on the eve of his fourteenth birthday will be spared the degradation of growing up, and that the death will be outshone by the thought of the perfection—so blindingly, perhaps, that the boy will seem scarcely to have passed away at all.</p><p>We think of Barrie as one of the chief explorers—or, in a gloomier light, invaders—of childhood. Yet the childhood that gripped him most tightly was not his own but that of other people; it is almost as if his own did not exist. The souls around him were like books, ripe for perusal, and he preferred their opening chapters. Hence “Margaret Ogilvy” (1896), which in part is a memoir of his mother’s youth. One of Barrie’s biographers, Denis Mackail, calls it “that distressingly human and inhuman book,” presumably because it demonstrates, even more than “Peter Pan,” the weird twinning of Barrie’s gifts—an almost telepathic self-spiriting into the emotions of others, and a professional shamelessness about baring them in public. Listen to his proud recital of Margaret Ogilvy’s deprivations: “She was eight when her mother’s death made her mistress of the house and mother to her little brother, and from that time she scrubbed and mended and baked and sewed.” At once we see that image skipping the generations, from mother to son, and from the son to the Wendy of “Peter Pan,” who was obliged, when she flew to Neverland and found a host of unclaimed children, to become a mother before her time.</p><p>The Barrie family—James was one of ten children, two of whom died in infancy—was ardently ambitious for its sons, the tool of that ambition was education, and Barrie duly studied at Dumfries Academy and at Edinburgh University. He emerged timid but industrious, and plowed a path into local and then national journalism. He moved to London, and, in 1887, produced his first novel, which bore the title “Better Dead.” Within a few years, thanks largely to some sharp, rosy fictions set in Scotland and to “The Little Minister,” a quaint tale of a minister who falls in love with a Gypsy, he had acquired not just a solid readership but a serious reputation; all of a sudden, we find him in correspondence with Thomas Hardy and Robert Louis Stevenson. He started writing for the theatre, kicking off with a parody of Ibsen, and indulging in the traditional sport of losing his heart to the leading ladies. His most acute biographer, Andrew Birkin—whose “J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys” has been granted a timely reissue (Yale; $18.95)—digs up some astounding entries from Barrie’s private notebooks. Some are composed in the third person, as jottings toward a possible novel:</p><blockquote><p>—Greatest horror—dream I am married—wake up shrieking.<br>—Even while proposing, the thought of how it wd <em>read</em> go thro’ him.<br>—He never has contact with a woman—If he had this might have made him exult less in making women love him.</p></blockquote><p>In 1894, ignoring these self-cautions, Barrie married an actress named Mary Ansell, bestowing upon her, by way of a wedding present, a St. Bernard dog. The saga of Barrie is full of long-sufferers, the longest being Barrie himself, but nobody could follow its course and not spare a wealth of pity for Mary. Her husband loved many women, but the evidence suggests that the actual making of love lay outside his interests, or beyond his grasp. The creator of “Peter Pan” never had a child of his own. To us, the bewildering thing (and to Mary, surely the roughest insult) was that Barrie, far from burying his secret incapacities, dug them up like a pirate uncovering a treasure chest: “Grizel, I seem to be different from all other men; there seems to be some curse upon me… . You are the only woman I ever wanted to love, but apparently I can’t.” That comes from “Tommy and Grizel,” the tale of a devastated marriage which was published six years into Barrie’s own. At one point, the narrator says of Tommy, the fruitless husband, “He was a boy who could not grow up,” adding, of Grizel, “He gave her all his affection, but his passion, like an outlaw, had ever to hunt alone.” So where did the distinguished author like to hunt?</p><p>The answer is specific: Kensington Gardens, the broad, half-empty stretch of greenery next to Hyde Park. Here, in 1898, Barrie met a pair of boys, George and Jack Llewellyn Davies, aged five and four, who walked there with their nurse. They were amused by the small Scotsman with the enormous dog. Barrie talked with children, rather than at or down to them, and the meetings with George and Jack became drawn into the rhythm of their days. To our panicked eyes, such a relationship would be unthinkable—or, if thought about, nipped in the bud. We assume that a strange man, nearing forty, in a public place can offer only one thing to children still in knickerbockers, and that is harm. We would call the police, or, at least, call our children away. If we discovered the man to be a celebrity, we might call our lawyers, or, if we were feeling spiteful, the newspapers. And, if we were later to read what he wrote about our children, in an account so lightly ornamented as hardly to count as fiction, we might not be responsible for our actions:</p><blockquote><p>I returned to David, and asked him in a low voice whether he would give me a kiss. He shook his head about six times, and I was in despair. Then the smile came, and I knew that he was teasing me only. He now nodded his head about six times.<br>That was the prettiest of all his exploits.</p></blockquote><p>The tone of this, written in 1902, grates nastily on modern ears. Ever since “Lolita,” we have realized that one of the pleasures of the child-seeker is not merely to play games with the victim but to pretend that the victim is complicit in that game, or even pulling the strings; thus is the burden of guilt shifted smoothly away from the raptor. Did readers of 1902 feel nothing of the sort, or are we the guilty party, unable to conjure a time when playfulness was its own reward, rather than an alibi or a ruse? The passage comes from “The Little White Bird,” Barrie’s half-disguised novel about George Llewellyn Davies. In the book, George becomes David—note the name of Barrie’s dead brother—and is befriended by the bachelor narrator, who pretends to have a son of his own. This son, he then declares, has died (somewhere around here, the sheer weirdness of Barrie starts to multiply out of control), and he uses the nonexistent death to ingratiate himself further with David’s parents. He is especially pleased that David’s mother, Mary—note the name of Barrie’s wife—is “culpably obtuse to my sinister design,” the design being “to burrow under Mary’s influence with the boy, expose her to him in all his vagaries, take him utterly from her and make him mine.” Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may retire to consider your verdict.</p><p>Yet the stubborn fact remains: J. M. Barrie was innocent. He no more sought sex from children than he did from women. Andrew Birkin, who knows more about Barrie than anybody else (the last Llewellyn Davies boy, Nico, having died in 1980), has arrived at the balanced conclusion that the author of “Peter Pan” was “a lover of childhood, but was not in any sexual sense the paedophile that some claim him to have been.” His sinister design, it turns out, was not to corrupt boys with the murk of adult desire but to slough off any corruptions of his own, rejoin the unadulterated—the very word shows up the impurities in grownup life—and shrink once more, as best he could, into boyhood. This plan of Barrie’s may have been creepy and pathetic, but it was not a crime, and, as weaknesses go, it may be the most widespread in the world, haunting every harassed male who lies awake and tells himself how much simpler everything was as a kid.</p><p>At the heart of “The Little White Bird” is a story that the narrator slowly invents not only for David’s entertainment but with David’s help. It is about a boy named Peter Pan, who lives in Kensington Gardens. The first name is a direct allusion to the fact that George Llewellyn Davies now had another brother, Peter, born in 1897. There would be two more: Michael, born in 1900, and Nicholas (or Nico), born in 1903; a sisterless five in all, rather than the four of “Finding Neverland.” The film also opts for Peter Llewellyn Davies as the focus of Barrie’s attention—a not unnatural choice, given his name, but the wrong one, for it was really the whole gang of them whom Barrie loved. If he had a favorite, it was Michael, but, as the notorious preface to “Peter Pan”—dedicated “To the Five”—explains, “I always knew that I made Peter by rubbing the five of you violently together, as savages with two sticks produce a flame…. That is all he is, the spark I got from you.”</p><p>The course of the flame is a tricky one to trace, and what matters is that in Peter Pan Barrie achieved the rarest alchemy of all, the one that no writer can plan or predict: he invented a myth. The idea of Peter seems to have been flying around forever, a constant of humanity, and all that Barrie had to do was reach up and pluck the boy out of the air. After his first appearance, in “The Little White Bird,” Peter outgrew the nest; the passages about him were revised and republished, with illustrations of delicate grotesquerie by Arthur Rackham, under the title “Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens,” in 1906. In the meantime, the play, after its London début, was triumphantly staged in New York in the winter of 1905. The novel we now think of as “Peter Pan” is actually called “Peter and Wendy,” and it first saw the light in 1911. It is worth emphasizing that much of this material is close to unreadable—sometimes because it is sappy with sentiment but mostly because it is just too gnarled and knotted for current taste (increasing one’s reverence for Rackham, who saw its warpings at once), let alone for that of our children. What on earth will they make, for instance, of the opening pages of the novel, in which Mr. and Mrs. Darling, Wendy’s parents, are seen deciding whether they can afford to have more babies—literally adding up the doctors’ fees for the infant diseases (“measles one five, German measles half a guinea”) that they will be called upon to nurse?</p><p>Barrie would remonstrate severely on this point. He would claim that children cleave naturally to the misshapen and the morbid; like Roald Dahl, he admired the heartlessness and cunning of the young far more than he did their good behavior, and, for every mention of skipping fairies in “Peter Pan,” there will be some dashed-off sketch of alarming and sanguinary malice. Look between the cracks of the play, in the stage directions, and you will find his prose hardening and cooling into casual sadism, as in this line about Tootles, one of the pirate boys in Neverland:</p><blockquote><p>He has been in fewer adventures than any of them because the big things constantly happen while he has stepped round the corner; he will go off, for instance, in some quiet hour to gather firewood, and then when he returns the others will be sweeping up the blood.</p></blockquote><p>The most unfeeling child of all, needless to say, is Peter Pan himself. He flits through the play and the novels, and he has flitted through a century of stage productions and movies, and one result of those flittings is that we regard him as airy and innocuous. In truth, he is mean and green, a mini-monster of capering egotism; could there be any more dazzling proof of self-regard than a boy who first shows up in pursuit of his own shadow? In the early versions of the play, there is no Captain Hook, because there is no need for him; Peter supplies all the cruelty that is required. As “Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens” makes clear, our hero escaped from his parents as a baby and, after much prevarication, decided to forsake them for the unwithering plea-sure gardens of Kensington. He would fly back like a bird to watch his sleeping mother, but, once the decision was made, his way was barred—“When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time. The iron bars are up for life.” Such is Peter’s tragedy, but only because it was also his choice, and we should recall the terrifying title that Barrie appended to an early draft of the story: “The Boy Who Hated Mothers.”</p><p>And what of the real mother? Sylvia Llewellyn Davies first met Barrie at a dinner party in 1897; as the evening progressed, she realized that he was the man who wiggled his eyebrows at her children in the park. This revelation seems to have charmed rather than offended her; Barrie and she would be intimate friends for the rest of her life. Kate Winslet, who plays Sylvia in “Finding Neverland,” is ideal for the role, because she radiates that peculiar ease which starts to appear in photographs toward the end of the nineteenth century—no longer prim and straitened but open-faced, trusting, educated, and not without flickers of fire. In short, Sylvia (the daughter of a fast-witted literary clan, the du Mauriers) was altogether more modern than her husband, Arthur—scholar, lawyer, and stiff. Yet he, too, adored his boys, and it may be unfair of “Finding Neverland” to elide him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered the consciousness—and, little by little, the home—of the Llewellyn Davies family. Soon, he was staying for tea, and then to wish the boys good night, and before long the Llewellyn Davieses were invited down to the Barries’ house in the country for idyllic vacations. He began as Mr. Barrie the author, and grew into Uncle Jim. It was all too much for Barrie’s wife, who, in the end, sought understandable consolation in the arms of another man; Barrie, in turn, sought a divorce, which was granted in 1909.</p><p>“Finding Neverland” is a weepie, and some viewers will mock it on that score, but it needs to be defended. First, because these days a good weepie is hard to find. And, second, because there is so much to weep about—far more, in fact, than you would gather from the film, which closes decorously after the death of Sylvia. (If you want a more accurate and leisurely testament, you could go online and order the DVD of “J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys”—a wonderful TV drama, written by Andrew Birkin and running to four and a half hours, that the BBC produced in 1978, with Ian Holm providing the definitive Barrie.) From the moment that Barrie met George and Jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story becomes a dismal catalogue of mortality:</p><p>1907—Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies from cancer of the jaw.</p><p>1910—Sylvia dies of lung cancer. The five boys are orphaned; Barrie is made their guardian.</p><p>1915—George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders.</p><p>1921—Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.</p><p>All of this was enough to wreck Barrie, or, at least, to throw intolerable shadows over the remainder of his life. Few of his works, aside from “Peter Pan” and his desert-island comedy of class conflict, “The Admirable Crichton,” are remembered now, yet in 1922 he was invested with the Order of Merit, the grandest of British honors. He died in 1937, and we should be thankful that he didn’t live to be a hundred, and so to witness the terrible final act. On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie’s birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in “Peter Pan”—“that terrible masterpiece,” in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies. His numerous comments on the genesis of the work, as quoted in Janet Dunbar’s 1970 biography of Barrie, are judicious, amused, and apparently unperturbed. But the effect of “Peter Pan” was like that of those iron bars on the hero’s family home; it is a kind of prison drama played onstage as a slice of festive cheer, and it locked the Llewellyn Davies boys into the garden of pre-puberty as surely as Pan himself is locked out from his mother’s embrace.</p><p>Does that make Barrie the bringer of mischance, after all? Peter “is never touched by any one in the play,” a stage direction in “Peter Pan” reads, and Barrie never touched his young charges—as Peter Llewellyn Davies confirmed—with anything more than affection. Once Arthur and Sylvia had died, Barrie, in loco parentis, fulfilled his duties with diligence and pride. But the damage, unwitting as it was, had been done long before, not by Barrie the middle-aged man but by Barrie the successful author; in making the Five the tinder for Peter Pan, he treated them as ideal spirits made flesh, and no child should be freighted with such an embarrassing burden. Their innocence was imperilled from the moment that it became prime-quality material for his elaborate public fantasies, and there may never have been a more desperate or acquisitive dedication than the one at the start of “Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens”: “To Sylvia and Arthur Llewellyn Davies and their boys (my boys).”</p><p>Barrie was a wounded creature, from his earliest youth, and his probing of that wound is what makes “Peter Pan” so enduringly painful to read. Toward the end of the novel, an immutable Peter drops in to find the adult Wendy, now a mother herself, as if he were the ghost of David Barrie, still cold from that skating accident, alighting beside Margaret Ogilvy. The tensions are bald and excruciating:</p><blockquote><p>He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.<br>“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.<br>“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible. Something inside of her was crying, “Woman, woman, let go of me.”</p></blockquote><p>Is this really the stuff of classic children’s fiction? Do people still read “Peter Pan,” or has Peter shrunk to a brand by now, a chirping Disney figure wrenched from the unsettling landscapes where he originally appeared? If so, he demands restitution, for he sprang from the mind of an oddball, and he is not alone. Consider Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, and J. M. Barrie: the stammerer with the camera, the wandering epileptic, and the coughing frequenter of playgrounds. The great dreamers of English children’s literature were not, as it happens, dreamy types at all but exacting, even pedantic, in the dramatizing of their fathomless unhappiness. If their characters are pricked by a helpless urge to travel—down a rabbit hole, to sea in a sieve, second star to the right and straight on till morning—it is because there is always something, a drab existence or a dreadful past, that begs to be fled. Open a page of “Harry Potter,” by contrast, and you know that it was written by a clever, funny woman of sound mind, with a keen commercial eye and a Barrie-like love of the fizzing narratives for which children naturally thirst; but there is nothing smarting beneath, no ominous beat of the heartsick. Harry will grow up, and we think it only proper that he should; but will he continue to taunt and haunt us, a hundred years from now, like the boy who never did?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JUST THE TICKET</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed Anthony Lane’s ode to night trains(“Because the Night,” May 11th).I had the pleasure of riding the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express from Istanbul to Paris last summer, and thus feel compelled to contest Lane’s clever swipe at the types of passenger many believe to be on board this luxurious locomotive. I had a twin cabin; though expensive, it did not have the thirty-seven-thousand-dollar ticket price of the Cabin Suite. And, happily, my conversations consisted of topics much more interesting than the “same anecdote, from the same retired fund manager, all the way across a continent.” Far from being loathsome fat cat financiers, many passengers had saved for years to take this trip of a lifetime, just as I did. They ran the gamut from two longtime friends from Australia to a retired oncologist and his seriously ill wife; a woman who worked on the 9/11 victim-compensation fund; and a young man and his mother, to whom he’d given the trip for her fiftieth birthday. It was an incredible experience, and I look forward to more sleeping-car trips in the future.</p><span id="more"></span><p>我非常喜欢安东尼·莱恩(Anthony Lane)对夜间列车的颂歌(《因为夜晚》[Because the night]， 5月11日)。去年夏天，我有幸乘坐了从伊斯坦布尔到巴黎的威尼斯辛普朗-东方快车(Venice Simplon-Orient-Express)，因此我觉得有必要对莱恩巧妙的抨击乘客类型进行反驳，大多认为是这辆豪华列车上的乘客。我有一个双人舱;虽然很贵，但它不像客舱套间那样要三万七千美元的票价。幸运的是，我的谈话内容远比“ 整个大陆上同一个退休基金经理讲的同一件轶事”有趣得多。许多乘客根本不是令人讨厌的有钱的金融家，而是像我一样，为了这次一生难忘的旅行而存了多年的钱。乘客各式各样，从两位来自澳大利亚的老朋友到一位退休的肿瘤医生和他身患重病的妻子;一位在911受害者赔偿基金工作的女性;还有一个年轻人和他的母亲，他把这趟旅行作为她50岁生日的礼物送给了她。这是一次不可思议的经历，我期待着未来有更多的卧铺之旅。</p><p>Janet Paist New York City</p><p>Lane’s love letter to the night train was enchanting. I’ve crossed the United States twice and the Canadian border once on Amtrak,seated each time. It’s a lot like camping: sleeping in uncomfortable positions, preparing instant noodles by moonlight, and approximating a shower using a water bottle and a sink. Night-train journeys both whet our appetite for adventure and develop our sense of scale. The trip from New York to San Francisco once took more than a year and required you to winch your wagon down the granite slopes of the Sierras. How miraculous is it that, today, you can travel cross-country relatively efficiently, but still stick your head out the window and let the desert wind whip your hair, or watch the moon rise over the snowy Rocky Mountains from the sightseeing car? For the planet’s sake, those of us lucky enough to have the means to travel don’t just need to find greener substitutes for flying; we need to once again allow cross-continental journeys to be full of grandeur. During these homebound times,Lane’s piece offered an important reminder about the power of travel, as well as a wonderful escape back into the wider world.</p><p>莱恩写给夜班火车的情书很迷人。我曾两次穿越美国，一次坐Amtrak穿越加拿大边境，每次都是坐着。这很像野营:以不舒服的姿势睡觉，在月光下准备方便面，用水瓶和水槽洗澡。夜间火车旅行既刺激了我们的冒险欲望，又培养了我们的感知范围。从纽约到旧金山的旅程曾经需要花了一年多的时间，需要你用绞车将马车从山脉的花岗岩山坡拉下。今天，你可以相对高效地进行越野旅行，但仍然把头v伸出窗外，让沙漠的风吹动你的头发，或者从观光车上看着月亮从落基山脉的雪山上升起，这是多么不可思议啊!看在地球的份上，我们这些有能力旅行的人，不只是要寻找更环保的交通工具来代替飞行，我们需要再次让跨洲旅行充满了宏伟的气势。在这个无法出门的时间里，莱恩的文章提醒了人们旅行的力量，同时也让我们回到了更广阔的世界。</p><p>Sophia Kakarala B1rooklyn, N.Y</p><p>UNTIL THE SHOOTING STOPS I read Jill Lepore’s analysis of the violence at Kent State,Jackson State, and elsewhere with interest and emotion (Books, May 4th). In 1970, for a journalism course at Berkeley, I wrote a paper comparing the media coverage, in regional papers and national magazines, of the incidents at Kent State and Jackson State and in Augusta, Georgia. I found, among other things, that the San Francisco Examiner gave more than three times as many column inches to Kent State, where four white students were killed, as it did to Augusta and Jackson State, where, collectively, eight black people were killed. The students at Kent State had their biographies outlined all over the press, but, in a story about the Augusta and Jackson State shootings in Time’s May 25th issue, the six men killed in Augusta weren’t even named. In summary, I wrote that “the whites were mourned, the blacks merely mentioned,”and concluded that “in America, it seems, we will not grant equality even to the dead.” As Lepore writes, we will go on not only suffering but suffering unequally “until the shooting stops.” </p><p>在《直到枪声停止》（UNTIL THE SHOOTING STOPS）一书中，我读了吉尔-莱波尔（Jill Lepore）对肯特州立大学、杰克逊州立大学和其他地方的暴力事件的分析，并感慨万千（Books，5月4日）。1970年，我在伯克利大学的一门新闻学课程中，写了一篇论文，比较了地区性报纸和全国性杂志对肯特州立大学、杰克逊州立大学和佐治亚州奥古斯塔事件的媒体报道。我发现，《旧金山问卷者》给肯特州立大学的专栏篇幅是给奥古斯塔和杰克逊州立大学的三倍多，肯特州立大学有四名白人学生被杀，而奥古斯塔和杰克逊州立大学总共有八名黑人学生被杀。肯特州立大学的学生们的传记被刊登在了各大报刊上，但在《时代》杂志5月25日刊登的一篇关于奥古斯塔和杰克逊州立大学枪击事件的报道中，在奥古斯塔被枪杀的六名男子甚至连名字都没有提到。总之，我写道，“白人受到哀悼，黑人只是被提到”，并得出结论，“在美国，似乎我们甚至不会赋予死者平等权利。”正如勒波雷所写，我们不仅会继续受苦，而且会不平等地受苦，“直到枪声停止”。</p><p>Nancy Roberts Healdsburg, Calif</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EVEN BEFORE the pandemic, globalisation was in trouble. The open system of trade that had dominated the world economy for decades had been damaged by the financial crash and the Sino-American trade war. Now it is reeling from its third body-blow in a dozen years as lockdowns have sealed borders and disrupted commerce (see ). The number of passengers at Heathrow has dropped by 97% year-on-year; Mexican car exports fell by 90% in April; 21% of transpacific container-sailings in May have been cancelled. As economies reopen, activity will recover, but don’t expect a quick return to a carefree world of unfettered movement and free trade. The pandemic will politicise travel and migration and entrench a bias towards self-reliance. This inward-looking lurch will enfeeble the recovery, leave the economy vulnerable and spread geopolitical instability.</p><span id="more"></span><p>甚至在大流行之前，全球化就陷入了困境。几十年来主导世界经济的开放贸易体系已经被金融危机和中美贸易战破坏。现在，由于封锁了边境，扰乱了商业，它正遭受着十多年来的第三次沉重打击。希思罗机场的乘客数量同比下降了97%;4月份墨西哥汽车出口下降了90%;五月份，21%的跨太平洋集装箱航班被取消。随着经济重新开放，经济活动将会复苏，但不要指望会很快回到自由流动和自由贸易的无忧无虑的世界。大流行将使旅行和移民政治化，并使人们更加倾向于自力更生。这种向内倾斜将削弱复苏，使经济脆弱，并蔓延地缘政治不稳定。</p><p>The world has had several epochs of integration, but the trading system that emerged in the 1990s went further than ever before. China became the world’s factory and borders opened to people, goods, capital and information (see ). After Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 most banks and some multinational firms pulled back. Trade and foreign investment stagnated relative to GDP, a process this newspaper later called slowbalisation. Then came President Donald Trump’s trade wars, which mixed worries about blue-collar jobs and China’s autocratic capitalism with a broader agenda of chauvinism and contempt for alliances. At the moment when the virus first started to spread in Wuhan last year, America’s tariff rate on imports was back to its highest level since 1993 and both America and China had begun to decouple their technology industries.</p><p>世界已经经历了几个一体化的时代，但上世纪90年代出现的贸易体系比以往任何时候都走得更远。它成为了世界工厂，向人们、商品、资本和信息开放了边界。2008年雷曼兄弟破产后，大多数银行和一些跨国公司都撤出了市场。贸易和外国投资相对于国内生产总值(GDP)停滞不前，本报后来将这一过程称为“缓慢平衡”(slowbalisation)。然后是唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)总统的贸易战，这场贸易战既有对蓝领工作和中国专制资本主义的担忧，也有更广泛的沙文主义和对联盟的蔑视。当病毒去年开始在武汉传播的时候，美国的进口关税回到了1993年以来的最高水平，美国和中国已经开始脱钩他们的技术产业。</p><p>Since January a new wave of disruption has spread westward from Asia. Factory, shop and office closures have caused demand to tumble and prevented suppliers from reaching customers. The damage is not universal. Food is still getting through, Apple insists it can still make iPhones and China’s exports have held up so far, buoyed by sales of medical gear. But the overall effect is savage. World goods trade may shrink by 10-30% this year. In the first ten days of May exports from South Korea, a trade powerhouse, fell by 46% year-on-year, probably the worst decline since records began in 1967.</p><p>自1月份以来，一波新的破坏浪潮从亚洲向西蔓延。工厂、商店和办公室的关闭导致需求暴跌，并使供应商无法接触到客户。这种损害并不是普遍的。食品仍在运输途中，苹果坚称仍有能力生产iphone，而中国的出口在医疗设备销售的推动下迄今保持稳定。但总体效果是残酷的。今年，世界货物贸易可能缩水10-30%。五月的前十天，韩国这个贸易大国的出口同比下降46%，这可能是自1967年有记录以来最严重的下降。</p><p>The underlying anarchy of global governance is being exposed. France and Britain have squabbled over quarantine rules, China is threatening Australia with punitive tariffs for demanding an investigation into the virus’s origins and the White House remains on the warpath about trade. Despite some instances of co-operation during the pandemic, such as the Federal Reserve’s loans to other central banks, America has been reluctant to act as the world’s leader. Chaos and division at home have damaged its prestige. China’s secrecy and bullying have confirmed that it is unwilling—and unfit—to pick up the mantle. Around the world, public opinion is shifting away from globalisation. People have been disturbed to find that their health depends on a brawl to import protective equipment and on the migrant workers who work in care homes and harvest crops.</p><p>全球治理的无政府状态正在暴露出来。法国和英国在检疫规则问题上争吵不休，法国和英国在检疫规则上发生了争执，中国威胁要对澳大利亚征收惩罚性关税，因为澳大利亚要求对病毒的来源进行调查，而白宫仍在为贸易问题争吵不休。尽管在疫情发生期间出现了一些合作的情况，比如美联储向其他央行提供贷款，但美国一直不愿意充当世界的领导者。国内的混乱和分裂破坏了美国的威信。中国的秘密和欺凌证实了它不愿意也不适合拿起衣钵。在全球范围内，公众舆论正在远离全球化。人们不安地发现，他们的健康取决于进口防护用品的争斗，以及在养老院工作和收割庄稼的农民工。</p><p>This is just the start. Although the flow of information is largely free outside China, the movement of people, goods and capital is not. Consider people first. The Trump administration is proposing to curtail immigration further, arguing that jobs should go to Americans instead. Other countries are likely to follow. Travel is restricted, limiting the scope to find work, inspect plants and drum up orders. Some 90% of people live in countries with largely closed borders. Many governments will open up only to countries with similar health protocols: one such “travel bubble” is mooted to include Australia and New Zealand and, perhaps, Taiwan and Singapore (see ). The industry is signalling that the disruption to travel will be lasting. Airbus has cut production by a third and Emirates, a symbol of globalisation, expects no recovery until 2022.</p><p>这仅仅是个开始。尽管信息在中国境外的流动基本上是自由的，但人员、商品和资本的流动却不是。首先考虑的人。特朗普政府正提议进一步限制移民，辩称工作岗位应该由美国人获得。其他国家可能也会效仿。旅行受到限制，限制了寻找工作、检查工厂和招揽订单的范围。大约90%的人生活在边境基本封闭的国家。许多政府将只对拥有类似健康协议的国家开放:一个类似的“旅游泡沫”正在酝酿中，其中包括澳大利亚和新西兰，也许还有台湾和新加坡(见)。该行业发出的信号表明，旅游中断将是持久的。空客已经削减了三分之一的产量，而全球化的象征阿联酋航空预计在2022年之前都不会恢复生产。</p><p>Trade will suffer as countries abandon the idea that firms and goods are treated equally regardless of where they come from. Governments and central banks are asking taxpayers to underwrite national firms through their stimulus packages, creating a huge and ongoing incentive to favour them. And the push to bring supply chains back home in the name of resilience is accelerating. On May 12th Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, told the nation that a new era of economic self-reliance has begun. Japan’s covid-19 stimulus includes subsidies for firms that repatriate factories; European Union officials talk of “strategic autonomy” and are creating a fund to buy stakes in firms. America is urging Intel to build plants at home. Digital trade is thriving but its scale is still modest. The sales abroad of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are equivalent to just 1.3% of world exports.</p><p>贸易将会受到影响，因为各国放弃了企业和商品无论来自哪里都受到平等对待的想法。政府和中央银行正在要求纳税人通过他们的经济刺激计划为国有企业提供担保，这就产生了一种巨大且持续的支持他们的动机。以恢复力为名将供应链带回国内的努力正在加速。5月12日，印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪(Narendra Modi)向全国宣布，一个经济自力更生的新时代已经开始。日本的covid-19刺激计划包括为将工厂迁回日本的公司提供补贴;欧盟官员谈到了“战略自主权”，并正在创建一个基金来购买公司的股份。美国正敦促英特尔在国内建厂。数字贸易正在蓬勃发展，但其规模仍然不大。亚马逊(Amazon)、苹果(Apple)、Facebook和微软(Microsoft)的海外销售额仅占全球出口额的1.3%。</p><p>The flow of capital is also suffering, as long-term investment sinks. Chinese venture-capital investment in America dropped to $400m in the first quarter of this year, 60% below its level two years ago. Multinational firms may cut their cross-border investment by a third this year. America has just instructed its main federal pension fund to stop buying Chinese shares, and so far this year countries representing 59% of world GDP have tightened their rules on foreign investment. As governments try to pay down their new debts by taxing firms and investors, some countries may be tempted to further restrict the flow of capital across borders.</p><p>随着长期投资的减少，资本流动也受到了影响。今年第一季度，中国在美国的风险投资降至4亿美元，比两年前的水平低了60%。跨国公司今年可能会减少三分之一的跨国投资。美国刚刚指示其主要的联邦养老基金停止购买中国股票，今年到目前为止，占世界GDP 59%的国家已经收紧了对外国投资的规定。当政府试图通过向企业和投资者征税来偿还新债务时，一些国家可能会忍不住进一步限制资本跨境流动。</p><p>It’s lonely out there</p><p>Don’t be fooled that a trading system with an unstable web of national controls will be more humane or safer. Poorer countries will find it harder to catch up and, in the rich world, life will be more expensive and less free. The way to make supply chains more resilient is not to domesticate them, which concentrates risk and forfeits economies of scale, but to diversify them. Moreover, a fractured world will make solving global problems harder, including finding a vaccine and securing an economic recovery.</p><p>外面很寂寞</p><p>不要以为一个由不稳定的国家控制网络组成的贸易体系会更人性化或更安全。贫穷的国家将会发现很难赶上，而在富裕的国家，生活将会更昂贵，更不自由。使供应链更具弹性的方法不是将其驯化，而是使其多样化，因为驯化将集中风险并丧失规模经济。此外，一个分裂的世界将使解决全球性问题更加困难，包括寻找疫苗和确保经济复苏。</p><p>Tragically, this logic is no longer fashionable. Those three body-blows have so wounded the open system of trade that the powerful arguments in its favour are being neglected. Wave goodbye to the greatest era of globalisation—and worry about what is going to take its place</p><p>可悲的是，这种逻辑已不再流行。这三次沉重的打击对开放的贸易体系造成了如此严重的伤害，以至于支持开放贸易体系的有力论据被忽视了。向全球化最伟大的时代挥手告别，并为即将取代它的时代而担忧</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我正站在谷仓旁的废弃红色火车上。风声大作，吹乱我的头发，将凉意送进领口。山边的风更大些，像是山峰在呼吸。往下的山谷则安静平和。与此同时，我家的农场跳起舞来：随着每一阵风吹来，巨大的针叶树缓慢摇摆，灌木丛跟着颤栗、弯腰。在我身后，缓缓向上的山坡绵延到山脚下。如果我抬起头，便可看见黑暗形态的印第安公主.</p><span id="more"></span><p>山坡上长满了野生小麦。若把针叶树与灌木丛看作独奏者，那这麦田便是芭蕾舞团，每个麦秆随着其他部分爆发出一阵阵的运动，在大风吹着金色的麦穗下，百万个芭蕾舞者此起彼伏地弯下腰。麦田凹陷的形状只存在片刻，像是人们看到风一样。</p><p>转向我家山坡上的房子，我看到不同的运动，高大的影子在气流中僵硬移动。我的兄弟们醒了，在测天气。我想象母亲在火炉边正翻着麦麸煎饼。父亲弓着背站在后门，系着钢头靴，把长满老茧的手穿进焊接手套里。下面的高速公路上，校车不停地驶过。</p><p>我只有7岁，但我明白，让我家与众不同是“我们不去上学”这个事实，而不是其他的事。</p><p>我爸担心政府会强迫我们去学校，但事实上并不会，因为政府根本不知道我们。七个孩子中有四个没有出生证明。因为在家里出生并未见过医生与护士，我们没有医疗档案。因为从未踏入进教室，我们没有学校档案。当我9岁时，我将得到一份延期的出生证明，但在此时，根据爱达荷州和联邦政府的说法，我是不存在。</p><p>当然我是存在的。我从小就为可憎的日子作准备，看着太阳下山，看着月亮如染血般下落。夏天，我把桃子装进瓶，冬天，则作食物供应。当这个世界走向尽头，我家依在，不受任何影响。</p><p>我学习于山的韵律，这种韵律的变化不是基本规律，而是一种循环。太阳在每天的早晨中升起，划过山谷，在山峰的背后落下。冬天的雪在春季融化。我们的生活是一个循环，一天的循环，一季的循环。我相信我家是这永恒模式中的一部分，在某种意义，我们是永恒的。但永恒只属于这座山。</p><p>我父亲曾经讲过一个关于这个山峰的故事。她优美古老，是山的大教堂，山中还有其他更高，更壮观的山峰，但巴克的山峰是最精巧的。她的山脚盘延一公里，黑色的形体从地下隆起，上升成一个完美无缺的尖顶。在远处看，你可以看到一个女人的身体印在山上:她的腿由巨大的峡谷构成，她的头发是松树的浪花，在北部的山脊上呈扇形散开。她的姿势是威严的，一条腿大踏步有力地向前伸着。</p><p>我父亲叫她印第安公主。每年雪开始融化时，她都会面朝南出现，看着水牛返回山谷。他说，游牧的印第安人把她的出现，看作是春天到来的标志，预示着冰雪正在融化，冬天已经过去，是时候回家了。</p><p>所有我父亲的故事都是关于山和山谷，还有爱达荷州这块参差不齐的土地。他从未告诉我该怎么做，如果我离开这座山，越过海洋和大陆，在一个陌生的地方找到了自己，在这里我无法在地平线上看到印第安公主。他从未告诉过我，如何知道该什么时候回家。</p><p>除了我妹妹奥黛丽，她小时候摔伤了一个胳膊和一条腿。她被带去打了石膏。</p>]]></content>
