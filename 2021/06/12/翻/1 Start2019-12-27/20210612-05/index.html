<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Zhang kun is the rock star of Chinese fund management. His name often makes headlines; whole articles are dedicated to his investment calls. Investors vie to get into his funds, one of which has reportedly delivered a return of 700% since it was launched eight years ago. He is among a growing number of managers who generate more hype than the firms that employ them. With personalities like Mr Zhang on its payroll, e-Fund, a state-owned investment group, hardly needs to advertise.</p>
<p>Now a swathe of foreign firms hopes to take on Mr Zhang and his ilk by entering China’s asset-management industry. Last month Goldman Sachs, a Wall Street bank, announced a wealth-management venture with icbc, China’s largest commercial lender by assets. BlackRock, a giant American asset manager, will join forces with China Construction Bank (ccb). Amundi, a French firm, has linked up with Bank of China and Schroders, a British investment group, with China’s Bank of Communications. In March JPMorgan Asset Management said it would buy a 10% stake in China Merchant Bank’s wealth business. Nearly 20 global investors are setting up fund-management firms; others are launching private securities funds.</p>
<p>The prize is access to a pot of money worth 120trn yuan ($18.8trn), which includes investments made by everyone from the average saver to the ultra-rich in mutual funds, trusts, wealth and other asset-management products. Though the pool of funds is smaller than in the West—asset managers in North America oversaw $59trn last year, according to pwc, an accounting firm—it is expected to expand rapidly. As more people grow comfortable giving their money to managers instead of picking stocks or buying property, China’s pot could nearly treble, hitting 320trn yuan by 2030, reckons Oliver Wyman, a consultancy (see chart 1). But foreigners’ attempts to crack other parts of China’s financial market have yielded underwhelming results. Could this time be different?</p>
<p>For China’s regulators, the new ventures are a high-stakes experiment meant to transform how savers think about investing. For years retail investors ploughed cash into deposit-like investment products sold and backed by state banks. The principal on such products was considered guaranteed, but the banks funnelled the cash towards high-risk borrowers such as small property developers or coal-mining outfits. By 2016 the banks’ wealth-management arms oversaw around 13% of total banking assets (see chart 2). But regulators cracked down, no longer willing to see banks and ordinary savers exposed to the intensifying risks.</p>
<p>Guaranteed products have been banned. Meanwhile banks’ wealth assets have been spun into new subsidiaries. These must wind down the old deposit-like products and design new ones based on net asset value. In 2020 the new units had 26trn yuan in assets under management, reckons cicc, an investment bank. It is with them that foreign investors have been invited to establish joint ventures.</p>
<p>The call sounds familiar. Foreign financiers have been knocking at China’s door for generations, with an eye to every corner of the industry, from retail banking to securities. In 1995 ccb and Morgan Stanley, another Wall Street bank, set up cicc; in 2004 Goldman was allowed to establish the first foreign securities joint venture. But when you look back over the past two decades, the developments seem underwhelming and the returns meagre.</p>
<p>That was largely because China opened up only when home-grown firms were big enough to withstand competition. Some foreign retail banks launched gung-ho expansion plans only to quit the market later, defeated by domestic giants’ extensive branch networks. Securities joint ventures have taken more than a decade to pass majority control to foreign investors. Payments firms such as Visa and Mastercard were shut out until mobile payments became dominant and competition futile.</p>
<p>Wealth management could be different. For one, the foreigners do not face a mature market with insurmountable competition. Regulators’ sweeping reforms mean that they are in fact entering what could become the world’s largest market for retail wealth at an early stage.</p>
<p>This is evident in the financial products on offer today. China’s mutual-fund industry has grown at a fantastic pace in recent years. Many firms now oversee 1trn yuan in assets. Money-market funds are ubiquitous. But product design is still in its infancy. Global firms are expected to bring a new level of sophistication. Tuan Lam of Goldman says his group will offer quantitative products such as algorithmic and factor-based strategies, and cross-border and alternative-asset investments. “These are not present in China right now,” he notes.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the joint ventures is their links to China’s largest financial firms. The banks and their tens of thousands of branches were key intermediaries during the first era of wealth management and, say experts, may also define the next. Their wealth-management subsidiaries have vast portfolios and huge numbers of clients. Take ccb. It has more than 14,700 branches; last year it managed 2.2trn yuan in wealth-management products and attracted more than 4.4m new investment and wealth-management clients. Access to customers is “one of the benefits of partnering with one of the largest banks in China”, says Susan Chan of BlackRock.</p>
<p>Yet success will depend on foreigners’ ability to establish and market themselves. Goldman and BlackRock have some name recognition in China by virtue of their size. Amundi and Schroders, by contrast, are unknown outside financial circles. And teaming up with home-grown banks has some downsides. A potential customer at a bank branch will be offered a suite of products, which will include those designed and branded by the joint ventures, but also those designed solely by the bank. Online, joint-venture offerings will probably appear on smartphone apps on a list of commoditised products. The foreign groups will therefore have to make sure their offering is advertised sufficiently to clients—no easy task given that tens of thousands of banks’ relationship managers will be responsible for sales. It can be done, but only with hefty investment in staff training, says Philip Leung of Bain, a consultancy.</p>
<p>Another problem is competing with superstars such as Mr Zhang, who often manage money for giant mutual funds. Financial news in China is abuzz with stories on the performance of star managers. Many retail investors make decisions based on such information. Few clients are interested in a fund’s risk controls, notes Fabrice Maraval, an executive who has worked at two Sino-foreign financial ventures. Instead, they ask, “What’s your ranking on the list of top fund managers?”, he says.</p>
<p>Executives at several joint ventures bristle at the idea of hiring stars who market their funds. “It’s just not our culture,” says one. Instead they must slowly build trust with clients through solid performance and prudent risk controls. Zhong Xiaofeng of Amundi describes his group’s strategy in China as a “long-haul effort”. If foreigners are to give the stars a run for their money, it will have to be. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Eric zhu, an international sales manager at a Chinese forklift-maker, has just sent his second letter of the year to customers, explaining that prices are going up once again. “We need to share some of the price increases with our partners. We cannot absorb them all ourselves,” he says. “The world is crazy now.” Although not standard economics terminology, crazy is a good description for the price movements now coursing through global markets. Inflation in America is running at its fastest since 2008. Energy and commodity prices have soared. And as Mr Zhu can attest, investors and company bosses are worried that China, the world’s workshop, is itself starting to export inflation.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why people are concerned. On June 9th China reported that factory-gate prices rose at an annual rate of 9% in May, the highest in more than a decade. That, along with soaring shipping costs and a stronger yuan, will probably push up the prices of made-in-China goods, from phones to futons. America’s imports from China already cost 2.1% more in April than they did a year ago, the fastest rise since 2012 (see chart).</p>
<p>Yet the danger of China-exported inflation can be overplayed. Only part of the rise in China’s producer prices reflects domestic causes. Its strong economic recovery was led by investment in homes and infrastructure, which pushed up the price of steel. In order to meet green targets, the government has reined in both coal and steel production. Officials have also vowed to crack down on “excessive speculation” in domestic commodity futures, suggesting that this helped the run-up in prices.</p>
<p>Most of the price pressures instead reflect the peculiarities of the covid-clouded world. The global demand for consumer goods—things you can buy online while confined at home—has soared. Chinese exports are about 20% higher than their pre-pandemic trend, and factories have struggled to keep up with orders. Disruptions to global commodity supplies, such as lockdowns that limited copper mining in Chile and Peru, have also pushed up prices.</p>
<p>Rather than transmit the shock, Chinese companies have absorbed much of it. Compared with the end of 2019, before covid-19 upended the world, factory-gate prices in China have risen by nearly 6%. But an index measuring the cost of manufactured consumer goods in China went up by just 0.6%. Companies have had to get by with thinner margins. No wonder Mr Zhu wants to share the pain with customers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the policy environments in China and America are very different. Whereas the Federal Reserve eased monetary policy dramatically, the People’s Bank of China was much more conservative. It has cautiously begun tapering its support. This may help explain the divergence between the two countries’ inflation trajectories. In America, the Fed’s preferred measure of “core” consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 3.1% year-on-year in April, the most since 1992. In China, the core index rose by just 0.9% year-on-year in May. (China’s farmers have also helped quell inflation. A recovery in pig stocks after an outbreak of African swine fever has brought pork prices down by nearly a quarter compared with last year.)</p>
<p>Taking a longer view, some analysts think that China’s ageing population will transform it into an inflationary force. In the early 2000s, China’s low wages helped make consumer goods cheap around the world. That suggests that shrinking labour supply and rising wages should have the opposite effect. Yet this is not so clear-cut. Low-end manufacturing is already moving to cheaper places like Vietnam and Bangladesh, while a rapid increase in automation in China has also helped restrain prices.</p>
<p>Now, though, the pressing question is whether China’s input-price inflation will be transitory or more enduring. The answer lies outside China. As the vaccine roll-out gains traction and something closer to normal life resumes in America and Europe, people are likely to spend more on services such as tourism and eating out, not just on goods bought online. That would ease the pressure on commodities and, by extension, on China’s factories. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Sit by bar Pisellino, a chic watering hole in the West Village, a swanky neighbourhood in Manhattan, and the world seems to have righted itself. Patrons munch on fat green olives and sip fizzy aperitifs as they watch well-heeled shoppers, newly returned to the streets, go by.</p>
<p>Just across the street, however, an empty shopfront crumbles from neglect. Despite ample government support during the pandemic many business owners cut their losses, terminated their leases and closed down, pushing retail vacancies in New York to new highs. Fully 13% of shopfronts in the West Village are vacant, compared with 1.9% in 2007 and 8.2% in 2017, according to data compiled by Scott Stringer, the city’s comptroller and now a candidate for mayor. The story is the same across most of Manhattan. Though activity is now resuming, it may be some time before the shopfronts return to life.</p>
<p>Retail rents have fallen sharply: in some neighbourhoods, like SoHo, they have dropped by more than 20% since 2019. That should make spaces more affordable—and attractive—to prospective tenants. But there is still a mismatch between what landlords and tenants want. Though it is costly for residential tenants to move, they rarely have to incur the expense of building a kitchen or a bathroom when they arrive. Retail tenants and their landlords, by contrast, can spend a fortune turning a space into a restaurant or a boutique. To make this worthwhile, leases often span a decade or longer. In a downturn, landlords want to sign shorter leases in the hope that rents will soon recover. Tenants, however, are unwilling, fearing that landlords may jack up the rent once they have gone to the trouble of fitting out the space.</p>
<p>An added complication comes from structural shifts in shoppers’ habits. Many observers, including Mr Stringer, reckon that the rise of online shopping explains why vacancy rates were rising even before the pandemic. The continued trend may lead landlords to accept that rents could stay low for a while. But faced with the uncertainty of whether a retailer will survive or not, they may prefer to wait for the right sort of tenant. “If you find the market-clearing rent for a shop, do the tenant improvements with them, sign a ten-year lease and then 24 months later they go bankrupt, are you really any better off?”, says Don Mullen, the founder of Pretium, a property- and mortgage-investment firm. Many commercial landlords want “Amazon-proof” tenants, like nail salons and salad bars, rather than retailers.</p>
<p>Even if landlords are willing to sign a lease with a lower rent, those with a commercial mortgage can find their hands tied. “Lenders often include covenants in their loan agreements,” says Dan Rosenbloom of Cadre, another investment firm. These might stipulate that the rent must at least cover the interest owed. If landlords want to sign a lease with a lower rent the lender might let them sign it, says Mr Rosenbloom, but they might require the borrower to stump up the cash to reduce the loan balance. That can make rents sticky, even if there is lots of vacant space.</p>
<p>The queues snaking around the corner of Magnolia Bakery and the throngs browsing in the pricey shops along Bleecker Street suggest that there is no shortage of demand for cute bakeries and boutiques in the West Village. But that does not mean the empty properties next door will be snapped up soon. </p>

<p>Miami is the mecca of anti-establishment finance. Or so it seemed on June 4th and 5th, when 12,000 people clad in everything from flannel suits to festival gear and whale-shaped hats descended on the world’s biggest bitcoin conference. On stage crypto gurus such as Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s boss, praised those striving for fortune and freedom. The crowd erupted when Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, announced plans to make bitcoin legal tender. (On June 9th lawmakers approved his proposal.) “This is not a moment,” beamed the mayor of Miami. “This is a movement.”</p>
<p>The movement is far from its destination. Now in its 13th year, bitcoin has become an investment sensation. But, Mr Bukele’s enthusiasm aside, it remains a poor and hardly used medium of exchange. A host of smaller cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are rushing in. Fully 10,000 are listed on CoinMarketCap, a website, nearly twice as many as a year ago. Bitcoin accounts for 40% of the total value of all cryptocurrencies today, compared with 70% in January. Elon Musk, an electric-car tycoon whose tweets seem to make the weather in crypto markets, says he now favours younger rivals. Could one of them steal bitcoin’s crown?</p>
<p>Most do not want to. Many listed on exchanges are “tokens”, which can become tools of speculation but, in contrast to “coins”, do not aspire to the full functions of money. The purpose of “security” tokens, like that of stocks and bonds, is investment: they represent ownership in firms or other assets, recorded on a distributed ledger. “Utility” tokens, meanwhile, are tradable credits that can be bought and used in exchange for a service. Crypto exchanges, for example, sell tokens that punters use to pay transaction fees.</p>
<p>That still leaves 779 coins. Many are tiny: just 110 have a market capitalisation exceeding $100m. Some are fads and will prove fleeting. The more serious contenders fall into two categories: the “bitcoin clones” seek to fix the cryptocurrency’s flaws as a means of payment; and the “ether clones” aim to perform new functions.</p>
<p>Consider the bitcoin clones first. One problem with bitcoin is its volatility: in the space of a few hours on May 19th, for instance, prices fell by 30%. To avoid such swings, so-called “stablecoins” track government-issued (or “fiat”, in the crypto-lingo) currencies instead.</p>
<p>Other clones try to fix bitcoin’s privacy problems. Since all bitcoin transactions are recorded on its blockchain, which is public, they leave a trail. On June 7th American officials said they had recovered $2.3m-worth of a ransom paid in bitcoin to the hackers who shut down the Colonial Pipeline in May, after identifying the virtual wallet they had used. Some coins try to provide greater anonymity by using masking tech. Monero, for instance, tries to make it hard to link flows to a fixed identity, trace funds or observe transaction size.</p>
<p>Still other clones try to make payments cheaper and quicker to process. To ensure that transactions are legitimate without relying on a central authority, bitcoin relies on a system called “proof of work”, where “miners” compete to validate blocks of transactions by solving time-consuming numerical problems. Yet bitcoin’s design is such that it can handle only around seven transactions per second. The creator of Litecoin therefore tweaked the algorithm so that new blocks are processed more often. Dogecoin, a coin that was developed as a joke and which often features in Mr Musk’s tweets, has no cap on its supply.</p>
<p>More radical alternatives, such as Cardano and Tron, have switched to “proof of stake”, under which validators are rewarded in proportion to the number of coins they lock into an escrow wallet while transactions are verified. The process involves less hardware and fewer energy costs.</p>
<p>But for every flaw that the clones try to fix, a desirable attribute of bitcoin seems to be lost. Stablecoins, for instance, require users to trust both the issuer (which must hold hard cash in reserve) and a government, defeating crypto’s original anarchic aims. Some may not be trustworthy. In February the issuer of Tether, the biggest, was fined $18.5m by authorities in New York for lying about its dollar stash.</p>
<p>Big exchanges have delisted the ultra-private Monero, fearing its potential for money-laundering. Dogecoin is even more volatile than bitcoin. The proof-of-stake system, meanwhile, encourages hoarding, limiting liquidity. It also favours concentration, which goes against decentralisation, says Eswar Prasad of Cornell University. These trade-offs may be why none of the clones has come close to overtaking bitcoin (see table). According to analysts at Brave New Coin, a research firm, alternative measures, such as activity on GitHub, a platform used by programmers to collaborate on projects, show that bitcoin remains uniquely popular.</p>
<p>The threat comes instead from currencies with nimbler blockchains that can do more than record payments. Ethereum, which hosts ether, the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, can execute automated programmes that, for example, move money between wallets only after a specific event. Ether and its clones have become central to the budding field of decentralised finance (DeFi), where “smart contracts” replicate sophisticated financial transactions, such as making loans or offering insurance, without a trusted intermediary. That is boosting adoption. Over the past 12 months DeFi drove 40% of ether transactions, up from 7% in the previous period, reckons Chainalysis, a data firm.</p>
<p>With around $59bn in capital deposited in its applications, DeFi remains small. But it is growing fast, and bitcoin, with a blockchain that cannot accommodate smart contracts, is ill-equipped to ride the wave. Its first-mover advantage and scarcity make bitcoin likely to remain attractive as a speculative asset. Yet that could prove poor consolation. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>At midnight on August 31st 1602, the public offering of shares in a new kind of enterprise closed. The charter for the venture, the Dutch East India Company, granted it a monopoly on trade with Asia until 1623, at which time, it was assumed, the firm would be liquidated. Twenty-one years is a long wait for capital to be returned. Smaller maritime ventures were generally wound up and the spoils divided after three or four years, when (and if) the ships returned. So shareholders were given an option to cash out after ten years. It hardly mattered. A faster exit route soon opened up.</p>
<p>The merchants who gathered daily around Amsterdam’s New Bridge to trade spices and grain proved as willing to buy and sell shares. These developments are recounted in “The World’s First Stock Exchange”, by Lodewijk Petram, a historian. One of the book’s many lessons is that wherever there is a primary market for a new kind of asset, there will soon be a secondary market.</p>
<p>There is a modern-day analogue in the treatment of stakes in private-equity funds. The limited partners in such ventures—the pension schemes and sovereign-wealth funds that provide capital—are in principle committed for the life of the fund, which is usually ten years or longer. The reality is different. A thriving market in “secondaries”, negotiated sales of limited-partner stakes, has emerged as private equity has matured. Today’s private-equity investors are no more locked-in to their commitments than were the Amsterdam burghers of four centuries ago.</p>
<p>Secondary markets are first prompted by asset-holders who really need the cash. The earliest sales in Amsterdam’s stockmarket were usually by merchants who could not pay the promised subscription. In private equity the early secondary transactions were typically distressed sales. They were often struck at biggish discounts—25% or more—to the appraised value of the assets in the fund.</p>
<p>Over time the stigma to selling out has disappeared: in 2019 around $85bn worth of stakes changed hands. These days the reason for the sale of a stake is often strategic. It might be to rebalance portfolios by geography, industry or vintage for reasons of risk management, say, or to reduce the number of relationships with the general partners of private-equity firms. A lot of limited partners simply wish to manage their private assets as actively as their listed ones. Often funds will sell for more than the appraised value of the companies in the portfolio.</p>
<p>Over the past decade there has been a trend towards secondary transactions led by general partners, says Andrew Sealey of Campbell Lutyens, an advisory firm. It might be that a ten-year fund is about to expire whose general partners do not want to sell the portfolio of companies, because the time is not propitious for a good exit price. Some of the limited partners will need their money back, though.</p>
<p>The solution is a continuation fund. An example was Nordic Capital VII, a fund set up in 2008, which transferred its nine portfolio companies into a €2.5bn ($3bn) continuation fund in 2018. A price was set by auction. Investors had a choice of selling their stakes at a premium to appraised value or staying in for five more years. Most opted to stay in.</p>
<p>The burgeoning trade in secondaries has been underpinned by the rapid growth of specialist funds. Twenty years ago there were just a handful; now there are dozens. Five of the ten largest private pools of capital raised last year were for specialist secondary funds.</p>
<p>The secondary market attracts big fund managers who want to offer their clients the full range of assets, including private ones. For a start, it looks a lot less crowded than the primary business. “Anyone can set up a buyout fund,” says one fund manager. Funds often compete to buy the same companies. In a secondary fund, by contrast, there is a better chance of profiting from expertise. It requires knowledgeable analysts and good information-gathering to appraise a stake in a portfolio of companies when it comes up for sale. The general partners have the right of approval over buyers of secondhand stakes. These are high barriers for would-be rivals to clear.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the flourishing of the shorter-term secondary market has allowed the formal time horizon of private-equity funds to extend almost to infinity. In this, as in other ways, private equity is following 17th-century Amsterdam. At its outset the Dutch East India Company was supposed to have a limited lifespan. It was still going almost two centuries later.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>America’s latest jobs reports landed with resounding thuds. Upbeat Wall Street forecasters had expected firms to add 1m new jobs in April. Employers made them look foolish, taking on just under 300,000 new workers instead. Punters lowered their expectations for May but still wound up disappointed, when on June 4th the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported net employment growth of just 559,000: a decent showing in normal times, but unsatisfying when millions remain out of work. Underwhelming job gains look increasingly mysterious given firms’ desperation to hire. With roughly one job vacancy available for every person out of work, you would think that America’s labour-market problems could be solved soon enough. But a leisurely pace of jobs growth does not necessarily indicate that the economic recovery has gone wrong. A deeper dive into the figures suggests that it could simply reflect the difficulties of matching millions of workers with jobs at a time of unprecedented economic flux.</p>
<p>On the surface, the American jobs market does appear to be behaving oddly. The economy is unquestionably booming. Real output rose at an annualised pace of 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021 and is projected to have grown at an annualised clip of nearly 10% in the second. Firms are keen to hire. The 9.3m job openings posted in April were easily the most on record. Employers—some, at least—are attempting to lure workers with generous pay. Though overall wage growth remains subdued, rates of pay for newly hired workers are soaring in the service-sector occupations that are suffering most from labour shortages. In the first quarter of this year, the real wage for new hires in such positions (say, in restaurants or hair salons) stood about 8% above the level you might have expected them to earn before the pandemic, according to a recent analysis by Julie Hotchkiss of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. And faster job gains are certainly within the realms of possibility: employment rose by nearly 5m in June 2020, and by nearly 11m over a four-month stretch in the middle of last year.</p>
<p>Look closely, though, and the picture becomes both less mysterious and more complicated. Last year’s rapid rebound reflected the unique nature of the pandemic recession. Employers shed a staggering 22m jobs in March and April 2020, but about 80% of the unemployed at that time were temporarily laid off, with a job to which they expected to be recalled once lockdowns eased. (During the Great Recession, by contrast, temporary lay-offs never accounted for more than 15% of all unemployment.) When firms began to reopen, the temporarily unemployed could immediately resume work; their ranks have plunged by 16m since April last year, or by about 90%, contributing to a staggering decline in the jobless rate of about nine percentage points. But there are ever fewer temporarily laid-off workers waiting to be brought back (see chart, left panel). Meanwhile, workers who have permanently lost their jobs, who made up just 9% of the unemployed early in the pandemic, now represent about a third of all those out of work.</p>
<p>This shift in the composition of unemployment probably means that joblessness cannot fall as quickly as it did last year. The rise in unemployment in a recession is often much more rapid than the speed with which it goes on to fall during the recovery. This asymmetry stems in part from the fact that the creation of a new job (as opposed to the resumption of an old one) involves time-consuming matchmaking, as worker and firm try to find each other. Congestion among the unemployed can slow this process. Recent work by Niklas Engbom of New York University documents that an unemployed person applies for more than ten times as many jobs each month as an employed worker, but is nonetheless less than half as likely, per application, to start a new job. So though there may be a vacancy open for each jobless worker today, employers bombarded with applications must take time to find a candidate they like, delaying the moment at which the opening is filled (or lengthening the time taken to fill the job, if the chosen applicant in the meantime accepts another offer).</p>
<p>Churn, churn, churn<br>In addition, note Robert Hall of Stanford University and Marianna Kudlyak of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the road from unemployment to a permanent job match may include more than one round of searching. Workers seeking employment often cycle through short-term jobs before finding a long-term match, which helps explain why the pace at which individual unemployed jobseekers find work is faster than that at which aggregate unemployment returns to normal.</p>
<p>Though tepid headline jobs figures seem a cause for worry, there is plenty of healthy churn taking place behind the scenes, as another survey indicates. Over the first five months of 2021 an average of 2.4m workers have moved from unemployment to employment each month. Joblessness has not fallen by more over this period only because some workers have moved in the other direction, while others are newly classified as unemployed after rejoining the labour force. Though net employment growth might not show it, hiring is robust. In April employers took on more than 6m workers—the most on record, barring the period of reopening last summer. In the same month 5.8m workers left jobs, including 4m who chose to depart voluntarily (see chart, right panel). The increasing number of people quitting their jobs suggests that workers are using a moment of high labour demand and generous wage offers to find better opportunities. This adds to the strain on human-resources departments in the short run, further preventing jobless Americans from rushing back to work. But it is also a sign of confidence in the economic recovery.</p>
<p>A prolonged period of elevated involuntary unemployment undoubtedly carries risks. But sub-million monthly payroll reports are not for the moment cause for much worry. America remains on track to eliminate remaining pandemic unemployment within two years. And in the meantime, the churning of workers into new, different jobs could leave the economy more productive than before, and better equipped for a post-pandemic world. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>NEWS THAT America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted conditional approval to a new drug, aducanumab, to be marketed as Aduhelm, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, has understandably been greeted as a huge breakthrough. For millions of people with Alzheimer’s, a remorselessly degenerative illness leading eventually to utter helplessness—and for those caring for them—it is a ray of hope. But the benefits it will offer remain uncertain, and the FDA’s decision is controversial.</p>
<p>It was 115 years ago that Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist, conducted the autopsy that helped him identify the disease now known as Alzheimer’s. It is much the most common of the dozens of causes of dementia. It accounts for 60-80% of cases of a debilitating condition that affects an estimated 50m people around the world, and—as the risk of dementia increases with age, and the world is getting older—is spreading fast. The costs in human misery are incalculable. In terms of expenditure in caring for people with the condition, they are estimated at over $1trn now, and forecast to reach $2trn by 2030.</p>
<p>So even if few have hoped for an imminent cure there is huge pent-up demand for a treatment that at least slows the advance of Alzheimer’s. The FDA claims in its press release on the approval sought by Biogen, a biotechnology firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts: “Aduhelm is the first treatment directed at the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease.” In November 2019 China granted conditional approval to Oligomannate (gv-971), a drug produced by Green Valley, a company from Shanghai. But Western scientists grumbled the data from the Chinese study were scanty and its conclusions hard to credit.</p>
<p>So the jubilation in some quarters at Biogen’s coup is understandable. But it is not universal, in part because of the tortuous history of the drug’s progress to approval. It is of a type known as a monoclonal antibody—a specialised protein molecule forming part of the immune system—tailored to bind to a protein called beta-amyloid, which forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and which many researchers have long believed is not just a symptom of Alzheimer’s but at least part of the cause (an idea known as “the amyloid hypothesis”). Aducanumab does, indeed, seem to reduce the amount of beta-amyloid in the brain. That is why the FDA has approved it. The theory is that this should, in turn, slow the progress of cognitive degeneration. On that point, the evidence is less clear-cut. The FDA approval allows the drug to be used but requires Biogen to carry out a large-scale clinical trial to prove that it does indeed work, and warns that if not, it could be “pulled from the market”.</p>
<p>Previous efforts to demonstrate its efficacy appeared to have foundered in March 2019, when Biogen and Eisai of Japan announced that they were ending two clinical trials among people with signs of mild cognitive impairment or early-onset Alzheimer’s. Aducanumab had failed a “futility test”—ie, the evidence suggested it had no effect. But then, in October that year, Biogen said a fresh look at the data showed that “patients…experienced significant benefits on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation and language.” One of the two trials, it said, showed that higher doses of the drug did have a small but noticeable effect in slowing cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s. Biogen said it would seek FDA approval after all.</p>
<p>A drug prescribed to even a substantial minority of people with dementia would be among the biggest-sellers of all time. The price of Biogen’s shares, which had fallen by almost 30% on the day of its announcement that trials had failed, bounced back almost as much when it changed its mind, and surged again a year later when the FDA made positive comments, as well as after its announcement today. Administered intravenously, monthly, at a clinic, aducanumab is likely at first to cost thousands of dollars a year, and patients will require constant monitoring as many develop brain oedemas.</p>
<p>Many specialists remain deeply sceptical about aducanumab in particular, and the amyloid hypothesis more broadly. Last November ten out of the 11 members of an expert advisory panel appointed by the FDA voted against approving the drug on the basis of the research presented (the 11th was undecided). More recently, a new statistical study of various drug trials in Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia, the journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, a charity, shows what one of its authors, Edo Richard, a Dutch neurologist, calls “overwhelming evidence of absence of an effect of anti-amyloid therapy in general”. Dr Richard finds it “amazing” that the FDA has overruled its own advisory panel to reach the “scientifically questionable” ruling on the drug.</p>
<p>His paper argues that the time has come to divert therapeutic efforts away from drugs that try to clear beta-amyloid to other lines of investigation. And, for all the scepticism about this drug, some scientists in the field are optimistic that great progress is being made in combating dementia. Jonathan Schott, a professor of neurology at the Dementia Research Centre, University College, London, and chief medical officer of Alzheimer’s Research, says that 30-40% of the causes of dementia are modifiable. Already there is evidence that the age-specific incidence of dementia is going down in the West as people live healthier lives: obesity, smoking, high blood pressure and excessive drinking in middle age are all associated with a higher incidence of dementia. A study published last year in Neurology followed nearly 50,000 people in America and Europe from 1988 to 2015. It found that 8.6% developed dementia. But the risk of being among them had, remarkably, fallen by an average of about 13% a decade, from about a one-in-four chance for a 75-year-old in 1995 to less than one in five.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, great advances have been made in diagnosing dementia. Whereas once this required cognitive tests followed by an expensive brain scan or intrusive lumbar puncture, now a simple blood test can predict, decades in advance, how likely it is that someone will develop Alzheimer’s later in life. Identifying those at risk early means that existing therapies, including aducanumab, largely ineffective once symptoms are far advanced, might be deployed early enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>And other treatments should, slowly, become available. James Rowe, a professor of cognitive neurology at Cambridge, believes research into dementia is at a “tipping-point”. He expects the first successes with rare genetic conditions such as Huntington’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. Alzheimer’s, which may turn out to be an umbrella term for a variety of different contributory pathologies, susceptible to different medicines, would follow later. Those living with Alzheimer’s have had few reasons for optimism. And Professor Schott argues that the main benefit of the FDA ruling may be that Alzheimer’s will no longer be seen as a “lost cause”. Big pharma and publicly funded researchers will take encouragement. Aducanumab offers a small step forward; bigger ones will come.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Since handing over the reins as Microsoft’s chief executive in 2000, Bill Gates has been best-known for his philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest charities, has given billions of dollars to vaccination drives, family-planning clinics, research into drug treatments for malaria and more.</p>
<p>But Mr Gates has not abandoned the business world entirely. On June 2nd TerraPower, a company he founded in 2008, announced that it would build a demonstration of an exotic, high-tech nuclear power station in Wyoming. The firm’s Natrium reactor is one of a gaggle of new designs that have emerged in recent years, as engineers try to come up with cheaper, simpler nuclear power plants that can provide low-carbon electricity with fewer of the cost and safety worries that have plagued the industry in the past.</p>
<p>The Natrium reactor makes two big changes to the standard nuclear-power-plant design. It replaces the liquid water that normally courses through the core with hot, liquid sodium (natrium, in Latin). And instead of using the heat generated by the reactor to make electricity directly, it first employs it to heat a tank of molten salt that acts as a giant battery. The upshot, the firm hopes, will be a cheaper reactor that is better suited to power grids that will increasingly be dominated by intermittent sources of energy such as wind turbines and solar panels.</p>
<p>Start with the reactor itself. Most nuclear power plants are light-water reactors (lwrs), a technology developed in America in the 1950s. They use ordinary water both to cool the reactor core and to increase the intensity of the chain-reaction by moderating the speed of the neutrons that are emitted when uranium atoms split. Thus slowed, these neutrons are more likely to go on to split more atoms in turn.</p>
<p>Natrium employs hot, liquid sodium as a coolant, and dispenses with the moderator entirely. This is another idea that dates back to the 1950s, but one which has never been widely deployed. Yet sodium offers several advantages as a coolant, says Chris Levesque, TerraPower’s boss. The liquid sodium’s high temperature—around 500°C—makes the reactor more efficient. At the same time, liquid sodium is much less corrosive to pipes than hot water. And though the water in lwrs is pumped through at high pressure, Natrium is designed to operate at close to atmospheric pressure. That means pipes, containment buildings and the like can be less beefy without affecting safety. TerraPower reckons its reactor needs only 20% of the concrete required by an lwr of equivalent power, which helps keep down costs.</p>
<p>The firm’s second big idea is its molten-salt energy-storage system. Inspiration for this came from the solar-power industry, says Mr Levesque. Solar-thermal systems (in contradistinction to the more familiar photovoltaic ones that generate electricity directly) have, for several years, used similar tanks to store excess solar energy harvested during the day. In Natrium’s case, the sodium coolant transfers heat from the reactor into the molten-salt tanks. A separate set of pipes then removes heat from the tanks and uses it to produce electricity.</p>
<p>TerraPower hopes this arrangement will let the new reactor ramp its power output up and down, depending on the price of electricity. This is something that lwrs struggle to do. The firm’s demonstration plant will usually produce 345 megawatts (mw) of electrical power. But by releasing the energy stored in the molten-salt tanks, it will be able to boost that to 500mw for over five-and-a-half hours. This should be a useful trick as power grids fill up with wind and solar farms that are likely to cause power prices to fluctuate more than they do at present. Combined with lower construction costs, TerraPower hopes such agility will make its plant more economically attractive than older designs.</p>
<p>It all looks good on paper. But then, nuclear power always does. The industry has been plagued by delays and cost overruns for decades. Existing sodium-cooled reactors, most of which are experimental, have a spotty record. A plant in Japan suffered a serious fire in 1995 and was shut down for over a decade. The Superphénix reactor in France, built in 1974, proved extremely unreliable, and was offline for years at a time. It closed for good in 1998. (Other reactors, such as the Fast Flux Test Facility in Washington state, have better records.)</p>
<p>The Union of Concerned Scientists, an American not-for-profit organisation, argues in a report published in March that sodium’s advantages as a coolant are counterbalanced by drawbacks. One is that a reactor which ran too hot might see its power output rise as a consequence. Unlike water, the loss of which shuts a reactor down for lack of moderation, sodium slightly damps the chain-reaction. If bubbles of sodium vapour formed in the coolant, that damping effect would diminish, risking a dangerous feedback loop of rising temperatures and growing power output.</p>
<p>The physics of such judgments are tricky. Few countries have as much nuclear experience as France, which generates around 70% of its electricity that way. Yet in 2015 French regulators said they could not determine whether sodium-cooled reactors are significantly safer than modern lwrs. TerraPower, moreover, insists that its Natrium plant is designed in a way that makes runaway reactions impossible.</p>
<p>America’s government, for its part, thinks the technology has merit. It is chipping in $80m to help TerraPower build the demonstration plant, which the firm says should be ready by 2028. In the meantime, says Mr Levesque, TerraPower has been fielding inquiries from electricity firms interested in its technology. Whether Mr Gates’s bet on a nuclear-power revival will pay off remains to be seen. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>On the face of things, the Laysan albatross is doing fairly well. Its population is estimated at around 1.6m, and may be growing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (iucn) classifies it as “near-threatened”, putting it on the second rung from the bottom of the organisation’s seven-rung ladder to extinction. A cause for moderate concern. But not, you may think, something that should be top of conservationists’ lists of priorities. However, like another reasonably abundant migratory species, the monarch butterfly, the Laysan albatross has an Achilles heel.</p>
<p>Though monarchs range across much of North America, many are, or are the descendants of, insects that have roosted over winter in the same few groves of trees in central Mexico. Destroy those trees and you would imperil the species. The Laysan albatross has a similar vulnerability. Adult birds traverse much of the Pacific Ocean. But more than 90% of them started life on one of two specks of land, Midway and the eponymous Laysan, which are among the most north-westerly members of the Hawaiian archipelago. Wipe out those breeding colonies and the Laysan albatross would shoot right up the iucn ladder.</p>
<p>And that is just what some ornithologists fear, for both Midway and Laysan, which are among the oldest parts of the Hawaiian chain, have been eroded over time from their original splendour as mountainous volcanic islands to their current state as coral atolls protruding a few metres above sea level. A storm surge in 2011 destroyed hundreds of thousands of nests, and even in normal years thousands are thus lost. Rising sea levels may make this worse. Time, then, to spread the species’ risk by establishing Laysan-albatross colonies elsewhere.</p>
<p>A project to do so began in 2015 when America’s navy, its Fish and Wildlife Service (a government agency) and several private conservation organisations led by a group called Pacific Rim Conservation began collaborating to move albatross eggs from another member of the archipelago, Kauai, which supports a small colony of the birds, to Oahu, home of Hawaii’s capital, Honolulu. Here, after incubation and hatching, they are transferred to a wildlife refuge ten metres above sea level, and hand-fed squid and fish for five months until they fledge and leave the island.</p>
<p>While there, they are exposed to fibreglass decoys and solar-powered megaphones that broadcast albatross calls. The hope is that these tricks will encourage the chicks to imprint on the area and come there to breed as adults. Since young Laysans spend three to five years at sea before returning to their birthplace for the first time, it has taken a while to discover whether that works. But the auspices seem reasonably good. Of the 46 Laysans successfully raised and fledged from the 2015, 2016 and 2017 breeding seasons, seven have so far returned. And, as a bonus, the decoy birds and calls have also attracted hundreds of adult Laysan albatross visitors, including four pairs that have begun to nest.</p>
<p>There are caveats. The transfer of eggs from Kauai was a proof of principle rather than a true conservation effort. Kauai is not an atoll, and the nests in question were chosen because they were too close for comfort to a navy airfield there. More seriously, there is the question of protecting the albatrosses if they do establish themselves on Oahu. The probable reason why so many of the birds now nest on Midway and Laysan rather than on larger islands is lack of predators. Small rodents, introduced by human visitors, were a problem on both places (though they have been eliminated from Laysan). Oahu, though, is rife not only with these, but also with larger imported predators. The albatross sanctuary is therefore surrounded by a fence two metres high that keeps out cats, dogs and pigs, and which is also dug into the ground to stop rodents burrowing under it. The 6.5 hectares of land thus fortified could accommodate several tens of thousands of pairs of nesting birds. As Jared Underwood of the Fish and Wildlife Service puts it, “We’re just allowing them to come back.” But that permission depends on the fortifications being maintained.</p>
<p>Nothing daunted, though, the project’s partners are now expanding. They have taken to accommodating black-footed albatross, a related species with similar habits, on Oahu as well. These have been translocated from both Midway and another atoll, Tern Island. And the partners are also trying to establish colonies far away from the Hawaiian Islands, on the Channel Islands off the coast of California and on Guadalupe, off the coast of Mexico. If things go well, then, the Laysan-albatross conservation project may prove a rare example of shutting the stable door before the horse has bolted. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Sharks may not be the best-loved creatures on Earth, but they are an important part of marine ecology and many of the larger species are in serious decline. That threat, though, may be nothing compared with what happened 19m years ago, during the Miocene epoch—for then, it seems, the whole group came perilously close to extinction.</p>
<p>The fossil record is a patchy reflection of the past, and rocks from the deep ocean, in particular, only rarely end up on dry land, and thus accessible to the palaeontologist’s hammer. Recent decades have, however, seen a number of drilling expeditions which have collected samples from the ooze that accumulates on the ocean floor. And a few years ago Elizabeth Sibert, a palaeoecologist now at Yale University, came up with a clever way to use these to gain information about life in the seas of the past. This was to look at microscopic, mineral-rich objects shed by sharks (mainly bits of protective skin-covering, known as denticles, pictured) and bony fish (mainly teeth). Counting and classifying these so-called ichthyoliths gives a sense of both the abundance and the diversity of the animals in question.</p>
<p>Her latest investigation of the matter has yielded a shock. She and Leah Rubin, of the State University of New York, have been perusing two sediment cores collected thousands of kilometres apart in the north and the south of the Pacific Ocean. As they write in Science, they discovered that, in a span of at most 100,000 years, the ratio of shark denticles to bony-fish teeth changed radically. Before this geological eyeblink, both cores yielded about one denticle for every five teeth—a ratio that had been stable for 40m years. After it, that ratio dropped to one to 100.</p>
<p>The mixture of denticles changed, too. Modern shark species often have only one or two types of denticle, and these can be characteristic of the species or family in question, so it is reasonable to assume that something similar pertained during the Miocene. Dr Sibert and Ms Rubin saw a 70% reduction in the number of types of denticle after the ratio changed, indicating a loss of many entire species as well as a reduction in shark numbers.</p>
<p>What happened is obscure. For sharks as a group, this was a mass extinction twice as bad as the one at the end of the Cretaceous period, when Earth was hit by an asteroid and the dinosaurs and many other types of animals vanished. In this case, though, as far as it is possible to tell from the rocks, only sharks were affected. And that really is a mystery.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>THE BATTLE of the space cadets is hotting up. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, a pair of billionaires who made their fortunes bending terrestrial technologies to their will, have long been trying to do something similar in outer space, and have founded companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin respectively, to this end. Their motives, however, are not purely commercial. There is a new-frontier zeal involved, too. Both have plans for their firms to build crewed Moon landers. Mr Musk, indeed, has been contracted by NASA to do so. He also hopes to spearhead the human colonisation of Mars.</p>
<p>Mr Musk won an important round of the unspoken competition last year, by being the first to launch people into outer space, courtesy of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, lifted atop a Falcon 9 rocket. But he has not yet gone there himself. Mr Bezos looks likely to trump him here, albeit that the definition of “outer space” involved is quite a technical one—being above the so-called von Kármán line, beyond which the air is so thin that the speed required to provide aerodynamic lift exceeds that required to achieve orbit. Conventionally, this is defined as 100km, though 80km might be a more accurate value.</p>
<p>To this end, Mr Bezos announced on June 7th that he and his brother Mark will be two of the three first passengers taken above the von Kármán line in a capsule carried by New Shepard, a launcher made by Blue Origin and named after Alan Shepard, the first American to make such a rocket-propelled trip. A third seat in the capsule will be auctioned on June 12th and the flight will happen on July 20th.</p>
<p>New Shepard is not, however, powerful enough to reach orbit—which is, to be honest, most people’s idea of what it means to fly into space. Blue Origin’s orbital launcher, New Glenn, named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, is still in development, whereas Mr Musk has such a launcher at his beck and call.</p>
<p>New Glenn’s first, uncrewed, flight is pencilled in for late next year. That gives Mr Musk plenty of time to overtrump his rival by taking a trip into orbit. Both billionaires, though, may be beaten by another. As The Economist went to press, rumours were circulating that Sir Richard Branson, boss of Virgin Galactic, may try to take a trip above the von Kármán line on July 4th, in his firm’s air-launched rocket plane. Watch, as it were, this space.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>“Build a better accelerometer and the world will make a beaten path to your door.” Not, perhaps, as snappy as Ralph Waldo Emerson’s original aphorism about a mousetrap. But it is the hope of Graeme Malcolm, a physicist at the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow. Dr Malcolm’s speciality is high-purity lasers. These can be used to make instruments of great precision. And those, in turn, can be employed to build devices which can detect the tiniest of forces—as tiny, for example, as the gravitational pull of a passing lorry.</p>
<p>Laser light is famously pure. The way lasers work means that the beams which emerge from them are monochromatic. But there is purity, and then there is purity. In a truly monochromatic beam, all light would be of exactly the same frequency. In practice, this never happens. Wobbles caused by small temperature changes and vibrations, and by imperfections in the mirrored cavity in which the beam is generated and amplified, mean no laser beam is perfectly pure. The light from a cheap laser pointer might have a frequency range—known as its line width—of 500 megahertz (mHz), while the line width of a specialised scientific laser would be nearer 1mHz. Dr Malcolm’s latest offering, by contrast, has a line width of a mere 20Hz.</p>
<p>This device, dubbed SolsTiS, has a cavity containing titanium-doped sapphire. This is a common material for lasers, but SolsTiS’s cavity is shaped, by precise engineering and the locking of the components into place after calibration, in a way that both encourages single-frequency emission and ensures that waste heat is dissipated rapidly.</p>
<p>The purity of the resulting beam permits it to do something that seems extraordinary to those (ie, most human beings) who are used to dealing with the world of classical, rather than quantum, mechanics. This is, in effect, to divide atoms temporarily in two using a trick which takes advantage of the fact that all particles, however apparently substantial, are actually also waves.</p>
<p>To pull off this trick the output from the SolsTiS is divided into multiple beams. The atoms in question are a diffuse gas of rubidium in a cell refrigerated to within ten millionths of a degree of absolute zero. This extreme coldness is achieved by using six of these beams to slow the atoms down, in a process called Doppler cooling.</p>
<p>Location, location, location<br>In conditions of such quietude atoms hit by a pulse of light of the correct frequency (to which the SolsTiS laser is tuned), will split into two quantum waves which move apart (see diagram). A second pulse reverses this, bringing the two waves back together, and a third allows them to interfere with each other, creating a characteristic interference pattern that depends on any acceleration the waves underwent when they were separated. A further laser pulse can detect the different interference patterns in the different atoms in the cell, and that information will reveal the amount of acceleration the atoms underwent. To exploit this phenomenon, Dr Malcolm has started a company called M Squared. The plan is to use this atomic interference to create an accelerometer with at least 100 times the precision of existing versions.</p>
<p>Miniature accelerometers are already common (most mobile phones, for example, contain one), but these are mechanical rather than laser-based devices. Their job is inertial navigation, which divides acceleration by time to work out speed and direction travelled, and hence location. Drive into a tunnel, and inertial navigation tracks your position after you lose the gps satellite signal.</p>
<p>Such devices drift rapidly, however. The slightest error is quickly amplified into a big miscalculation of position. Your phone will not stay on track for more than a few minutes, and even the best military-grade inertial-navigation systems, which employ lasers, but not atomic interference, drift by kilometres a day. Atomic-interference accelerometers would, by contrast, drift only 2km a month.</p>
<p>To start with, this reliability will be expensive and require fairly large pieces of kit. It will therefore be of interest mainly for military use, and for one or two other specialist applications, such as mining, where satellite-based navigation is impossible. But the equipment needed should ultimately shrink to chip-size, with a corresponding fall in cost. That would permit its inclusion in vehicles, phones and other mobile electronics, which could be useful in a world of driverless cars, deliveries by drone and autonomous air taxis.</p>
<p>Atomic-interference accelerometers would have other uses, too. Point one vertically and it would become a gravimeter—a device to measure gravity, the strength of which varies subtly from place to place depending on the local geology. Prospectors for oil and minerals have employed gravimeters since the 1930s. Atomic-interference gravimeters promise to be a thousand times more sensitive than current devices. Dr Malcolm says the firm is testing a prototype that, when placed on a barge going over an aqueduct, can detect lorries passing beneath by their gravitational attraction. Such sensitive instruments will provide a finer-grained understanding of an area’s geology before expensive drilling begins.</p>
<p>The first lasers were laboratory curiosities with little practical use, but that has changed enormously over the years. Now, lasers are the basis of multiple better mousetraps, from broadband fibre networks to barcode scanners. Using them to manipulate the quantum properties of atoms in this way promises more such mousetraps in the future. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>“For last year’s words belong to last year’s language”, T.S. Eliot wrote in “Four Quartets”. “And next year’s words await another voice.” Ralph Fiennes speaks these lines on a stage furnished with only a table and two chairs; lighting effects, from sunsets to the fiery red of a bombing raid, gleam behind him. At the Theatre Royal in Bath, a 200-year-old playhouse that Jane Austen knew, Mr Fiennes was marking theatre’s emergence from pandemic hibernation with a 75-minute solo performance of Eliot’s long poem, a four-part meditation on time, change, fate and faith.</p>
<p>It is an apt starting-point for theatre’s post-covid journey. “Four Quartets” wrestles not only with Eliot’s personal crises of faith and identity but the public emergency of the second world war; he composed three of the four pieces between 1939 and 1942. Mr Fiennes has known the poem since childhood but revisited it in lockdown, finding that it chimed with the disrupted times, in which “all the normal infrastructure and expectancies are taken away”. Colleagues who helped put the show on the road “volunteered how contemporary it felt—the sense of reckoning with oneself and with life and soul”.</p>
<p>A restless, barefoot presence on stage, Mr Fiennes chats, argues, muses or banters, voicing Eliot’s gorgeous images and intricate ideas not as a sermon but a dialogue with audiences who have shared a passage through loss and perplexity. The first quartet, “Burnt Norton”, invites them to “Descend lower…Into the world of perpetual solitude…Internal darkness, deprivation”, an experience that the pandemic made commonplace. Tinged with Buddhist and Hindu as well as Christian mysticism, “Four Quartets” suggests that there is no going back, no recovery of the status quo. As Eliot put it in “The Dry Salvages”, the third quartet, “time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.”</p>
<p>Mr Fiennes’s one-man show, which opened last month, recalls the monologues and pared-down productions that were broadcast online or on television to keep drama’s flame flickering when theatres emptied, and social distancing prevailed on stage as well as in the stalls. But its progress across the country—it is touring to several other English cities over the summer—marks a turning-point from private communion to public spectacle. Operating with limited audiences since mid-May, British theatres hope to return to full capacity soon. As they and venues in America inch out of shutdowns, many professionals share Eliot’s insistence in “Little Gidding”, the final quartet, that: “We cannot revive old factions/We cannot restore old policies/Or follow an antique drum.”</p>
<p>In my beginning is my end<br>The pandemic has been devastating for theatres. In Britain, research for uk Theatre and the Society of London Theatre, twin industry bodies, indicates that the sector had suffered around £200m ($282m) in covid-related losses by March 2021. A quarter of freelance theatre workers ceased trading. As Julian Bird, the chief executive of both bodies, observes, covid-19 shone a spotlight on the fragility of drama’s human infrastructure. Buildings on their own are worthless, he says. “We’ve realised absolutely starkly that theatre is nothing without its workforce.” Recovering the designers and technicians forced into other jobs will be essential.</p>
<p>Playhouses in New York have been permitted to open without limits on capacity since May 19th. So far only small off-Broadway venues have sprung back to life. Broadway stages will mostly remain dark at least until mid-September, though “Hadestown”—a musical update of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and so another voyage through purgatory—is scheduled to resurface sooner. And the Public Theatre will return to its open-air home in Central Park, the Delacorte Theatre, on July 6th with a version of Shakespeare’s “The Merry Wives of Windsor” set among the West African community in Harlem.</p>
<p>That production reflects a new social consciousness in theatres on both sides of the Atlantic. In a recent symposium on drama’s future, the Public Theatre’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis, exhorted his peers: “Don’t just come back, but come back more democratic, come back more inclusive.” Nataki Garrett, artistic director of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, concurred: “Normal ended in March 2020. We’re not going back to anything.” Sharpened by the protests during theatre’s enforced lay-off, issues of race will feature more prominently, on stage and off it. Among other recommendations, We See You, White American Theatre, a pressure group, wants at least half of plays performed on main stages to be by non-white writers.</p>
<p>Alongside the politics, though, plenty of theatregoers will long for all-singing, all-dancing escapism. As Eliot wrote in one of the best-known passages in “Four Quartets”, “human kind/Cannot bear very much reality.” As well as “Hadestown”, the old-style, big-cast shows set to make a comeback include Cole Porter’s musical “Anything Goes”, scheduled to open at the Barbican Centre in London.</p>
<p>Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein responded to a similar yearning for spectacle and flamboyance after the second world war. Today’s circumstances are different, not least in the impact of social distancing on box offices. That may put big-budget extravaganzas beyond the reach of many venues struggling out of lockdown. So some pandemic-induced innovations are set to endure and evolve.</p>
<p>Small-cast and solo works, such as Mr Fiennes’s own performance of David Hare’s monologue about his brush with covid, “Beat the Devil”, are one of them. New outdoor venues—a response to ventilation needs—are another. The Arcola Theatre in London, for instance, has built an open but canopied auditorium that recalls the semi-covered playhouses of Shakespeare’s time. Then there are immersive high-tech projects such as the adaptation of José Samarago’s novel “Blindness” put on by both the Donmar Warehouse in London and the Daryl Roth Theatre in New York. Instead of watching actors, audiences wear headphones and encounter the story through lighting and audio recordings.</p>
<p>“Last season’s fruit is eaten”, Eliot wrote in “Four Quartets”. “And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.” As Mr Fiennes notes, the poem is a call to break free of both past and future, to escape the cycle of “sequential time” and “live in the present moment”. At its best, that is one of theatre’s gifts—as, with luck, audiences will rediscover when curtains rise again. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>When two teenagers committed suicide in a quiet corner of north-west Poland in 2015, in part because of opposition to their gay relationship, Daniel Rycharski travelled to the village, took branches from the tree where the pair had killed themselves and made a simple crucifix. He carried his work, “The Cross”, to Warsaw and set it up in front of the presidential palace. Another cross once stood in the same spot to commemorate the traumatic plane crash in Smolensk in 2010 that killed Poland’s president and many other senior officials.</p>
<p>A legion of Polish artists are trying to shine a light on the country’s swing towards intolerance under the ruling Law and Justice party. But Mr Rycharski’s corner of the art scene is a lonely one. He has set up his studio in the village of Kurowko, some 110km from Warsaw. He considers himself a devout Catholic, but as a gay man he is rejected by the Polish church. “For me, to live in Poland is to live in a cage,” Mr Rycharski says.</p>
<p>Through his work, the 35-year-old artist-activist is rattling the bars. Mr Rycharski has moulded rosary beads from resin mixed with the blood of a gay friend. He has crafted scarecrows from wooden crosses and clothes donated by persecuted lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. He stitched an ecclesiastical robe from the garments of Polish clergy, called it “Ku-Klux-Klan” and topped it with a distinctive pointed hood.</p>
<p>Yet Mr Rycharski is devout. Mateusz Pacewicz, an award-winning Polish screenwriter, points out that though “The Cross” could be considered “creepy”, Mr Rycharski’s pilgrimage with the crucifix turned the work into “a religious act, a ritual”. His faith has helped calm his critics. Government officials wrote to the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw complaining about an exhibition of his work in 2019, but stopped short of shutting it down. Ordinary folk have tried to destroy pieces of his that were displayed in public spaces—but some apologised after the artist explained his meaning. “He doesn’t want to lose his connection to the church, he wants to try to create a dialogue,” says Kasia Matt-Uszynska, the curator of Mr Rycharski’s latest show, at the Kahan Art Space in Vienna.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr Rycharski began to consider his own sexuality in his work only recently. Four years ago he left cosmopolitan Krakow, having decided the city wasn’t for him. His goal was to tell the story of Poland’s rural communities, often disparaged as backward and philistine. Mr Rycharski won over local villagers with street art, decorating homes, barns and public spaces with images of hybrid animals, part wild and part domesticated. In 2014 he celebrated the 150th anniversary of the abolition of Poland’s feudal system by erecting a rainbow-coloured triumphal arch outside a neighbour’s home.</p>
<p>It may wind up in galleries across Europe, but his art is almost always displayed on Polish farmland first. His favourite project merged his two worlds. After a string of Polish villages declared themselves lgbtq-free zones, last year Mr Rycharski persuaded five families in rural areas to invite lgbtq visitors to stay for a few days. The most striking exhibit in Vienna is a tapestry depicting one of these hosts, dressed in shorts and a t-shirt, with mechanical farm equipment splayed behind him like the wings of an angel.</p>
<p>Finding willing hosts was hard, Mr Rycharski says. Persuading gay Poles to take part was even tougher. “People trust me, people understand me and people can do things with me they would never do”, he says, “with someone from the outside.” </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>The Second. By Carol Anderson. Bloomsbury; 272 pages; $28 and £18.99</p>
<p>Ablack man with a gun has been white America’s nightmare since before the republic was founded. Slave uprisings, black soldiers fighting in the country’s wars, even African-American motorists—all have spurred fear and violence backed by white-supremacist authority. In “The Second”, a compact yet sweeping history of guns and race in America, Carol Anderson argues that the right “to keep and bear arms” has never been about an abstract liberty to carry guns. Its primary role has been “black exclusion and debasement”.</p>
<p>The Second Amendment, Ms Anderson writes, was born in sin. The word “slavery” never appears in the constitution. Racism is not explicitly inscribed in the Second Amendment. But, she claims, it was at the heart of the guarantee. When the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention (of whom 25 were slave-owners) drafted a replacement for the Articles of Confederation in 1787, they knew they needed the assent of southern states. The amendment, Ms Anderson says, was a “bribe to the South using the control of black people as the payoff”. Slave-owners, terrified that their suffering property would rise up, could be sure of arming themselves.</p>
<p>Other scholars offer more nuanced accounts of the amendment’s origins, but there is little question that its “well-regulated militia” carried a glint of racial dominance. It was buttressed by the Uniform Militia Act of 1792, which required white males aged 18 to 45 to join state militias and buy guns. By contrast, a free black Virginian caught carrying a firearm in 1832 earned 39 lashes. The same punishment applied in Florida and could be enforced by white citizen patrols on the spot. In 1846 Georgia’s Supreme Court found that the Second Amendment protected the “right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys…to keep and bear arms of every description”. But it declined to strike down a law barring “any free persons of colour” from owning them. Several other states had similar prohibitions.</p>
<p>This double-barrelled interpretation contributed to centuries of brutality against defenceless black Americans. Ms Anderson recounts a South Carolina militia’s grisly response to a slave uprising in 1739 in which the enslaved were “tortured, shot, hanged and gibbeted alive”. White militias “made Swiss cheese of [black] men’s backs, especially those who had surrendered” during a massacre in Colfax, Louisiana, in 1873. President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the dishonourable discharge of 167 black soldiers in 1906, on the baseless suspicion that some in their ranks had shot whites in Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<p>The emptiness, for black Americans, of the right to bear arms is amply documented in Ms Anderson’s vivid retelling. No landmarks of racial progress—neither Reconstruction in the 19th century, nor the civil-rights movement of the 20th—made a difference. Nor has the National Rifle Association (nra), the zealous defender of gun rights that came to the fore in the 1960s, targeted this prejudice. In 1967 the nra helped draft a bill in California to disarm the Black Panthers, a black self-defence organisation that “had broken no firearms laws”. Ms Anderson notes that the association has been slow to respond to police violence against black men in recent years, including in 2016 when an officer shot and killed Philando Castile in St Paul, Minnesota, after Castile disclosed that he was (legally) carrying a gun.</p>
<p>Yet as a contribution to the contemporary debate over gun rights, “The Second” comes up short. The book makes no mention of Justice Clarence Thomas’s long concurrence in McDonald v Chicago (2010), which covers much of the same historical ground. Like Ms Anderson, Justice Thomas, himself African-American, lamented as tragic the white supremacy that has persistently denied gun rights to black citizens. But the right to bear arms, in his eyes, remains key to their salvation. Ms Anderson could have grappled with that reading to hone her contrary view: that the amendment is “so inherently, structurally flawed” that it can “never be a pathway to civil and human rights” for black Americans.</p>

<p>The Startup Wife. By Tahmima Anam. Scribner; 304 pages; $26. Canongate; £16.99</p>
<p>Asha and Cyrus get married after they sleep together for the first time. Asha is a talented coding expert with a background in brain modelling. Cyrus, though, is “consistently, encyclopaedically brilliant”. When Asha starts a technology firm that designs personalised rituals—to help secular netizens imbue their lives with meaning—she models the tech on her husband’s brain, its rapacious ability to acquire knowledge and build connections. Then she persuades him to join the company. He names it wai: We Are Infinite.</p>
<p>So runs the swift opening of “The Startup Wife”, Tahmima Anam’s riff on the political and personal dynamics of the tech scene. Soon, Cyrus, Asha and wai are ensconced in the gleaming halls of a tech incubator, a haven of cuddle puddles, corporate yoga and innovators designing apps to fix the universe—even if the futures they envisage are aridly technocratic. The first fly in the kombucha lands when an investor insists that Cyrus be chosen as the outfit’s figurehead. Asha may be the founder, but she remains a woman of Bangladeshi descent in a white tech bro’s world.</p>
<p>The success that follows leaves Cyrus increasingly convinced of his own messianic gifts. Asha, meanwhile, feels herself being edged to the fringes of the company, even to the margins of her own life. Why, she begins to wonder, do her sex and the colour of her skin still set her apart? Why does the engine room of the Utopian future look so much like the narrow elite of the past—stale, pale and male?</p>
<p>In real life Ms Anam’s husband founded a startup, and many of the details of her novel’s self-ironising world, in which hyper-modern ideas and throwback attitudes collide, feel drawn from personal observation. The snappy dialogue is the greatest strength of her brisk narrative—especially when it spears the paradoxes of the immigrant experience. ‘“You’re too young to get married. Full stop,” Asha’s ambitious mother warns her. Asha shoots back: “Why don’t you act like all the other aunties?”</p>
<p>In the end, though, the pacey story seems to linger on the surface of things. The denouement does not quite reach the emotional depths that readers might expect, leaving them wondering how much substance there really was beneath the book’s iMac sheen. </p>

<h1 id="The-trouble-with-the-past"><a href="#The-trouble-with-the-past" class="headerlink" title="The trouble with the past"></a>The trouble with the past</h1><p>A biography of Cleopatra exemplifies a fast-and-loose trend in the writing of history</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>It is like reading Suetonius crossed with Danielle Steel. In a new biography of Cleopatra, the queen remembers the feeling of “Caesar’s chest pressing against her body”. As she steps into a bath, “first, her calves disappear, then her harmonious thighs”.</p>
<p>A remarkable woman who smuggled herself into an audience with Caesar in a sack, Cleopatra may well have recalled his embraces fondly. Her thighs may even have been harmonious. No one can know for sure—yet Alberto Angela is unrepentant about the “fictionalised parts” of his book, a smash-hit in Italy and now released in English. This, he argues, is the “only possible approach” if writers are to supply the vivid details readers want. “If reality has gone,” he argues, “we can make plausible reconstructions based on what we know.”</p>
<p>Mr Angela’s Egyptian ruler embodies, if in exaggerated form, a wider trend in the writing of history. Modern readers are keen to discover the intimate aspects of bygone lives, especially those of women and minorities (last year books about feminism and race topped non-fiction charts in both Britain and America). Often, though, the patchy documentary record is, in today’s lurid parlance, not putting out. So, increasingly, authors are putting in what is missing, using their imaginations to add flesh to the skeletons of the dead. Sometimes, as in the case of Cleopatra, quite literally.</p>
<p>History “is not the past”, Hilary Mantel once said. “It’s what’s left in the sieve when the centuries have run through it.” In the case of the classical world, what is left is sparse. Even very basic things are unknown. “Almost anything with a number on, we don’t know,” says Mary Beard of the University of Cambridge. “We don’t know the date of the eruption of Pompeii…We don’t know the population of the Roman Empire.” Evidence regarding women and minorities is especially thin. There are almost no first-person testimonies from Greek or Roman women. Tantalisingly, Nero’s mother is known to have written a memoir, but it was lost (like almost all classical literature). The poetry of Sappho survives only in scraps.</p>
<p>A foreign country, just like this one<br>Such silences speak volumes. They do not, alas, fill them. That makes the job of scrupulous modern historians painstakingly hard. It took around 12,000 tiny tiles to make a square metre of fine Roman mosaic; to produce a scholarly yet arresting paragraph on classical history, the writer must, like a mosaicist, combine a little colour from a geographer, a sample from a poet and a snippet from an ancient chronicler. Even then, the picture may lack the details and insights modern readers crave.</p>
<p>In part, novels are filling the gap. Authors such as Pat Barker and Madeline Miller have reimagined the classical world and myths from a female perspective. Increasingly, though, books like Mr Angela’s that purport to be non-fiction are blurring the boundaries between history and imagination—leaving readers at a loss to distinguish between documented fact, supposition and fantasy. In “The Kingdom”, Emmanuel Carrère used a bricolage of autobiography, fiction and history to add texture to the story of the earliest Christians; it was a bestseller in France. More commonly, narrative histories that suffuse the past with sights and smells, by authors such as Tom Holland and Helen Castor, have won big readerships.</p>
<p>Academic historians tend to be sniffy about all this. But though their own work may be unsullied by ingratiating ornament, it is also, often, untouched by readers. In one exemplary if extreme comparison, Diarmaid MacCulloch’s exhaustive biography of Thomas Cromwell sold a respectable 32,000 copies in Britain. Ms Mantel’s “Wolf Hall” trilogy, which also recounts Cromwell’s life, has sold 1.9m and counting. As Dan Jones, a popular writer of medieval history, says diplomatically,academic histories tend “not to have crisp readability at the top of their list of priorities”. More bluntly, he reckons that “most academic history is unreadable”.</p>
<p>“People like stories,” Mr Jones explains. What he calls “painful academic textbooks” may be “very useful” to specialists; but they are mostly not intended for a general readership. Academics themselves are beginning to see the problem. Two years ago, Hal Brands and Francis Gavin of Johns Hopkins University wrote an article titled “The Historical Profession is Committing Slow-Motion Suicide”. They lamented the lack of interest in “clear, intelligible prose”, decrying the moment when “academic historians began writing largely for themselves” while “populariser” became “a term of derision”.</p>
<p>The collision of these trends—rising interest in questions not answered in bona fide sources, and the abstruseness of academic texts—represents an opportunity for writers like Mr Angela. He seizes it with aplomb. In “Cleopatra” he evokes the city of Rome so well that you can see its red roofs, and Alexandria so carefully that you can smell the spices in its market (even if the word “ensnare” makes far too many appearances in his rendering of the queen).</p>
<p>To those who think a proper understanding of the past is an important intellectual, even civic, asset, all this is a worry. On the other hand, in the great sweep of history—and of historians—none of it is terribly new. “Everybody has fictionalised history from the very beginning,” says Ms Beard. “That is what Tacitus did. That is what Herodotus did.” Until fairly recently, invention was part of the job description; early historians such as Thucydides openly acknowledged that many speeches in their works were partly made up.</p>
<p>Admittedly, some of the women produced to requite the feminist tastes of modern readers will “be partly fictional”, says Ms Beard. “But then Roman men are partly fictional.” History, she summarises, “is about filling the gaps.” </p>

<h1 id="FObituary-—Ganga-Stone-died-on-June-2nd"><a href="#FObituary-—Ganga-Stone-died-on-June-2nd" class="headerlink" title="(FObituary)—Ganga Stone died on June 2nd"></a>(FObituary)—Ganga Stone died on June 2nd</h1><p>The feeder of New York’s sick and housebound, founder of God’s Love We Deliver, was 79</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-12 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Sometime in 1985, when she was working as a volunteer at a hospice on the Lower East Side, Ganga Stone took a bag of groceries to an actor who was dying of aids. She parked her bicycle and walked up to his apartment, not without trepidation. aids was then ravaging the gay community in New York, and almost nothing was known about it. Its victims were stigmatised and isolated. When the man, Richard Sale, opened the door to her, he was stick-thin and covered with lesions. She had never seen anyone look that bad. And when she handed over the groceries, he deliberately dropped them on the floor. He was far too weak to cope with cooking them. One packet of bread-mix so frustrated him that he tossed it across the room.</p>
<p>What he needed, she realised, was a hot meal delivered directly to him. That day she bought one at the corner deli and took it up. This was better, but still not perfect. Richard needed food that was tailored to his illness and could tempt the jaded appetite of someone dying, so she did research and, the next time, cooked something for him herself. This worked, and also seized her with a sudden idea. She would give up her current job, selling coffee from a cart on Wall Street, and set up a system to feed aids sufferers in their homes: every day, free, all over the city. And she would call it “God’s Love We Deliver”. At last, here was purpose in her life.</p>
<p>It started in the tiny kitchen of her apartment with her room-mate Jane Best, both of them taking phone orders and buying ingredients with their own money, but soon outgrew anything their stove could manage. She turned to take-out, recruited friends, urged restaurants to give spare food and put collecting tins beside cash registers in stores, talking up the cause with her blue eyes blazing. Besides that she was still chief courier, racing round Manhattan on her bike, because it was sheer joy to place that bag of good fresh food in someone’s hands, and see them smile.</p>
<p>She could not do that job for long, however. God’s Love swelled like a proving loaf. By 1993 it was providing two meals a day to 550 clients in all five boroughs, with 1,700 volunteers helping. That year it moved from a church basement to a 16,000-square-foot building in SoHo, and still that was too small. The service expanded to include almost anyone who was homebound and struggling to find food. Celebrities, including New York’s mayors, gave donor-parties and brand-new delivery vans. Money poured in, two-thirds of it in private donations. By this year, when God’s Love had proved its worth all over again during the covid lockdowns, 17,000 volunteers were feeding 2.5m New Yorkers on a budget of $23m.</p>
<p>Why “God’s Love”? people asked her. It sounded too pious, but she thought it was funny, like a lit-up restaurant sign. God was not someone or something she hid, and it could be any God: Jesus, Shiva, Allah, Supreme Truth, consciousness. Perfectly non-sectarian. Food was part of that love, unconditional as a mother’s, given constantly and with pleasure by people who expected nothing back. No questions were asked when an order came in, but the meals, as irresistibly delicious as she insisted they had to be, were sent out at once. Never a day missed. Since she herself hated to stand in line in a restaurant, why should her clients wait? This was love that went beyond the personal.</p>
<p>At the personal kind she was not so good. Her marriage, to an Australian busboy with flowing blond hair she had met while waitressing at Max’s Kansas City, was a disaster from day one. After 13 months she walked out, with a son now, but somehow she could not connect with the little boy, who went to live unhappily with his father. In 1987 a one-night fling with a Wall Street customer resulted in a daughter, Hedley, whom she kept close, though the father bolted. Single life was no joke, but New York, she concluded, was a hard place to find a man. Sometimes she seemed picked on from the start, with a violent father and the sense that neither of her parents thought she was good for much.</p>
<p>Only one person thought she was: Swami Muktananda, “Baba”, as she called him, whose ashram in India was her home in the late 1970s. Baba, to her, was part of that greater and universal love she longed to enter into. It was he who called her Ganga after the Ganges, the ever-surging energy of Shiva. After his death she wore a red bindi for a year and bought a wedding ring, as though she had been his wife. But this spiritual marriage was tough, too. At the ashram she scrubbed stone floors and did not speak for almost a year. And when she bowed before Baba, he sometimes hit her. She took it as a gift, a training in self-control.</p>
<p>His more lasting training was in how she should see death. She had gone to the ashram still mourning her mother, who had died 12 years earlier of motor neurone disease. Baba taught her that death was merely the dropping of the body by the soul, which then moved on. It was the most important moment in a human life, and nothing to grieve about.</p>
<p>For her this teaching was as vital as hot meals. Food had to come first; then, as equal comfort, news of the immortal self. She began to lead “death classes” for patients and their partners, and in 1995 stepped down from God’s Love to focus on that work. Sadness had no place in it; instead, she told death-jokes. She wrote a book called “Start the Conversation”. (“The One who sails through death and out the other side is who you are. Have you got that?”) And, once again, this put some people off. How did she know? Where did that piercing certainty come from?</p>
<p>She would say, from experience. She had proof of her mother’s continued existence, as well as Baba’s, whose life still sparked in her like electricity. God’s Love, too, had been set up originally for those near death. In its first year, 400 clients died. She had treasured those last weeks, when even young men welled up with the wisdom of the old, and yet the world avoided listening.</p>
<p>One of those clients had been Richard. After their first difficult encounter, they had become brief friends. And in retrospect, even his throwing of the bread-mix was wisdom. It started something she and all New York turned out to be grateful for. </p>
