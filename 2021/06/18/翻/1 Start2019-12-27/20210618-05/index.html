<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>In the 1970s the fortunes of the world economy, in all its unfathomable complexity, seemed to turn on one product: oil. Exported by a narrow clique of countries, this vital input was hostage to ferocious political forces. Today the world’s economic prospects similarly depend on another all-important input, vaccines, which are also narrowly produced, delicately political—and unevenly distributed. Widespread vaccination is helping America to boom, pushing core inflation to its highest rate since 1992. But delays in buying, making and deploying shots have left much of the world vulnerable to new virus outbreaks and economic setbacks.</p>
<p>On June 16th America’s Federal Reserve raised its forecast for growth, inflation and interest rates, noting the country’s vaccine progress. The median Fed official now expects two rate hikes in 2023. The change of tone was enough to increase bond yields both in America and in economies on the other side of the vaccine divide.</p>
<p>The global economy should grow briskly this year: by 5.6%, according to the World Bank, which also updated its forecasts this month. But it is a “tale of two recoveries”, says the bank’s Ayhan Kose. Rich countries, many of which have vaccinated people relatively quickly, are enjoying, in Dickensian terms, a spring of hope and so on. But where vaccination has lagged, especially in poor countries, some economies seem to be going direct the other way.</p>
<p>The divide between the jabs and jab-nots is visible even in a simple comparison of vaccination rates and growth forecasts (see chart). Among the big economies highlighted by the World Bank, the ten with the highest vaccination rates are forecast to grow by 5.5% this year on average. The ten with the lowest are set to grow by just 2.5%. The divide also shows up in forecast revisions. Thanks to America’s pace of inoculation (as well as the scale of its stimulus), its projected growth for 2021 was revised upwards from 3.5% to 6.8% since the World Bank last released its forecasts in January. Emerging economies that have vaccinated faster than their peers have also enjoyed large upgrades.</p>
<p>On the other side of the divide, the picture is far more chequered. In the world’s poorest 29 economies (including 23 countries in sub-Saharan Africa), only 0.3% of the population has received even one dose of vaccine. This group’s growth prospects have deteriorated. Their combined gdp is set to grow by 2.9% this year (not 3.4% as forecast six months ago). That would be their second-worst performance in the past two decades. Their worst was last year.</p>
<p>Vaccination helps growth in at least two ways. It allows countries to relax lockdowns or any other restrictions on social interaction that are still inhibiting the economy. And in places like New Zealand that have already lifted such measures, it reduces the risk of a future outbreak, making growth more resilient. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has calculated an “effective lockdown index” that combines a tally of policy measures with data on mobility drawn from mobile phones. It shows that social hustle and bustle has returned to many countries with high vaccination rates. As the pace of inoculation picks up, others will join them. Indeed, the countries most likely to outperform over the next few months, says Goldman Sachs, are those that are simultaneously making rapid progress in achieving immunity yet still labouring under social restrictions. They have yet to feel the benefit of relaxing restrictions, but will soon do so.</p>
<p>In this kind of country timely economic data are still depressed by social curbs that will ease given the pace of vaccination. In other countries, however, such as Taiwan, new outbreaks of covid-19 have yet to show up fully in mainstream economic indicators, which remain strong. The “nowcast” model of JPMorgan Chase, which uses monthly data to predict where the economy is today shows Taiwan growing at an annual pace of about 9% in the second quarter. But the bank thinks that Taiwan’s economy will in fact have shrunk over that period. In the euro area, by contrast, JPMorgan expects vaccinations to have lifted growth this quarter to over 7% at an annual pace. The bank’s nowcast model, however, is predicting growth of less than 3%.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the global vaccine gap, it is worth asking how quickly it is closing. Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Turkey and Mexico will each get at least one shot into the arms of half their population by August, reckons Goldman. South Africa and India will not reach that benchmark until December. In both of those countries, however, many people have already recovered from the virus, giving them some level of natural immunity. Michael Spencer of Deutsche Bank thinks that India, for example, could reach a 70% immunity level in less than nine months, counting everyone who has had either a past infection or a first shot of a vaccine.</p>
<p>An uneven recovery is better than none. But the strength of some countries’ growth could create problems for other parts of the world. America’s boom, for example, has pushed its own consumer prices up by 5% in May, compared with a year earlier, and could also add to price pressure elsewhere, forcing central banks to respond.</p>
<p>Brazil, for example, has raised interest rates sharply this year. On June 11th Russia’s central bank also tightened for the third time since March. Its governor, Elvira Nabiullina, cited both vaccination rates and “extremely loose monetary and fiscal policies in major economies” as reasons behind the increase in Russian prices. She worries that higher inflation in Russia and elsewhere may prove more persistent than “perceived at first glance”.</p>
<p>Even temporary inflation could unsettle financial markets, making investors doubt the Fed’s commitment to easy money. That could increase the risk premium emerging markets pay on their borrowing. “We are not necessarily worried about inflation,” says Mr Kose, whose team forecasts a rise in global inflation from 2.5% last year to 3.9% in 2021. “But we are worried about how these inflationary pressures can complicate policymaking” in emerging markets, especially those with large amounts of foreign-currency debt.</p>
<p>Policymakers in these countries fear a repeat of the “taper tantrum” in 2013, when the Fed’s talk about reducing (or “tapering”) its asset purchases led to an abrupt rise in American bond yields and a painful sell-off in emerging-market assets. At its meeting on June 15th-16th, the Fed began discussing an eventual tapering, but the timing of such a move remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Global inflation this year will remain a far cry from the double-digit rates experienced in the stagflationary 1970s. But just as the oil crisis back then forced policymakers into awkward dilemmas, obliging them to raise interest rates in the face of economic weakness, this year’s vaccine shortage could create similar discomfort for them. The price of uneven vaccination may be premature austerity and monetary tightening in some unprotected parts of the world. Countries that jab too late may have to hike too soon. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Afavoured pastime for city dwellers on holiday to quainter towns and villages is to peruse the windows of local property firms and dream of swapping their cramped two-bedroom flat for an entire house and garden. Your correspondent is not immune to the appeal: she gazed wistfully at a pretty house near the Deschutes river in Bend, Oregon, situated among the lakes and peaks of the Cascade mountains (pictured). She dutifully checked the listing price on Zillow, a real-estate platform, only to face grim reality: the three-bedroom house was worth $1.25m, a 44% increase from a year earlier, yielding a price per square foot higher than Queens and most of Washington, dc.</p>
<p>It is hard not to feel unease at the spectacle America’s housing market is making of itself. House prices have risen 13% on the year, the biggest jump since before the 2007-09 financial crisis. Inventories of homes for sale have plummeted: there are so few on offer in America that there are currently more agents than there are listings. The typical home sells in 17 days, a record low, for 1.7% more than its asking price, a record high. When Redfin, another property platform, conducted its annual survey of around 2,000 homebuyers, 63% reported having bid for a home they had not seen in person. The last boom in house prices was followed by a deep and painful recession. Is history likely to repeat itself?</p>
<p>Consider the mixed news first. The average loan to value of a new mortgage in America is a reasonable-sounding 83%. On the reassuring side, this figure has not crept higher even as prices have soared. The worrying aspect is that borrowers are bifurcated. If a homebuyer can put up 20% of the value of a property, they do not have to buy private mortgage insurance. As such around 40% of borrowers make a 20% or greater down-payment. Most of the rest—more than half—put down less than 10%. Given how rapidly prices in some markets have soared, a house-price slump could leave some of them underwater.</p>
<p>And yet compared with the past, borrowers are in much better financial shape. Just a quarter of mortgages originated between 2004 and 2007 were for people with “very good” credit scores (above 760). An eighth of borrowers were “subprime”, with scores below 620. Standards are higher now. In 2019 60% of mortgages were made to those with scores above 760. This share climbed further during the covid-19 pandemic as banks, fearing losses, tightened lending standards: 73% of mortgages made in the first quarter of 2021 went to borrowers with very good credit scores. Just 1.4% went to subprime borrowers.</p>
<p>There is anecdotal evidence of caution from mortgage bankers, too. They are reputedly calling up workplaces to ensure that employees relocating out of the big, high-cost-of-living cities will be allowed to work remotely indefinitely. One bank reports that its busiest lending businesses have been those catering to the well-heeled: mortgages for second homes and “jumbo” mortgages (those bigger than $550,000). If the roaring housing market of the mid-2000s was the product of reckless lending to unreliable borrowers, the boom now is made of different stuff: large loans made to wealthy borrowers with long credit histories in search of greener pastures. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>In a world in which transparency has become a fetish, it is refreshing to try to get a read on the People’s Bank of China (pboc). Its various nods and winks give market analysts something to interpret—or over-interpret. On May 31st it announced that it would increase the proportion of foreign-currency deposits that commercial banks must keep on reserve at the central bank, from 5% to 7%. After some chin-scratching, pboc watchers came to a conclusion: China was sending a signal that the yuan had been rising a bit too quickly.</p>
<p>China used to intervene directly—by buying and selling dollars—to get the exchange rate it wanted. As recently as 2016 it ran down its foreign-exchange reserves from $4trn to $3trn to support the yuan. But for the past four years or so its reserves have been stable; there has been no large-scale intervention to either put a floor under the yuan or to check its rise. The surprise is not that China has thrown a little sand in the gears of its currency market. It is that it has become so tolerant of some fairly big swings in the yuan’s value.</p>
<p>The yuan began its recent ascent a year ago (see chart), as China’s factories reopened and demand for goods surged in the locked-down rich world. Chinese exporters took a greater share of world manufacturing, says Mansoor Mohi-uddin, of Bank of Singapore, which in turn increased the trade demand for yuan. Some headwinds became tailwinds. The yuan had traded at a discount to reflect fears of an escalation in the Sino-American trade wars. Exporters worried about a further hit to their revenues were inclined to hoard dollars—in part as security against their dollar debts. The prospect of Donald Trump’s electoral defeat changed the picture. The chances of further tariffs on Chinese goods were much reduced. Moreover, monetary conditions favoured speculative flows out of dollars and into yuan. In contrast to the Federal Reserve, the pboc did not slash interest rates when the pandemic struck. The seven-day reverse-repo rate, one of China’s benchmarks, was trimmed by just 30 basis points to 2.2%, while the Fed funds rate was cut to 0.1%. The higher interest on offer in China’s money markets favoured its currency.</p>
<p>That is not all. China has been opening its markets to overseas investors. Non-residents can more easily buy and sell stocks and bonds on the mainland’s markets. China’s government bonds and “A” shares have qualified for inclusion in global benchmarks, such as the msci equity indices and the Bloomberg Barclays bond index, which are tracked by huge pools of capital. A steady flow of foreign purchases has pushed up the yuan. China has not stood in the way. Tellingly on May 31st the pboc picked a tool that does not interfere much with portfolio inflows.</p>
<p>Still, there is a paradox. China has relaxed its hold on the yuan at a time when the ruling Communist Party has sought to exert greater control on private-sector businesses and on Chinese life in general. If China-watchers know anything, it is that control is prized in Beijing. Being in control does not mean that everything has to be nailed down, though. In the eternal trilemma between monetary autonomy, openness to capital and currency stability, something has to give. China has chosen to forgo a stable currency. That allows it greater traction over the domestic money supply and credit growth, which its regulators are more fretful about.</p>
<p>China’s global ambitions for the yuan also influence its policy choices. It has the world’s second-largest bond market and third-largest stockmarket. Yet foreigners still own fairly few of its assets. Even central banks, which have had access to China’s bond markets for a while, keep only 2% of their reserves in yuan. That is barely more than they hold in the Canadian dollar. Four years ago there was a vigorous internal debate about the merits of freer capital flows, says Eswar Prasad of Cornell University. But for the past two years the consensus has shifted in favour of them. If the yuan is to be a global currency, it needs first to be set free.</p>
<p>Even so, no one is confusing the yuan with a free-floating currency. There are ways—including all that subtle central-bank semaphoring—for China to exert influence. It is still far from transparent about where its tolerance bands begin and end. Such ambiguity is wise: give the markets a number and they will test it. Perhaps surprisingly China has not stood in the way of a much stronger yuan. But its policymakers reserve the right to keep currency markets guessing.</p>

<p>Investors in companies issuing high-yield or “junk” debt have had a relatively benign pandemic. Usually such highly leveraged borrowers are stung by economic hardship. During the global financial crisis over a decade ago around a seventh of such firms in America defaulted on their debt in one year. Yet according to Moody’s, a rating agency, less than 9% of them went into default in the year to August 2020, and the rate has continued to drop since. By the end of 2021, a booming recovery should put it back below its long-term average of 4.7%</p>
<p>It may be too soon for high-yield investors to congratulate themselves, though. The low default rate masks a market that is much riskier than it was before covid-19 struck. Take high-yield bonds, the market for which is worth $1.7trn. Issuers have record levels of debt relative to their earnings, increasing their vulnerability to higher interest rates or a disappointing economic recovery. Cash-strapped borrowers are taking advantage of less restrictive loan contracts to rough up their creditors. And for the companies that do default, loans that used to be associated with high levels of protection and security are turning out to offer lenders anything but.</p>
<p>Start with the sheer amount of debt. Last year $435bn-worth of junk bonds were issued. As a result, the average high-yield borrower now has debt equivalent to an unprecedented six-and-a-half times their trailing 12 months’ gross operating profits, or ebitda (see chart). Oleg Melentyev, of Bank of America, cautions that the low default rate may have merely deferred the pain. “Companies are carrying the baggage of capital structures that should have been restructured, but weren’t,” he says. “We will pay the price of elevated defaults at a later point in the cycle.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, borrowers with liquidity problems have the upper hand over their lenders. Evan Friedman and Enam Hoque of Moody’s describe how investors’ hunger for returns during more than a decade of low interest rates has loosened loan agreements. Maintenance covenants, or restrictive clauses that allow lenders to seize the reins if the borrower’s financial position deteriorates, are now mostly absent. Worse, incurrence covenants, which place limits on borrowers’ ability to issue new debt and pay dividends, have lost force over time. “When you go covenant-lite and make your incurrence covenants toothless, you give all the flexibility to the borrower to run the show,” says Mr Friedman.</p>
<p>Running it some of them are. Serta Simmons Bedding, a mattress manufacturer, gained notoriety last year for raising $200m by swapping its debts to some lenders for new ones with a higher level of security. Without their consent, the non-participating creditors were exposed to higher losses in the event of a default. A lawsuit seeking to unwind the transaction was dismissed by the courts, paving the way for similar deals in the future.</p>
<p>What happens to loans that do turn sour? Lenders are used to the idea that so-called “first-lien” debt grants them priority over the borrower’s assets should it go bankrupt. But Moody’s analysis of defaults during the pandemic shows that first-lien lenders are losing nearly twice as much of their capital as they used to: the average recovery rate in 2020 was 55%, compared with a long-term average of 77%.</p>
<p>This is the result of deteriorating debt structures, another decade-long trend. In the past, first-lien loans had high recovery rates because a significant portion of the remaining debt was subordinated—ie, behind them in the queue in the event of a default. But in 2020 over a third of first-lien loans had no junior debt sitting beneath them to absorb losses. If all of a borrower’s debt has a first claim over its assets, the value of that claim is lower, and lenders lose more protection.</p>
<p>None of this necessarily means that America’s high-yield market is heading for catastrophe. Interest rates remain low, and a rapid recovery should restore earnings. But a nasty surprise on either front could quickly spell trouble. The covid-19 default cycle may yet have a sting in the tail. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>TALK TO BANKERS and some will tell you that when it comes to cyber-crime, they are second only to the military in terms of the strength of their defences. And yet trawl the dark web, as Intel 471, an intelligence firm, did on behalf of The Economist in May, and it is obvious that attempts to breach those walls are commonplace. One criminal was detected trying to recruit insiders within America’s three biggest banks, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, offering a “seven-to-eight-figure” weekly payment to authorise fraudulent wire transfers. Another was auctioning the details of 30m accounts at Bank Mellat in Iran (a country of 83m).</p>
<p>Such activity represents the handiwork of a new breed of bank robber. Forget the hold-ups of yore. Today’s smartest hackers are likely to be backed by rogue states, such as North Korea and, to a lesser extent, Iran, or tolerated by countries such as Russia and China. They benefit from unprecedented resources and protection from law-enforcement agencies. As well as attempting to empty accounts, they also target data for insider trading.</p>
<p>As one of the first industries to offer online transactions, banks have been fending off hackers since the dawn of the internet. They spend more on cyber-security than any other sort of firm—$2,691 per employee—and manage to foil a lot of the attempted thefts. Nonetheless, since 2016, no industry has suffered more from attacks than banks (see chart).</p>
<p>Speaking to Congress in May, Jane Fraser, who runs Citigroup, a Wall Street giant, called hacks the biggest threat to America’s financial system. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase has said they could become “an act of war”. The result is that banks are under constant pressure to prepare for the worst. “It’s not a matter of ‘if’, it’s a matter of ‘when’,” says the head of cyber-security at a central bank. The bankers need to know the methods and motives of their enemies. What have they learned and can they remain a step ahead?</p>
<p>As in other industries, attempts to rob banks online generally start with “phishing”, or tricking an employee into downloading a benign-looking software, known as a “Trojan”, that, once installed, creates a backdoor for other viruses to infect the company’s systems. The ruses can be elaborate. In 2019, when hackers infiltrated Redbanc, an interbank network connecting Chile’s ATM system, they faked a lengthy hiring process, complete with rounds of video interviews, just to fool one victim into downloading and running a Trojan.</p>
<p>Once the backdoor is installed, the hackers have numerous modi operandi. These have evolved over time. In the early to mid-2010s a popular tactic was to alter banks’ databases to inflate balances on existing accounts in order to drain them with fraudulent online transfers. Another was to steal the names and passwords of employees authorised to access SWIFT, the interbank messaging system that banks use for international transfers, in order to make fraudulent transfers to the robbers’ own bank accounts. In the world’s biggest cyber-heist, in 2016, thieves transferred funds from an account the Bangladeshi central bank held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to banks in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia. They stole $81m.</p>
<p>Ransomware attacks, such as those common elsewhere in business, are on the rise. But banks are exposed in other ways, too. One example is “jackpotting”, where malware manipulates ATMs into spitting out lots of cash, accessible to fake cards, even if no funds exist. Thieves then hire packs of money mules, typically from local mafias, to stage multiple withdrawals at once. Using such methods, in 2018 criminals got away with $13.5m from India’s Cosmos Bank through 15,000 cash-machine withdrawals in just two hours.</p>
<p>Another tactic is to turn websites that banks visit regularly into poisoned “watering holes”, most infamously in 2017 when criminals successfully targeted 104 mostly financial firms in 31 countries, including seven banks in Britain and 15 in America. In this case the websites of central banks in Poland, Mexico and others were booby-trapped so that banks would download malicious files and infect themselves with malware. These could be used to spy on the banks, steal their data and ultimately make fraudulent transfers (though in most cases the intrusion appears to have been discovered before money was stolen).</p>
<p>Sometimes it is data, not money, that the robbers are after. The latest trick is to steal financial-market data from within banks in order to facilitate insider trading. A survey by VMware, a cyber-security firm, of 126 financial firms worldwide found that 51% saw a rise in such attacks last year. Portfolio managers in America and Britain that were recently breached saw suspicious activity whenever they were about to trade, says Tom Kellermann, the firm’s strategy boss.</p>
<p>The multiplicity of methods is compounded by the malevolence of those involved. Originally heists were mostly conducted by private thieves from former Soviet states. They included Carbanak, a notorious syndicate that stole over $1bn from 100 banks after 2013 (its masterminds were arrested in 2018). But since America cut North Korea out of its financial system in 2017, the hermit state has doubled down on its relationship with criminal gangs as a way of “making profit and evading sanctions”, says Michael D’Ambrosio, a top investigator in America’s secret service. Variously named Lazarus, Bluenoroff or BeagleBoyz, such state-sponsored entities have access to vastly more resources and personnel than mere criminals. Their members often live under cover in Russia and China, says Mark Arena of Intel 471. An indictment by America’s Department of Justice published in January accuses two individuals, linked to a North Korean military intelligence agency, of attempting to steal more than $1.3bn via cyber-enabled bank heists and ATM raids, as well as extorting cryptocurrency companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, rogue states often form joint ventures with private gangs. One of them, a Russian-speaking outfit that operates an infamous Trojan-for-hire called Trickbot, provides access to many infected computers. Some cyber experts were shocked recently when they found that it had been used in conjunction with North Korean malware in recent attacks.</p>
<p>It is not clear how much money drains out of the back door. Numbers crunched by Advisen, a consultancy, suggest banks have lost about $12bn to cybercrime since 2000, around three-quarters of which have come from data breaches. Studies suggest every hour of business interruption costs a bank $300,000 on average; a typical data breach causes losses of $6m.</p>
<p>But banks usually forbid staff from discussing such attacks, and the reported numbers dramatically understate the problem. Though many institutions are obliged to report serious hacks to regulators and, sometimes, customers, rules change frequently and vary across jurisdictions, meaning disclosure is haphazard.</p>
<p>Moreover, initial losses can be dwarfed by second-order effects. The average incident puts 27% of customers at high risk of closing down their accounts at a targeted firm, and sinks companies’ share prices by 5-7% on average, says John Meyer of Cornerstone Advisors, a consultancy. A Supreme Court case in Britain this summer could make class-action lawsuits by customers affected by cyber-breaches easier, exposing banks to hundreds of millions of pounds in potential damages.</p>
<p>Not everything is going the criminals’ way, though. Forensic firms are doing a good job of attributing attacks to specific hacking groups, and intelligence agencies at linking web handles to real people. Some gangs are neutralised or caught. In September the American army launched a cyber offensive that weakened TrickBot, the North Korea-backed Trojan. In January Ukrainian police, in an operation with European and American counterparts, arrested the thieves running Emotet, another botnet allegedly responsible for at least $2.5bn in theft since 2014.</p>
<p>Banks strive to build nimbler fortifications and hire friendly “white-hat” hackers to probe their own defences. The biggest are spending more: in June Bank of America said it would invest $1bn annually to counter mounting threats. A survey by Deloitte found that financial firms spent an average 0.48% of their revenue on cyber-security last year, up from 0.34% in 2019. Applied to the industry’s total revenue in 2020, that would make for $23bn-worth in spending in America alone.</p>
<p>But things may get worse because, firstly, banks’ networks are becoming costlier to secure. “We recognise that we’re never going to prevent everything,” says the cyber chief of a top American bank. “So we have to have layered defences that assume multiple defences will fail.” The multiplication of internet-connected devices, the digitalisation of banking, and remote working are offering new points of entry for attackers. Akamai, a security firm that serves eight out of the world’s top ten banks, witnessed 736m attacks against financial firms’ web-based applications last year, a two-thirds increase from 2019. The expansion of fintech firms without consistent regulation is creating blind spots. And banks’ migration to the cloud, on paper deemed more secure, could backfire if it ends up concentrating risk on just a few platforms, says Jano Bermudes of Marsh, an insurance broker.</p>
<p>Secondly, the criminals have more resources—both technological and financial—at their disposal. According to security experts, they mainly focus on expelling intruders before they have time to loot. Yet, says one, soon hackers are likely to use artificial intelligence to shorten an attack from start to finish—the “kill chain” in the jargon. Cyber-gangs are also growing rich. Maze, one of them, announced its “retirement” in November after pocketing over $100m in ransoms in a year. Moreover, up-and-coming criminals are attempting to surf on the top tier’s success. Last autumn, hackers posing as Lazarus and Fancy Bear (an infamous Russian group) threatened over 100 financial firms with distributed denial-of-service attacks, in which “botmasters” mobilise vast networks of infected machines to flood their targets with internet traffic if they do not pay a ransom.</p>
<p>Such hackers can count on thriving secondary markets to monetise their loot. On ToRReZ, an eBay lookalike that The Economist recently visited via an ultra-private browser, credit-card details go for $25 a pop—or four for the price of three. For $4.99, a tutorial offers help in building phishing websites copying those of Barclays, a British bank. Purchases are paid in cryptocurrencies that can be cashed out in bank accounts opened with fake IDs (a driving licence from Tennessee costs $150, for instance). The new bank robbers are as criminally entrepreneurial as ever.</p>

<p>As economies reopen, labour shortages are still worsening. In America the number of unfilled vacancies, at 9.3m, has never been so high. Job postings in Canada are 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Even in Europe, slower out of the post-lockdown gates, a growing number of employers complain of how hard it is to find staff. Debates over labour shortages have focused on welfare policy and economic disruption. But the phenomenon has a deeper lesson. It tells us something about the myths of automation.</p>
<p>Economists have confidently asserted that a wave of job-killing robots was sweeping the labour market. The imf says the pandemic is “hastening a shift in employment away from sectors more vulnerable to automation”. In a recent co-written article Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prizewinner, says the extra costs of covid-19 are “accelerating the development and adoption of new technologies to automate human work.” In congressional testimony last year Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested that more firms were “substituting machines for workers”. But can pandemic-induced automation really be creating an army of surplus workers if employers are complaining of a deficit?</p>
<p>The economists had good reason to believe that job-killing automation would surge. Recessions often lead firms to adopt more robots, in part because labour gets more expensive as revenues but not wages decline. In a pandemic bosses have an extra incentive to automate jobs, as research by the imf has shown. Robots do not need to socially distance. Nor do they get sick. Thanks largely to government stimulus programmes, firms have also accumulated spare cash, which they may now be able to deploy on robotics or on artificial-intelligence software.</p>
<p>Those who believe that automation is speeding up can point to many examples. In Ohio Lee’s Famous Recipe Chicken, a restaurant chain, has installed automated voice systems to take drive-through orders. Pittsburgh’s international airport recently became America’s first to use ultraviolet robots for cleaning. British farmers boast of using ever more machines to pick strawberries and kill weeds. The number of news stories mentioning both “pandemic” and “automation” is growing at an annual rate of 25%.</p>
<p>The automation debate is heavy on speculation and anecdote. It is light on evidence. The citation from one prominent wonk to justify the claim that automation was “already” happening included a New York Times article and a theoretical microeconomics paper. According to some research, last year automatable jobs vanished in large numbers; but it is hard to disentangle the effect of technological change from lockdowns. It is true that America’s gdp is nearly at its pre-pandemic level even as the level of employment is 7m lower. This, some say, shows that the economy can get by with many fewer people. But it could just mean that productivity per worker has risen, perhaps because of poorly understood things like remote working. Many of those on the sidelines will get jobs as fear of the virus fades and they find something which suits them, in turn raising output above pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>It is not only labour shortages which undermine the story of a growing wave of job-killing robots. In America the wages of the worst-paid workers, who are thought to be especially vulnerable to automation, are rising more quickly than the average, in contrast to the aftermath of the financial crisis. Borrowing a methodology from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, The Economist has divided America’s labour market into “routine” and “non-routine” roles. Routine jobs involve patterns which are easier for robots to learn: say, data entry or checking out goods in a supermarket. For four decades routine jobs have slowly declined as a share of the total, as robots have improved (see chart).</p>
<p>Sticking with the routine<br>So far, however, the covid-induced downturn is bucking the trend. Had the pre-pandemic rate continued, we estimate that in May 2021 routine jobs would have accounted for 40.9% of overall employment. In fact they now account for 41.4%, meaning that America now has in the order of 1m “extra” routine jobs than expected. Perhaps the uncertainty over variants is deferring some investment in robotics. The mere act of installing new machinery is also more difficult in a world of travel bans and quarantine. American imports of industrial robots fell by 3% in 2020.</p>
<p>Australia may be a better place to look for signs of a job-killing wave. After some strict lockdowns the country has been under fairly loose domestic restrictions for over a year, giving a glimpse of what may lie in store elsewhere. Adapting the results of a government study in 2015, we gave 335 occupations (from “hotel and motel managers” to “complementary health therapists”) a score from zero to 100, reflecting how automatable they seem.</p>
<p>Automatable jobs were in relative decline before the pandemic, falling to 57% of the workforce by 2019. The trend has continued, with evidence of a covid-19 acceleration: 55% of Australians are now employed in vulnerable occupations. (We found similar trends in New Zealand.) Yet Australia’s unemployment rate is nearly as low as before the pandemic. Howls from employers about labour shortages are even louder than in America. Automation is not, it seems, putting people on the economic scrapheap.</p>
<p>The pessimists could eventually be proved right. But even if they are not, predictions of a world without work will continue. This is because the enduring fear of the march of the machines is not really the result of a dispassionate analysis of the evidence. It could hardly be so, when centuries of technological improvement have never led to widespread structural unemployment. Countries with more robots tend to have less joblessness, not more.</p>
<p>Worries about technological unemployment are instead the expression of something else. They reflect a deep-seated fascination with and fear of technology. And they reflect many economists’ concern to get policymakers to pay more attention to the job prospects of people with the least marketable skills, who are always most vulnerable to economic shifts and shocks. These are perfectly understandable motivations. But next time you hear a warning about job-killing robots, think twice. </p>

<h1 id="Science-amp-technology-—Business-is-booming-as-regulators-relax-drone-laws"><a href="#Science-amp-technology-—Business-is-booming-as-regulators-relax-drone-laws" class="headerlink" title="(Science &amp; technology)—Business is booming as regulators relax drone laws"></a>(Science &amp; technology)—Business is booming as regulators relax drone laws</h1><p>Uncrewed aerial vehicles get more freedom to fly</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Although drones, or uncrewed aerial vehicles (uavs) as they are also known, were originally developed for military target practice and surveillance, the civilian versions that have emerged over the past decade have created a thriving new industry. Commercial uavs, especially the hovering type, are used for jobs ranging from inspecting power lines, buildings and crops, to aerial photography, transporting medical supplies and even delivering pizzas. The value of this market reached $22.5bn last year, according to Drone Industry Insights, a German research firm with its eye on the business. By 2025 that figure is expected to exceed $42bn.</p>
<p>Something helping to accelerate this growth is a gradual relaxation of the strictures that aviation authorities, being naturally cautious about all these newfangled flying machines taking to the sky, have imposed on the industry. In most countries, drones may not be flown near people or over built-up areas, and must be kept within view of their operator. Exemptions may be sought for specific flights, but this can be a long-winded process, hedged with restrictions. For instance, regulators have usually insisted on ground observers being used to follow flights beyond an operator’s visual line-of-sight, or bvlos as it is known. This means extra staff have to be hired and trained, which pushes up costs.</p>
<p>However, as companies build up their flying experience, things are starting to change. In January, for example, a firm called American Robotics became the first operator approved by America’s Federal Aviation Administration (faa) to fly automated uavs at specific sites without any pilots or observers being present. Staff at the company’s base near Boston oversee these flights, even though the drones operate as far away as Nevada and Kansas.</p>
<p>To infinity and beyond<br>At the moment, American Robotics’ flights take place in rural areas. Their purpose is to survey farmland. The company’s quadcopter Scout drones wait, charged up and ready to fly, in boxes located on customers’ farms. At the beginning of a mission the box lid slides open and the drone, sitting on its landing pad, is raised for take-off. Once flying, it scans the customer’s fields with a variety of sensors, gathering data on crops and growing conditions. When done, it returns to its box, the lid closes, the data are processed and passed to the farmer, and the drone is recharged.</p>
<p>To avoid aerial collisions, the Scout system employs ground-based acoustic sensors which can hear the engines and propellers of approaching planes from a distance of several kilometres. This allows the position of an incoming flight to be plotted and, if necessary, the drone is instructed to keep clear. The company also plans to survey buildings and other infrastructure. Up to this point, says Reese Mozer, its chief executive, the industry has been “scratching the surface of autonomous drone use”.</p>
<p>Something similar is happening in Britain. In April the Civil Aviation Authority (caa) authorised a firm called sees.ai to carry-out routine bvlos flights, albeit at specified locations. These include a large construction site in Surrey, to the south-west of London. “It is a big step forward and allows us to fly as often as we like without prior authorisation,” says John McKenna, the firm’s chief executive. For the time being, an observer is required on site, but that person need no longer be in constant contact with the flight-monitoring team at the company’s base near Chichester, on the south coast. The firm hopes that this requirement will soon be lifted.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, sees.ai relies on artificial intelligence to operate its uavs. To navigate, the craft employ several cameras and also other systems, including gps, radar and lidar (which uses light instead of reflected radio waves) to build up three-dimensional images of their surroundings. The drones’ software is trained to recognise structures and obstacles, including other aircraft, and to take evasive action if needed. This also lets the craft fly inside tunnels and under oil rigs, where gps and radio-control signals are easily lost.</p>
<p>Although the covid-19 epidemic has delayed some projects, it has spurred others along—especially the delivery of medical supplies. Antwork Technology, which in 2019 received the first licence granted by China’s Civil Aviation Administration for urban uav trials, moved quickly from dropping off orders from Starbucks and kfc around its home town of Hangzhou to ferrying blood supplies and samples.</p>
<p>Antwork placed automated drone “ports” that resemble small shipping containers in the car parks of some of the region’s hospitals and laboratories. Medical staff post samples and supplies through doors in the sides of these ports. They are then loaded automatically into a drone sitting on top of the container. At the end of its journey, a drone lands on another port and deposits its cargo, which can then be picked up from the door.</p>
<p>Antwork’s drones, which navigate using gps and cameras, are governed by a computerised scheduling and monitoring system. Two people at a flight-control centre keep an eye on up to eight drones simultaneously, though for the time being the company also uses some ground observers. Antwork says its drones have cut to a few minutes the time taken to make hospital deliveries that once took half an hour or more by road.</p>
<p>Several big outfits in the West are also keen on the drone-delivery business. Amazon, ups and Alphabet, Google’s parent, all have projects in development. Often these are based in remote areas, where there is little manned aviation to worry about bumping into. ups Flight Forward, for instance, works with local groups delivering medical supplies in Rwanda and Ghana.</p>
<p>Some Nordic countries, where the skies are also relatively clear, have been especially drone-friendly. Alphabet’s drone-delivery subsidiary, Wing, has begun its third year of flights in Helsinki, dropping off groceries and food to homes and some public sites, such as picnic areas. Wing’s drones employ a hook on a cable to pick up goods from merchants and deliver them to customers. The drones fly at an altitude of 30-40 metres, which is well below that at which crewed aircraft typically operate. But just in case, the team overseeing the operation is plugged into a ground-based radio that monitors transponders broadcasting the positions of any aircraft in the area. Wing is also investigating the use of miniature transponders on its drones.</p>
<p>Over in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, one of the longest-established drone-delivery businesses is also still going strong. This is a partnership between aha, a local company, and Flytrex, an Israeli drone-service firm. Together, they have been delivering groceries and meals by uav since 2017. Flytrex is now trying to get something similar off the ground in America, with a delivery service from a local Walmart to homes in Fayetteville, North Carolina. On May 25th it was given permission by the faa to fly above people. For now, its remote pilots still have to keep their craft in view, but ground observers are no longer required. “This is a large step forward and allows us to significantly expand the number of front and backyards we can service,” says Yariv Bash, Flytrex’s boss. The firm’s drones navigate using gps receivers and other sensors—but not cameras, because of fears that Americans might consider them to be intrusive.</p>
<p>Heaven sent<br>Four days earlier than Flytrex, on May 21st, Manna, an Irish drone-delivery company, obtained a new type of European Union operating certificate. Within certain limits, it allows the firm to authorise uav operations on its own recognisance. Manna has been delivering food and groceries in suburban Galway for the past year, carrying out more than 35,000 flights, and now aims to set up operations in other cities.</p>
<p>For such progress to continue, operators will have to prove their uavs have as good an ability as crewed aircraft to detect and avoid one another. “The levels of safety are not going to change between piloted aviation and remotely piloted aviation,” says David Tait, head of innovation at the caa. Mr Tait is open to alternatives about how drones might do that, but thinks it will involve a mixture of technologies, including some that firms like sees.ai and Wing are developing.</p>
<p>One difficulty is that light aircraft flying in uncontrolled airspaces sometimes operate under so-called Visual Flight Rules. These absolve pilots of the obligation to carry transponders and other instrumentation as long as the journey is being made in conditions of clear visibility and they keep their eyes peeled.</p>
<p>Iris Automation, in California, thinks it has a solution to this problem, which is to give uavs the equivalent of a sharp pair of eyes. These come in the form of five small cameras that create a 360° view around a drone. This panoptic image is scanned constantly by ai software which has been trained to recognise different types of aircraft from several kilometres away. The system can calculate an incoming aircraft’s range and heading, and automatically adjust the drone’s flight path if a collision looks likely.</p>
<p>Costing from $9,000, this is a reasonably inexpensive piece of kit in aviation terms. It is already fitted to some drones, but John Damush, Iris’s boss and himself a pilot, is also testing it on a two-seater Piper Cub. He thinks drone-tech like this could help crewed flight too, because, unlike Iris’s drones, pilots don’t have eyes in the backs of their heads. </p>

<p>These images show Betelgeuse, a star that marks one of Orion’s shoulders, as it was in January and December of 2019 and January and March of 2020. They were assembled from data collected in those months by the Very Large Telescope, an array of four instruments in northern Chile. Between November 2019 and March 2020 there was excitement among astronomers when a rapid dimming of this, the second-closest red supergiant to Earth, suggested that a supernova might be about to happen. Regrettably for those who enjoy watching notable astronomical phenomena, it did not, though one is expected within the next 100,000 years or so. Studying these images, as they write in Nature, Miguel Montargès of the Paris Observatory and his colleagues suggest the most likely cause of the diminution was a local cooling of part of the star’s southern hemisphere, associated with an ejection of mass. The much bigger ejection of mass that is a supernova will have to wait.</p>

While there, she spotted the most beautiful fish she had ever seen. It was pale mauve, nearly two metres long, and had silvery markings. Though she had no inkling at the time, it turned out to be part of a group called the coelacanths, hitherto believed to have died out with the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>This find, called Latimeria chalumnae in Courtenay-Latimer’s honour, showed coelacanths are still very much alive. It was hailed as the most important zoological discovery of the century. Now, work just published in Current Biology by Kélig Mahé of the Fisheries Laboratory, in Boulogne, France, suggests that besides having lasted collectively for more than 400m years, coelacanths also hang around for a long time as individuals. Dr Mahé’s study indicates they have similar lifespans to human beings, putting them among the world’s longest-lived vertebrates.</p>
<p>The excitement at Latimeria’s discovery was not just because of the curiosity of its survival. It was also that coelacanths belong to a group which have lobe-shaped fins of a sort thought to have been precursors to the limbs of terrestrial tetrapods. Many experts have therefore sought to study Latimeria more closely. That is, however, hard. Latimeria is reclusive, nocturnal, lives in depths below 100 metres, and is known only from the south-western Indian Ocean and from a second, smaller population, L. menadoensis, near Manado Tua, an island in Indonesia.</p>
<p>In particular, Dr Mahé wanted to know how long Latimeria lives. Previous work, which looked at annual growth rings in its scales, suggested a maximum of 20 years. That does not square with the animal’s slow metabolism and low fecundity, both traits characteristic of long-lived species.</p>
<p>Rather than using standard microscopes, he and his colleagues employed polarised light to study the scales. This revealed extra growth rings so thin that previous work had missed them. Of 27 individuals studied, six turned out to be in their 60s and one was 84.</p>
<p>This was a finding Dr Mahé and his colleagues had more than half expected. What truly surprised them was a discovery made by looking at two unborn youngsters—for Latimeria females bear live young rather than laying eggs. The fetuses’ scales suggested they were five years old, a remarkably long gestation period given the previous vertebrate record of three-and-a-half years, held by the deep-sea frilled shark.</p>
<p>Though interesting, in some ways Dr Mahé’s discovery is bad news. An already-rare, slow-growing animal with a gestation period of half a decade has just about the most extinction-prone profile it is possible to imagine. Latimeria is legally protected, in as much as such protection pertains at sea, and is not a particular target for fisherfolk. But it is already classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It would be both ironic and tragic if, having survived the asteroid impact 66m years ago that did for the dinosaurs, coelacanths were to disappear for good on humanity’s watch. </p>

<p>AN ANTIBODY THERAPY from Regeneron, a firm in upstate New York, improves the survival of patients with covid-19 and offers renewed hope for the treatment of those most seriously ill with the disease. A study in British hospitals found that Regen-Cov saved the lives of many of those unable to make their own antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2. Such “seronegative” individuals constituted about a third of the 9,785 hospital patients in the study. As compared with a control group given standard treatment (either a steroid called dexamethasone or, for the sickest, an anti-inflammatory known as tocilizumab), 20% more patients survived. Regen-Cov also reduced the median length of hospital stays from 17 to 13 days.</p>
<p>Regen-Cov is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, known as casirivimab and imdevimab. Antibodies are immune-system proteins that disable pathogens by locking specifically onto them. Both casirivimab and imdevimab bind to different sites on the coronavirus’s “spike” protein, preventing the virus from infecting cells. Using two antibodies instead of one reduces the risk of the virus evolving resistance to the treatment.</p>
<p>Until now, trials have not made a convincing case for the widespread use of antibody therapies for covid-19. One problem has been a failure to identify a clear group of patients who can benefit from these costly treatments. This is the first study large enough to show that such a therapy reduces mortality in patients admitted to hospital with severe covid-19. A year ago, the same Recovery trial run by British scientists also discovered that dexamethasone would save patients’ lives.</p>
<p>Regen-Cov already has emergency authorisation for use in America, Brazil, Canada, the European Union and India, but remains an investigational drug in Britain and elsewhere. Even if authorisation follows in many other countries, though, access to it is likely to remain extremely restricted.</p>
<p>Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist at the World Health Organisation, said the result was good news, but warned that access to monoclonal-antibody drugs was “limited globally”. A recent study by the Wellcome Trust, a British medical charity, and IAVI, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, showed just how unavailable these drugs are in various parts of the world (see chart). More than three-quarters of the market for them is in America, Canada and Europe. So far, two countries, America and Germany, have bought large supplies of Regen-Cov. In January, America agreed to purchase up to 1.25m doses for $2.6bn. In the same month, Germany spent $487m on 200,000 doses. (Donald Trump was treated with Regen-Cov when he fell ill with covid-19.)</p>
<p>The reasons for this geographical concentration are twofold but related: quantity and price. Production facilities for monoclonal-antibody therapies are few. And, in general, only wealthy countries can afford them. Regen-Cov costs many thousands of dollars a dose.</p>
<p>Dr Swaminathan says more monoclonal-antibody factories need to be established around the world so that such treatments become accessible and affordable. Lack of availability of Regen-Cov will probably become a topic of interest to those who argue that intellectual property in covid-19-related technologies should be waived by the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>So far, trials for covid-19 antibody-therapies have generally been disappointing, but news of Regen-Cov’s success is likely to reinvigorate interest in them. Eli Lilly’s antibody therapy, LY-CoV555, failed to provide benefit to hospital patients in a trial reported last December, while on June 15th a similar drug from AstraZeneca also disappointed when given to those who had been exposed to the virus. These drugs might, however, turn out to be beneficial if they are given to the narrower patient group identified by the Recovery trial.</p>
<p>Should demand for Regen-Cov now increase, though, it is not clear how quickly supply could be improved—even in countries that have the money to pay for it. Monoclonal-antibody production lines are currently used to make cancer and arthritis drugs, which are also badly needed. Moreover, supplies of much of the equipment required, including biobags (giant disposable plastic bags used to make drugs), filters and sterilisation gear, are already stretched thin by demands from vaccine manufacturers. Earlier this year, two pharma companies complained that their ability to make monoclonal antibodies was hampered by shortages of equipment, thanks to the global push to make vaccines.</p>
<p>Any attempt to increase the supply of monoclonal antibodies in coming months could thus compete with vaccine manufacturing. America currently has a lock on much of the supply of equipment and raw materials needed to make vaccines, a hold it maintains through the use of the Defence Production Act. If America chose to use the DPA to support monoclonal antibody production, that might have an impact on vaccine production in countries such as Brazil, Britain and India.</p>
<p>The Recovery study also seems to settle a scientific debate about whether it is worth giving antiviral therapies to covid-19 patients when they arrive in hospital. It is. It had been thought that, by the time a patient arrived, only anti-inflammatory drugs, which treat damage already done by the virus, were relevant. Knowledge that patients who are seronegative are able to benefit from antiviral therapies opens up further lines of investigation for antiviral drugs. In the Recovery trial, untreated seronegative patients were twice as likely to die as those who were able to mount an antibody response.</p>
<p>For doctors, the trial raises an intriguing question. If they have patients languishing at home with covid-19, might it be worth offering a cheap lateral flow test to try to identify those who are not mounting an immune response? If it is possible to spot those most likely to end up in hospital, and stop that happening, it would help to weaken the virus’s hold on patients, and on society at large.</p>

<h1 id="A-midsummer-bug-hunt"><a href="#A-midsummer-bug-hunt" class="headerlink" title="A midsummer bug hunt"></a>A midsummer bug hunt</h1><p>Every June 21st sees a census of the world’s urban microbes</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Depending on where you live, June 21st is either the summer or the winter solstice. For some, this is a moment of celebration, accompanied by strange rituals. And among the celebrants are members of the International Metagenomics and Metadesign of Subways and Urban Biomes Consortium (Metasub). If, in Bogotá, Doha, Kuala Lumpur, London, Minneapolis or any other of some 60 cities around the world, you see on that day someone furtively swabbing a ticket counter, handrail, turnstile or seat in your local underground-railway station, be not afraid. It is just one of Metasub’s volunteers gathering samples of the local microbes.</p>
<p>Metasub’s purpose is to understand the invisible complexes of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses that are life’s smallest representatives. Every year, on June 21st, it co-ordinates an army of small-game hunters who have the task of sampling their city’s public transport. The swabs are then tagged with time of collection, local temperature and humidity, and the nature of the sampled surface, and sent off for genetic sequencing and statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The consortium’s latest findings, published recently in Cell, are based on 4,728 samples collected in 2015, 2016 and 2017. These show that each city has a microbial ecosystem distinctive enough (see chart) to serve as a fingerprint. An algorithm trained on the data could identify the origin of a randomly chosen sample 88% of the time. A few species are ubiquitous. Thirty-one (all bacteria) were found on almost every swab, and a further 1,145 (also, bar brewers’ yeast, bacteria) turned up in over 70% of samples. The vast majority of the 4,246 identifiable species were, however, much more narrowly distributed.</p>
<p>On top of these identifiable organisms are the unknowns. Around half of the critters sequenced had no match in the world’s public genetic databanks, says Daniela Bezdan, a former executive director of Metasub who was one of the study’s leaders. She estimates that more than 1,000 of the bacteria collected, and 10,000 of the viruses, remain unidentified.</p>
<p>Ill met by moonlight…<br>Unidentified organisms are common in such microbiological fishing expeditions, for a proper understanding of microbial biodiversity remains a long way off. But, though intriguing, such hidden neighbours are unlikely to be dangerous. “We know there aren’t any pathogens because people don’t get ridiculously sick,” says David Danko, another of the paper’s authors.</p>
<p>The identities of this dark microbiome’s members are just one of the mysteries that remain to be solved. Another is what regulates a city’s microbial ecology. Strikingly, the pattern observed reflects the more familiar ecology of plants and animals in that equatorial cities have richer ecosystems than those nearer the poles (microbial diversity declines at a rate of seven species per degree of latitude). No one knows for sure why this pattern pertains for macroscopic creatures. That it is also true for microbes may add insight.</p>
<p>On top of latitudinal variation, three other patterns stood out. Coastal cities share characteristics that inland ones lack. So do those at high altitude, compared with those which are low-lying. And so do cities with higher human-population densities.</p>
<p>At the moment, Metasub is still in the position of the early botanists and zoologists, gathering information about what, exactly, is out there. As the underlying patterns become clearer, though, such surveys could have practical benefits. They should, for example, enable public-health bodies to monitor and map the spread of diseases, and identify harmful new species. They could also permit the monitoring of bacteria carrying genes that confer resistance to antibiotics. Metasub has found such genes to be widespread, but unevenly distributed. They were less common in Oceania and the Middle East. Why, is so far impossible to say.</p>
<p>The current paper looks only at dna from the samples, but Metasub has now started surveying rna as well. This is particularly pertinent to viruses, many of which, such as the coronavirus currently sweeping the world, store their genes as rna, not dna. As the team gears up for its next collection day, it hopes the data it gathers will grant a more accurate portrait of the role of viruses in cities, and provide insights into the spread of covid-19. </p>

<p>The Plague Year. By Lawrence Wright. Knopf; 336 pages; $28. Allen Lane; £20</p>
<p>In april 2020 Lawrence Wright published a novel, “The End of October”, about a global pandemic and the political meltdown and mass fatalities it causes in America. Health officials struggle to enforce lockdown rules in the face of conspiracy theorists, feuding rivals, outraged libertarians and a useless president who, washing his hands of the calamity, foists it onto his deputy, a former governor and radio-show host. Then Mr Wright set about writing the true story of America and covid-19. It is not that different.</p>
<p>A veteran journalist at the New Yorker, who wrote a bestselling account of the origins of the 9/11 catastrophe, Mr Wright makes no great claim for his prescience. Plagues, after all, have been common throughout history. And a two-year pandemic of the deadly sars disease, which emerged in China in late 2002 and spread to several other countries, had raised the threat warning. It was only a matter of time before an even deadlier virus, taking advantage of teeming human populations, ravaged wildlife habitats and opaque government, jumped between species or escaped from a laboratory. According to a study published in 2019 by the Economist Intelligence Unit and others, no country was ready for it.</p>
<p>Still, the study’s authors considered America at least better placed than the rest. Its public-health institutions, especially the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc), were the world’s best. And under Barack Obama, who worried a lot about pandemics, the federal government had taken extra defensive steps. During the transition to the Trump administration, Mr Obama’s team handed over a long guide to combating a “pathogen of pandemic potential”. It included a breakdown of relevant capabilities across the federal agencies, and the order in which they should be brought to bear. So why, when Mr Wright submitted his manuscript in late 2020, had America performed so badly?</p>
<p>At the time, its death toll from covid-19 was 375,000; now it is 600,000. Among the most affected countries, only Italy and Britain had then lost a higher proportion of their populations, at least by the official counts (more recent modelling suggests death rates have been a lot higher in numerous other places). “The Plague Year” is Mr Wright’s account of how this happened.</p>
<p>He identifies three main reasons. First, China’s evasiveness and opacity mitigated America’s technological prowess. Had the cdc got the early access to the outbreak in Wuhan that it had requested, it would have pinpointed a crucial difference between the viruses that cause sars and covid-19: the new one could be spread asymptomatically, which made it far more dangerous. As it was, the cdc did not understand that until late February 2020, by which time the virus was already raging in America.</p>
<p>Not that the cdc fully grasped its prevalence even then, having failed to develop an effective covid-19 test. This was the second reason for America’s plight. Weeks after many rich countries had launched mass testing, the cdc was still investigating why its test kit didn’t work. Many of the kits, it turned out, had been contaminated with the coronavirus at the “filthy” cdc laboratory where they were made. By the time South Korea had tested 65,000 people, America had managed to test only 500.</p>
<p>Having thereby lost control of the virus, America also failed to implement adequate social distancing and, in particular, mask-wearing. This ensured it fared worse not only than South Korea and other well-organised Asian countries, but also some European ones. The cause of this third fatal glitch was one Mr Wright had foreseen in his novel: the malignity of Donald Trump and incompetence of his administration.</p>
<p>Even Americans who are not in denial about that reality may struggle to remember the many proofs of it; the bloody insurrection on Capitol Hill that Mr Trump engineered in January has come to dominate the memory. Moreover his response to the crisis—the biggest test of his presidency—was often so unconscionable and bizarre that, as time passes, it seems almost incredible. In his characteristic style, Mr Wright provides many small sketches of people touched by covid-19—from whizzy scientists like Barney Graham (“six-foot-five, with a grey goatee and a laconic manner”), to victims like 96-year-old Jim Miller, a D-Day veteran who died of the disease in a cruelly mismanaged home for old soldiers. But the book’s main character is Mr Trump, and its main service is in weighing his responsibility for the disaster.</p>
<p>Devil take the hindmost<br>His efforts to purge Mr Obama’s legacy and his predilection for sycophants put America at a disadvantage from the start. The pandemic plan was ditched; the heads of the cdc and the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert Redfield and Alex Azar, were both inadequate. There was nonetheless a moment when it seemed Mr Trump might conceivably rise to the historic occasion. In a televised address on March 11th 2020 he acknowledged the pandemic’s gravity, recommended social distancing and called on the country to “put politics aside”. In Mr Wright’s telling, that moment lasted about five days.</p>
<p>Instead of taking charge of the crisis, Mr Trump told state governors they were on their own—and must fight it out in the red-hot global market for ventilators, masks and other kit. It was an unprecedented abnegation of federal authority, guaranteeing needless wastage and chaos. “Price is always a component,” Mr Trump told Charlie Baker, the governor of Massachusetts, after he complained that the federal government kept gazumping the state’s orders of masks and other equipment.</p>
<p>Having cut the governors loose, Mr Trump began undermining their public-health efforts, in an almost psychopathically self-serving bid to politicise the pandemic. He talked up the miraculous properties of hydroxychloroquine, a quack cure peddled on Fox News. He denounced state lockdowns. By tweeting “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA!”, he launched vigilantes onto the streets of those states. Some plotted to kidnap Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, in what now looks like a dress rehearsal for the insurrection in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr Trump’s opposition to mask- wearing—he thought it made him look unmanly—made it a litmus test of partisan identification. This led to many needless infections and deaths. In Mr Wright’s view, he was even more directly responsible for some of them. Since all the guests were tested, he thinks Mr Trump the likeliest infection source of a “superspreader” event at the White House in October.</p>
<p>His leadership did not merely undercut America’s strengths. It also exacerbated its weaknesses. Partisan division was among the many pre-existing national conditions that the virus laid bare—a list that includes the hollowing of American manufacturing supply-chains; the disproportionate suffering of black Americans; chronic obesity; and extreme disparities in health-care quality. Of course, America’s encounter with covid-19 continues. Perhaps the most glaring deficiency of Mr Wright’s book is that it concludes just as America was on the brink of launching, from a faltering start, one of the world’s most impressive mass vaccination campaigns (an effort that owes much to the Trump administration’s stimulation of the development and supply of vaccines). Yet even with that hindsight it is hard to be optimistic about the country the pandemic exposed.</p>
<p>In his most hopeful moment, Mr Wright speculates that “perhaps covid-19 was the force that America needed—to be humbled, to reckon with itself, to once again attempt to create the democracy it had always intended to be.” But even before those words were published 74m Americans had voted to give Mr Trump another four years at the helm. And among the Republicans now jostling to succeed him are many lesser covid incompetents—such as Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, whose opposition to lockdown measures led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. Covid-19’s terrible cost to America is not only measurable in jobs and lives. Its other great toll is accountability. </p>

<p>Animal. By Lisa Taddeo. 336 pages; $27.99. Bloomsbury Circus; £16.99</p>
<p>In “three women”, Lisa Taddeo’s first book (published in 2019), she recounted the often disturbing sexual histories of three American women whom the author had spent years interviewing. Her decision to write from the perspective of her subjects—but in the third person, traditionally a novelistic approach—made it hard to gauge the extent of her creative licence. But the main criticism of her mostly well-received book involved its focus on characters who seemed to have little or no agency. A middle-aged restaurateur is coerced by her husband into sleeping with other men. A young woman goes to court to accuse her former teacher, a married father, of having groomed her for sex.</p>
<p>As if by way of balance, Ms Taddeo has now swung to the other extreme, with a compulsive debut novel narrated by a wronged woman out to avenge the abuse of male power. Joan is 36 and on the run from New York after the gory death (in mysterious circumstances) of Vic, her older, married lover. Lying low in California, she falls in with Lenny, a widower suffering from dementia. In his confusion, Lenny mistakes Joan for the wife he ill-treated; the crimes to which he confesses boost her resolve to find redress for the miseries she has endured.</p>
<p>So begins a provocative psychological thriller that sets out to subvert #MeToo-era notions of victimhood, at the same time portraying men as almost uniformly vile. The story sags in places, not least during the novel’s midsection, when Joan recalls her girlhood experience of desire in conversation with a yoga teacher, a sequence that resembles an offcut from “Three Women”. Joan’s narration runs melodramatically hot and can be overly portentous (“sometimes it’s better to kill someone than to leave them”). Yet teasing hints about “the thing that I would end up doing” build tension, as do allusions to the death of Joan’s parents when she was a child, an event clarified in an explosive climax.</p>
<p>Ms Taddeo’s lurid and relentless focus on horror, from child abuse and rape to suicide and miscarriage, might be taken for relish. Yet as in “Three Women”, her determination to tear the veil from experiences that normally remain hidden makes this startling writer valuable. </p>

<p>The view from the steps of Sarah Baartman Hall at the University of Cape Town (uct) is a reminder of the city’s natural beauty and difficult history. The shadow of Table Mountain looms over the neoclassical building, renamed in 2018 to commemorate Baartman, a Khoisan woman who in 1810 was shipped to Europe to appear in freak shows. She replaced Leander Starr Jameson, a lackey of Cecil Rhodes who staged a calamitous attempt to start a war on behalf of his patron. Until 2015 a statue of Rhodes stood at the bottom of the steps, gazing out at the Atlantic Ocean and the city he made his own, the headquarters of his southern African empire.</p>
<p>“And there”, says Ujala Satgoor, director of uct’s libraries, looking to her right, “is the famous Jagger library.” Or rather, there it was. On April 18th fireballs from a conflagration on the mountainside engulfed the building and nearby halls of residence (the cause of the blaze is unclear). The contents endured the twin effects of flames and, once firemen arrived, hosepipes, leaving thousands of works charred or sodden.</p>
<p>Because they were held in a basement, some books of the highest monetary value were spared. These were mostly from the Western canon. But in a bitter twist for a library that may have done more than any other to enhance scholarship of Africa, the most extensive damage was to its African-studies collection. Almost 100,000 of its roughly 130,000 books were destroyed (the count is ongoing). “It was truly a disaster,” says Ms Satgoor.</p>
<p>The African-studies collection dates back to 1953, five years after the introduction of apartheid in South Africa, and four years before Ghana catalysed decolonisation by gaining independence. At the time, “African studies” was dominated by white male authors. But a succession of quietly radical uct librarians travelled extensively to acquire materials by African scholars, using funding from the Oppenheimer family, founders of Anglo American, the mining giant. Slowly they built the largest store of research materials for African scholars on the continent.</p>
<p>Ms Satgoor recalls stumbling through the rubble and finding only covers of rare dictionaries, their pages incinerated. Gone were early translations of local languages from countries such as the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Gabon and South Africa. Soon after the fire, a number of San and Khoi scholars (two groups indigenous to the area around Cape Town who, over time, were termed Khoisan, like Baartman) noted that the blow is particularly painful for their field, as much of their oral traditions was lost during the colonial era. “This devastation reminds us of when the great libraries in Alexandria, Timbuktu and Rio were destroyed,” the scholars wrote.</p>
<p>Also thought gone are thousands of official documents. Over several decades librarians collated copies of parliamentary debates, political-party minutes, inquiries and so on, to help African historians. The material included many papers related to underground activities during apartheid. The fire severely damaged a complementary audiovisual archive, which included rare footage from political protests.</p>
<p>Then there was a unique collection of nearly 3,500 African films. One of these, wrote Jeremy Seekings and Chris Saunders, academics from uct, in a recent article for the Daily Maverick, a South African outlet, was the pioneering “Afrique sur Seine”; it was made in 1955, when Africans in France’s colonies were not allowed to make films in their home countries. Others were banned works sent to Cape Town in secret—a film about the Gukurahundi massacres in Zimbabwe in the 1980s was dispatched in an envelope labelled “Auntie Flo’s home movies”.</p>
<p>Ms Satgoor began the salvage operation before the embers cooled. Some books will be saved with the help of cold storage and moisture-sucking fans. She has received dozens of offers of help, including from universities with copies of lost books and films. But it will take time to rebuild a resource that had an importance greater than the sum of its parts. Walking through the ash-strewn warren of the library, an incongruous smell of charred damp in the air, Ms Satgoor talks of her admiration for earlier librarians who built such a “provocative” collection. Restoring it falls to her. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Collision Course. By Hans Greimel and William Sposato. Harvard Business Review Press; 256 pages; $30 and £22</p>
<p>The main events of the scandal that brought down Carlos Ghosn, whose restless energy made other globetrotting bosses look work-shy, are appropriately book-ended by flights on corporate jets. The drama began with grainy television footage of Japanese prosecutors boarding the plane that delivered an unwitting Mr Ghosn to his arrest in Tokyo in November 2018. It culminated in his skipping bail on several charges of financial impropriety around a year later. Stripped of his leadership of a giant conglomerate, he was smuggled out of Japan on another private jet, this time hidden in a box.</p>
<p>Because of that clandestine escape, “Collision Course” by Hans Greimel and William Sposato, two Tokyo-based journalists, at times reads like a spy thriller. But their main aim and achievement is to give the clearest account yet of the deep-rooted causes of Mr Ghosn’s predicament. Underpinning the entire tale—and Mr Ghosn’s status as a corporate superstar—was Renault’s rescue in 1999 of near-bankrupt Nissan, an alliance, later joined by Mitsubishi, which he built into the world’s biggest carmaker.</p>
<p>The terms of Nissan’s bail-out gave Renault, in which the French government has a large shareholding, control of the Japanese firm, but Nissan got no say over Renault in return. The alliance stopped short of a full merger, which, in the car industry, had usually ended in disaster. This arrangement led to seething resentment at Nissan, which gradually became the bigger company and the main source of profits. Mr Ghosn kept a lid on the tensions between the two carmakers—their engineers rarely agreed on anything—through the force of his personality.</p>
<p>But they boiled over as Mr Ghosn sought, at the French government’s behest, to make the alliance “irreversible”. Nissan read this as code for a full merger that would cement Gallic dominance. This, claims Mr Ghosn, led some in Nissan to manufacture charges in order to get rid of him. Nissan’s version is that he was a greedy tyrant who regarded the Japanese firm as a personal bank account. This claim gained more credence when French prosecutors also began an investigation of Mr Ghosn, including into the funding of a lavish party thrown for his wife’s birthday at the palace of Versailles—a far cry from his Japanese prison cell, where a bowl of rice gruel counted as luxury.</p>
<p>The authors point to a clash of corporate cultures as the reason he may have sought to circumvent pay disclosure using a deferred-pay scheme, which Nissan claimed broke the law. In Japan and France ceos are paid far less than equivalent American bosses; doubtless he thought his skills should be properly rewarded by global standards. The competing narratives were never aired in court, though, after Japan’s criminal-justice system—which relies on prolonged incarceration and intense interrogation to obtain a confession—collided with Mr Ghosn’s stubborn refusal to admit any wrongdoing. Eventually released on bail, he fled in the belief that he would not receive a fair trial and would remain under house arrest for years.</p>
<p>Some readers may be dismayed by the authors’ reluctance to speculate on the verdict should the trial have gone ahead (they conclude that, given the “arcane” accusations of financial irregularities, a “ruling is likely to be just as abstruse”). But the end result is that Mr Ghosn remains trapped, these days in Lebanon, where he is safe from the international arrest warrants that might be executed should he board any more corporate jets. Meanwhile the alliance he created, languishing without its leader, may yet break apart. </p>

<p>Did a mistaken translation put rovers on Mars? In 1877 Giovanni Schiaparelli, an Italian astronomer, used his then state-of-the-art telescope to view and describe what he called “canali” on the planet. English translators leapt on the discovery of what they rendered as “canals”. There followed a frenzy of speculation that Mars might be inhabited, which left a deep mark on the human imagination. To this day “Martian” is a synonym for alien life.</p>
<p>But the Italian word could also have been translated as “channels”. Which did Schiaparelli mean? In some writings he was careful to discourage firm conclusions about life on Mars; in others, he encouraged exactly those conclusions. It is almost as though canali let him have both “channels” and “canals” in his mind at the same time.</p>
<p>The story is told in “Dancing on Ropes”, Anna Aslanyan’s new book about translators’ and interpreters’ roles at critical moments in history. It is full of lively stories like that of Schiaparelli’s canals. Ms Aslanyan is herself both a translator and interpreter (in the argot of the profession, the former works in writing, the latter in speech), and enlists both practical experience and archival history. She leaves the reader with an awed respect for the translator’s task.</p>
<p>Ideally, interpreters are invisible, and two people who do not share a language will feel they are conversing directly. But this ideal is virtually unachievable. Speakers cut off their own interpreters. Listeners are rude to them, as if they (not the actual interlocutor) had said something objectionable. The poor linguist in the middle can thus be tempted to clean up or soften a rude remark; Ms Aslanyan relates some enjoyable tales from the Russian interpreter for Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s bawdy former prime minister.</p>
<p>The job is draining. In “The Language Game”, Ewandro Magalhães, a Brazilian interpreter, described how, at the Nuremberg trials, small booths hooked up with telephone wires were first used for interpretation into several languages. Staff got one day off in three, and shifts were capped at 45 minutes. Even so, an interpreter said, four months in Nuremberg made her feel ten years older. Perhaps only the Ottomans, who made “dragoman” a powerful job—the grand dragoman was simultaneously deputy foreign minister—gave interpreters the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Translation is different: usually solitary, seemingly more leisurely, but now under tremendous economic pressure. In the digital era, everyone competes with everyone and buyers often simply take the lowest bid (or Google Translate). The literary work that cannot be done by a faceless contractor or a machine may not always pay the bills, but it at least provides stimulation. Ms Aslanyan recalls trying to transpose a Russian spoken in rural Ukraine into an English that carried the same tones; after she and a collaborator considered and rejected a Scottish inflection, they went with snatches of West Country English. Since 2016 the overseers of the International Booker Prize for fiction have split the prize-money equally between authors and their translators.</p>
<p>Ms Aslanyan says a mistranslation also played a role in America’s atomic bombing of Japan in 1945. An official statement said that the Japanese would “mokusatsu” the Potsdam Declaration that called on Japan to surrender. The verb can mean things including “to offer no comment on” and “to kill with silence”, but also “to treat with silent contempt”. The Americans leaned towards the latter interpretation—a defiant insult—helping seal Hiroshima’s fate.</p>
<p>Devotees of Esperanto, an artificial language, have long hoped that understanding would promote peace between peoples. Douglas Adams, author of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”, satirically took the opposite stance. In his fantasy, the Babel Fish—which, once stuck in your ear, instantly provides perfect translation of all languages—is responsible for more wars than anything else in history.</p>
<p>But the most eloquent comment on translation may come from José Ortega y Gasset, a Spanish philosopher whom Ms Aslanyan cites. Two words in two languages are never exact translations of each other, he said. More than that, though, no two people mean the same thing by the same word (with the possible exception of some scientific terms). Translation, therefore, is a “utopian” endeavour, an impossible act of perfect mind-reading. That does not mean it should not be attempted—but those who try should be “good utopians” who know they can never succeed.</p>

<h1 id="Obituary-—Edward-de-Bono-died-on-June-9th"><a href="#Obituary-—Edward-de-Bono-died-on-June-9th" class="headerlink" title="(Obituary)—Edward de Bono died on June 9th"></a>(Obituary)—Edward de Bono died on June 9th</h1><p>The father of lateral thinking and “Six Thinking Hats” was 88</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>The letter was unexpected, but not undeserved. It contained an invitation to a Symposium in Athens. Over the years Edward de Bono had been to hundreds of these affairs. Some were seminars, some consultations or lecturing, all based on his much-acclaimed books. He had produced 70 of them, including “How To Be More Interesting”, “How To Have a Beautiful Mind”, “Edward de Bono’s Textbook of Wisdom” and “Think! Before It’s Too Late”. That last was the message he carried loud and clear as he jetted from city to city and boardroom to boardroom. He was teaching the world a new way of thought, the most important for 2,300 years.</p>
<p>A gathering in Greece was alluring. He was a man of the Mediterranean himself, born in Malta to a family boasting seven generations of doctors. On his mother’s side, he was possibly descended from Napoleon. It was at school that he was first called “Genius” and allowed to skip years. From there he sailed into both Oxford and Cambridge, to do two doctorates and several years of research into physiology and psychology. His study of self-organising systems such as the kidneys and the glands convinced him that the brain, too, could be organised differently. It could be taught to operate creatively, surprisingly and “outside the box”. His preferred term was “lateral thinking”. With that, he had made the most important discovery since the time of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, the infamous Gang of Three, as he called them. It was they who had sent the invitation. They were eager, like all the rest, to consult him.</p>
<p>And he had much to say to those gentlemen. Centuries since, they had imposed on Western brains the tyranny of vertical thinking. That method proceeded by pure logic. At every step, one had to be right. It was characterised by conflict, argument, arrogance and rejection of unusual ideas. In schools, it wasted two-thirds of society’s natural talent. The concepts it laid down hardened into inadequate or over-complex ways of doing things. There was nothing inherently wrong with logical thinking, as there was nothing inherently wrong with the forward gears on a car. But reverse gear was needed too, to rearrange the pattern or get out of a blind alley. An example: waste from a factory is polluting water for people downstream. You could install expensive filtration, or rehouse the people. Or you could require the factory to take its own water from downstream. Simplicity itself, and perfect sense.</p>
<p>As soon as he proposed his method, in “The Mechanism of Mind” (1969), it caught on like wildfire. Lateral thinking was taken up by Siemens, DuPont, Goldman Sachs, bt, ba and Federal Express, among many. (At Siemens, product-development time fell by half.) It was adopted in schools from Venezuela to Australia to China. In Britain he was brought in in 1998 to shake up the hidebound and exclusive civil service. During the Soviet Union’s perestroika, his books were top reading in Moscow. A seminar on his system for the Australian cricket team led to the total thrashing of England in the Ashes series. His detractors, silly little idiots, held that nothing in his method was new and most of it obvious. The brilliant results spoke for themselves. So did the flow of seekers to his online Effective Thinking course, his Practical Thinking Training courses (with, in 1995, more than 400 instructors in 27 countries) and his World Academy of New Thinking in Malta. He made a very decent living from it all.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it might be hard to impress the Gang of Three with them. Pupils at the original Symposium had been overwhelmed by the vertical thinking of Socrates. “Absolutely”, “Of course”, and “Naturally not”, they had answered, not daring to risk the put-down of a “No”. The de Bono method, by contrast, proposed “Po”. This was a language laxative, a provocation thrown into a discussion to loosen things up. It might even be nonsense on its face, such as “Po: Why are wheels round?” Or it might put two things side by side, a caterpillar and a horse, or food and a shoe, to see what thoughts arose from this rearranging. All would be assumed to have value. There was no “No”. Another example might occur in a discussion about picking apples. Rather than arduously reaching up to pick, why not attract the apples to the ground? Or remove the trees from the apples? Well worth exploring.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, his best bet for this new Symposium was a talk on his Six Thinking Hats. He could take a set along, six toppers in good strong colours. The thinking behind the hats was to make meetings quicker and more productive by taking ego out of them. Instead, those attending wore hats to grasp other points of view. A black hat stood for caution and realism. White meant facts. Green was for creativity, red for feelings, blue for process. Yellow signalled optimism. Trivial, said the idiots again. But major corporations the world over found it shortened meeting times by half. Thousands of schools used it to make debate civilised. In the platinum mines of South Africa, illiterate workers from 14 different tribes learned from it to get on together. In Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf was moved by it to talk peace with India. No doubt it had uses, too, in the Middle East, though his neatest lateral solution in that case was to ship out Marmite yeast extract to both Arabs and Israelis, to increase the zinc in their diets and thus make them less irritable with each other.</p>
<p>The thought of the coming Symposium was now much jollier. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle would soon be lounging in their hats, eager to hear him. The wine, too, would be flowing, and the flute-girls playing. He might even intrigue them with some of his more speculative lateral thoughts. For example: why not reduce awkward conversations to simple numerical code? So that “This relationship is long dead, we both know it, but we hang on for fear of the unknown” would become “14/4”? Or why not save wine from spoiling by decanting each large jar, on purchase, into smaller screw-top containers? Or (ignoring the gang’s full beards) had they ever thought, while shaving, of keeping the razor still and moving their heads instead? In fact, it worked rather better. Before the evening was out, they too would be toasting his genius. </p>
