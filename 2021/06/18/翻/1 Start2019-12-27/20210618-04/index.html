<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Joe biden was 12 in 1955 when Dwight Eisenhower sat down in Geneva with Nikita Khrushchev for the first bilateral summit between the leaders of America and the Soviet Union. The current American president was a 42-year-old senator working on arms control when Ronald Reagan sat on a sofa with Mikhail Gorbachev for the first time in the same city, taking what turned out to be the first step towards ending the cold war.</p>
<p>On June 16th it was Mr Biden’s turn to encounter Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, who has undermined many of the achievements of the post-cold-war order and revived some of the worst Soviet practices. But although the location was the same, the plot was different. This was not a summit between two superpowers holding the fate of the world in their hands. Nor was it an attempt to have another reset of the relationship, as Barack Obama tried. Rather it was something a bit murkier.</p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting was to manage an ongoing confrontation by firming up red lines, clarifying the rules of engagement and getting a measure of each other’s weaknesses. The only concrete agreements were to start a new round of nuclear talks and to return ambassadors to their posts. These are both small but solid wins. The fact that this return to diplomacy produced a sigh of relief was a measure of how difficult relations have become since Russia annexed Crimea and launched a war in Ukraine in 2014.</p>
<p>The summit was a departure from the psychodrama of Donald Trump’s relationship with Mr Putin. American diplomats shudder to recall a press conference in Helsinki at which Mr Trump said he had no reason to distrust Mr Putin. There was no joint press conference this time. But after less than four hours meeting in an 18th-century villa, Mr Putin and Mr Biden knew where the other man stood: cyber-attacks on vital infrastructure were off limits; disputes over Ukraine and Belarus should not be resolved by military means. Killing Alexei Navalny, the jailed opposition leader, would bring devastating consequences but, regrettable as human-rights abuses are, they should be treated separately from security. In cold-war parlance, there was more than a hint of détente.</p>
<p>Mr Biden has recast the relationship in grand terms, as a contest between democracy and autocracy, represented this week by Russia, though principally by China. He put his meeting with Mr Putin in the context of renewed unity within the g7 and nato. His style and rhetoric were meant to highlight how different he is from Mr Trump. His mantra is “to restore predictability and stability” to America’s relations with Russia, to create a basis for relations to be workmanlike if also adversarial, rather as they were with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The problem was that the man who sat across from him in Geneva was not a Soviet-style leader constrained by ideology, party hierarchy and, most important, the experience of common victory in the second world war.</p>
<p>He is, rather, a product of the Soviet collapse. He presides over a kleptocratic regime dominated by violent security services. It is a regime that cares more about wealth than ideology, and is preoccupied with its own survival rather than a global contest with America, let alone the interests of the Russian people. It thrives on disorder. It has invaded neighbouring countries, poisoned its opponents, and waged cyber- and information warfare against the West. Mr Putin talks of restoring Russia’s greatness while allowing his cronies to loot its resources.</p>
<p>The danger is that Mr Biden’s tough-sounding rhetoric will be a substitute for tough action, rather than a precursor to it. The genesis of the summit in this respect may be more illustrative than its outcome.</p>
<p>In March, two months after his inauguration, which coincided with the return to Russia and imprisonment of Mr Navalny, Mr Biden called Mr Putin a murderer. Mr Putin smirked, ominously wished Mr Biden good health and suggested they meet and debate on television. Mr Biden’s office replied that the president had better things to do that weekend.</p>
<p>A few weeks later Mr Putin massed a vast army on Ukraine’s eastern border. At the same time, he brought down the entire weight of his domestic-security apparatus to crush Mr Navalny’s movement and purge Russian politics of meaningful dissent. Some dissidents fled the country. Mr Putin suffocated the few remaining independent media outlets by labelling them “foreign agents”, thus scaring off advertisers. To drive home the message to Washington, Russian spooks hacked into American human-rights groups and think-tanks that criticised Mr Putin.</p>
<p>Russia’s Ukrainian war-drums got Mr Biden’s attention; and he suggested a summit. His team hoped that making a concession to Mr Putin’s vanity would incline him to cause less trouble. Meanwhile, they hoped to project a new example of democratic vitality and global leadership.</p>
<p>Mr Biden then gave Mr Putin another win, this time overruling the objections of his top aides by waiving sanctions on one of the firms behind the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline that Russia is building under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing Poland and Ukraine. Mr Biden meant this as a concession not to Russia but to Germany and to reality (the pipeline is 90% complete). Yet Mr Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, who learned about America’s decision only from the media, considered it a big win for Russia.</p>
<p>Mr Putin has signalled that he, too, is interested in a “predictable and stable” relationship—by which he means that America should predictably stay out of Russia’s affairs and its backyard. In the hope of drawing his own red lines, he pre-empted the summit by outlawing Mr Navalny’s movement as “extremist”, threatening to annihilate Ukraine were nato to move closer, and backing Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian dictator, who last month hijacked a Ryanair flight in order to arrest an opponent.</p>
<p>If Mr Biden needs to dial down tensions with Russia so that he can focus on a more pressing contest with China, Mr Putin needs a form of détente with America, so that he can focus on the more urgent business of repressing dissent and rebuilding his empire. “Over the past few years the Kremlin appears to have come to the conclusion that it cannot simultaneously eliminate risks to its rule at home while also fighting against the West at an ever-rising economic cost,” says Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank.</p>
<p>Whereas Mr Biden, like Mr Obama before him, sees Russia as a distraction, Mr Putin sees America and its values as an existential threat. “If Putin were to fulfil Biden’s wish-list, release all political prisoners, withdraw from Crimea and Donbas, [and] concede to the West on other key points, it would result in the collapse of the existing regime,” says Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a think-tank. In his press conference Mr Putin tried to justify his repression by calling his political opponents American agents and pointing to America’s own injustices, from gun crime to Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>For now, Mr Putin’s gambit appears to have paid off. Progress on nuclear agreements and the return of ambassadors lend a veneer of legitimacy to a rogue regime that is prepared to sacrifice lives to protect its wealth and power. But it remains to be seen whether the summit, and the ones to come, will make Mr Putin’s regime less dangerous. Fiona Hill, who served on the National Security Council under Mr Trump, argues that Mr Putin’s kleptocracy has become one of the biggest security threats for Western governments, along with crippling cyber-attacks. “We have to show that we are prepared to hold the line with action, not just words. Otherwise we are simply inviting Russia to move in.” </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>For years it has been an eyesore. Stripped of its marble facing and defaced with graffiti, Tirana’s pyramid was falling down. Now workmen are busily clambering about on top of it, as work has begun on restoring the Albanian capital’s most unusual building. Completed in 1988, the same year as I.M. Pei’s Paris pyramid, Tirana’s shabbier version is getting a new lease of life.</p>
<p>The building was put up as a museum and memorial to Enver Hoxha, Albania’s Stalinist dictator, who died in 1985. It was designed by his daughter and her husband, who said their inspiration was the mountain that rises above the city. Its real significance was obvious to everyone. Mr Hoxha had been Albania’s pharaoh and he would be remembered for thousands of years. In private, Albanians grumbled. They were poor, a pyramid seemed rather extravagant and besides, Hoxha was a mass-murdering monster. When communism collapsed in Albania in 1991, the memorial-cum-museum was promptly closed.</p>
<p>Ever since, no one has quite known what to do with the thing. nato opened a regional headquarters in it during the war in neighbouring Kosovo in 1999. Sali Berisha, a post-communist leader, started an abortive project to convert it into a new national theatre. The structure became “a Frankenstein”, says Erion Veliaj, Tirana’s mayor.</p>
<p>Last year Mr Veliaj came under fire for demolishing the existing, miniature national theatre, which was built during the second world war by the occupying Italians out of (oddly enough) compacted paper matches. Mr Veliaj shrugs. Leaders sometimes have to go against the flow, he reckons: “Only dead fish go with it.” By contrast, his decision to restore the pyramid is rather popular.</p>
<p>When the restoration is finished the pyramid will be faced with staircases, so people can climb to the top. And an organisation that Mr Veliaj came across in Armenia, which teaches teens how to code, will work inside what was once a shrine to a communist tyrant. There are worse uses.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>The first sign of trouble on the Rhine, Europe’s busiest inland waterway, was when the river cruises and hotel ships disappeared. Then the cargo vessels got smaller, or simply stopped sailing; goods like coal were shifted to trains. Water levels fell low enough to expose unexploded wartime bombs. These grim scenes, described by Florian Krekel of the Bingen office of Germany’s Waterways and Shipping Administration, date from autumn 2018, when a long drought so depleted the waters along this scenic part of the Rhine that navigation became near-impossible. Manufacturers on the river had to slash production, exporters were cut off from world markets and petrol stations in Cologne had to raise prices. The disruption shaved 0.2 percentage points off German gdp, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.</p>
<p>Over two-thirds of Germany’s land area was afflicted by the great drought of 2018. Soon afterwards climate change shot up the list of voters’ priorities (see chart). And as its effects, potential or actual, on Germany’s waterways, forests and farms have become harder to ignore, it has remained at or near the top ever since. Germany’s parties, gearing up for an election in late September, are reacting accordingly.</p>
<p>The Green Party, which approved its manifesto at a party pow-wow last weekend, has naturally placed climate policy at the centre of its offer. But the centre-right Christian Democrats (cdu), their Christian Social Union (csu) allies in Bavaria, and the Social Democrats (spd), who currently rule in coalition, have also had to put their imprints on it. Parliament is debating a revision to Germany’s climate law, spurred by a constitutional-court ruling that made the government tighten its climate goals. In 1990, in the newly reunified country’s first election, the Greens boasted, “Everyone is talking about Germany. We’re talking about the weather.” Three decades on, their rivals have fallen into line.</p>
<p>Yet that may not work to the Greens’ advantage. Although climate’s prominence in Germany’s debate is new, the old tactic of tarring the Greens as a bossy Verbotspartei (“prohibition party”) still looks potent. When Annalena Baerbock, the party’s chancellor-candidate, recently said petrol prices would have to rise, the cdu/csu and spd hammered her for building climate policy on the backs of poor motorists. Armin Laschet, her cdu rival, says the Greens threaten Germans’ sacred right to an annual jolly in Majorca. “People in the cities telling people in the countryside how to live—it’s crazy,” grumbles Jochen Ratzenberger, a Green-sceptic Rhineland winemaker. The Greens have slumped in polls.</p>
<p>Their response is twofold. First, to tamp down excesses in their own ranks. At the Green congress the leadership saw off activists who wanted bolder promises to increase Germany’s new carbon price. Second, to provide a cheerful narrative for the climate struggle. Robert Habeck, who leads the party with Ms Baerbock, delivered a barnstorming speech linking climate action to heroic themes like freedom and justice. More prosaically, the Greens have a plan to redistribute dividends from carbon tariffs to Germany’s less well-off.</p>
<p>But voters distrust such schemes. Nor are they wild about making specific sacrifices, such as paying more for petrol or ditching meat. Germany must now reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 65% (from 1990 levels) by 2030, in order to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. This will have a dramatic impact on everything from retrofitting housing stock to the speed with which German petrolheads are weaned off the combustion engine. “Most people have no clue what it will take for Germany to achieve its goals,” says Anita Engels, a climate sociologist at Hamburg University. Few politicians seem inclined to tell them.</p>
<p>In theory, the cdu/csu’s emphasis on market methods for climate action versus the Greens’ penchant for regulation could make for “healthy debate” in the campaign, reckons Ottmar Edenhofer, head of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Some younger cdu mps, sniffing the political wind, would indeed like to take the fight to the Greens. But others doubt the wisdom of battling on Green turf, and they seem to have Mr Laschet’s ear. A leaked draft of the cdu’s imminent manifesto offered little detail on climate.</p>
<p>A new report by More in Common, an international group that works on social polarisation, finds a broad consensus across Germany for climate action, alongside concerns about fairness and a sense of personal helplessness. Two-thirds of Germans it polled want binding climate rules. “Politicians are threatening social cohesion by not acting,” says Laura-Kristine Krause, the outfit’s Germany director.</p>
<p>Should Mr Laschet and Ms Baerbock find themselves yoked in coalition after the election, as many expect, climate will be among the toughest elements of the negotiations. The new targets must be met, and the court satisfied. Postponing tricky conversations carries its own costs. </p>

<h1 id="The-EU-Made-in-America"><a href="#The-EU-Made-in-America" class="headerlink" title="The EU: Made in America"></a>The EU: Made in America</h1><p>America is an engine of European integration, intentionally or not</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>From the Big Mac to the nuclear bomb, the list of 20th-century America’s achievements is long. In a remarkable period of invention, America bestowed human flight, superglue, rock and roll, the Saturn V rocket, Pop Tarts and the internet upon humanity. One American innovation from this era receives much less attention: the European Union.</p>
<p>The eu is an American creation, as much as a European one. In the middle of the 20th century, there were more European federalists in Washington than in Brussels. Senators bashed out resolutions declaring: “Congress favours the creation of a United States of Europe.” The Marshall Plan, a torrent of post-war funding for the crippled continent, came on the condition that European countries meld themselves together. George Kennan, an American diplomat, summed up American policy: “We hoped to force the Europeans to think like Europeans, and not like nationalists.” Forget Jean Monnet. When it comes to naming founding fathers for the eu, the list should start with President Harry Truman.</p>
<p>When Joe Biden swung by Brussels on June 15th, he reiterated a long-standing American goal. In a festival of back-slapping, the president heaped compliments on the eu and stressed that an integrated club was in everyone’s interests. Donald Trump did his best to bury the thing, attacking it at every opportunity and loudly supporting Brexit. With Mr Trump gone, America has returned to its normal role of trying to make Europeans get along.</p>
<p>America has always been the secret ingredient of European integration. In the aftermath of the second world war, unifying Europe made sense for America. A divided continent could hardly resist Soviet domination. Nor would it be able to fix the “German problem” that had resulted in two wars in three decades. Instead, in a novel experiment by a victorious power, America opted to try to unite a traumatised continent, even though it could be a potential rival.</p>
<p>Skip forward 70 years and America is now a more subtle force for European unity. State-building can be a messy business, but American history provides one of the few guides for creating a continent-sized democracy. When discussing whether to issue collective debt, European politicians reach for Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s Founding Fathers. When wrestling over who has the final legal say, scholars look to the same debates that played out in 19th-century America. The eu is a unique beast, but American history still provides the best instruction manual for how to handle it.</p>
<p>Sometimes European integration is a byproduct of American policy. Stubbornly national elements of policymaking, such as corporation tax, are slowly being mangled into eu matters thanks to American action. A recent American-led push to set a global minimum tax rate for big business has done more to shunt the eu towards a common tax policy than years of nagging and legal tricks by Brussels. Within the eu, low-tax countries such as Ireland and Hungary wield a veto on its tax affairs. Diplomatic force majeure by America overcame that.</p>
<p>If American governments have been an engine of integration, then American companies have greased the gears. The rise of Netflix and other streaming services means that Europeans increasingly watch the same programmes, breaking national siloes. Facebook and Twitter allow for a raucous public sphere, where anyone can share thoughts on Emmanuel Macron. Google Translate makes users feel as if they had weirdly woken up with the ability to read 24 languages, allowing Italians to flick through newspapers in Swedish and Bulgarian, if they have the urge.</p>
<p>At times, America drove Europe closer together by mistake. When the American government tried to tear the club apart under Mr Trump, it ended up accidentally fortifying it. Mr Trump taught eu leaders that America would not always be a helpful ally and that the bloc had to stick up for itself. French diplomats were giddy, blowing the dust off old policy ideas for beefing up European power. In a post-Trump era, their fellow officials actually listened.</p>
<p>The eu still falls far short of the federal mini-me imagined by the likes of Marshall, Kennan and Truman. During the euro-zone crisis, American officials were left perplexed that Greece, an economy just over half the size of New Jersey, might blow up the project. When viewed from 4,000 miles away, the vicious disagreements in European politics that stood in the way of further integration seemed rather small. In this way, says Jeremy Shapiro at the European Council on Foreign Relations, America’s take on European integration resembles Gandhi’s view of Western civilisation: it would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Nowhere to run ain’t got nowhere to go<br>From an American perspective, a stronger eu is one that can be left alone. Europe was the front line of the cold war, but it is the periphery in America’s struggle with China. Europeans may not enjoy isolation. In the shade of America’s defence umbrella, difficult decisions could be avoided. It does not matter if, say, Poland or France has different security concerns, as long as America is happy to sit behind all of them. Exit America and these debates become awkward.</p>
<p>On paper, America wants a more capable eu. In practice, it may find such a development unsettling. At the turn of the century, the euro was talked of as a rival to the dollar. The euro’s near-collapse a decade later put paid to that idea. A stable euro zone with the ability to issue collective debt at will would be a much stronger potential challenger to the dollar’s supremacy. Where the eu does have power, such as over competition policy or privacy rules, it has delighted in whacking American firms. Such areas are rare but becoming less so. A more unified eu is a more powerful one and, almost inherently, a more independent one. America may, with time, come to regret what it has wrought.</p>

<h1 id="Britain-—Brexit-faces-problems-at-the-Northern-Irish-border"><a href="#Britain-—Brexit-faces-problems-at-the-Northern-Irish-border" class="headerlink" title="(Britain)—Brexit faces problems at the Northern Irish border"></a>(Britain)—Brexit faces problems at the Northern Irish border</h1><p>Britain’s uneasy relationship with the EU will get worse before it gets better</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>June 23rd marks the fifth anniversary of the Brexit referendum. Even the keenest Brexiteer must feel that the process has been tortuously long. That has been, in large part, because successive British governments have refused to accept the trade-off between untrammelled sovereignty and friction-free access to the eu’s single market, a refusal that shapes today’s increasingly testy relationship.</p>
<p>Almost six months after Britain finally left the single market, the impact on the economy is hard to unpick from that of covid-19. Yet the effects of new barriers to trade are clear. The Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University reckons that in the first quarter of 2021 British goods exports to the eu fell by 15%, while eu exports to Britain fell by 32%. The Office for National Statistics finds similarly that total eu-uk trade has shrunk by 20%. And a model constructed by John Springford of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank with offices in both London and Brussels, concludes that goods trade is 11% lower than it would otherwise have been, on top of an earlier 10% fall since the referendum.</p>
<p>Such numbers suggest that what was once dismissed as Project Fear is now Project Fact. A survey by consultants at ey found that 75% of firms had experienced business disruption from Brexit. Small firms found adjusting particularly hard because the eu-uk trade deal was struck just a week before exit, meaning there was no transition period. Services have been particularly hard hit. A study by researchers at Aston University concluded that, in the first four years after the referendum, British exports of services were more than £110bn ($155bn) lower than they would have been without the Brexit vote. And a report by New Financial, a London-based think-tank, found 440 financial-service firms that were moving part of their business and some staff, along with a shift of over £900bn of bank assets (10% of the total) to the eu.</p>
<p>The economy’s bounceback and Britain’s successful vaccine roll-out have disguised much of the impact. João Vale de Almeida, the eu’s ambassador to Britain, says the most immediate negative effects of Brexit are loss of mobility and damage to the union. Musicians and others in creative industries are complaining loudly about the first, and employers in hospitality also bemoan shortages of eu workers. As for the second, Brexit has clearly boosted the long-term chances of independence for Scotland, which voted strongly to remain in the eu. But the bigger worry is Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Accommodating its needs was always going to be devilishly difficult, because its border with Ireland is Britain’s only land border with the eu. All sides agree that a “hard” north-south border—one with physical infrastructure—could threaten the fragile peace. Theresa May’s failed answer was to avoid any border or customs checks with a “backstop” in the protocol that would have kept the entire uk in a customs union and the single market for goods until alternative arrangements were possible. But Mr Johnson came to power having pledged to get rid of the backstop by taking Great Britain out of the single market and the customs union, leaving Northern Ireland alone in both. And although he has often pretended otherwise, that made an east-west customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea unavoidable.</p>
<p>Just as inevitable were unionist objections. When supermarket supplies were disrupted straight after Brexit, loyalist youths took to the streets to protest. Unionist hardliners even claimed that, just as the decision to avoid a hard north-south border was motivated by fears of nationalist violence, so the threat of loyalist violence might now get rid of border controls in the Irish Sea. The new Democratic Unionist Party (dup) leader, Edwin Poots, calls for the protocol to be scrapped. Even if it stays, in 2024 the Northern Irish assembly could vote to end its application. A simple majority would suffice.</p>
<p>Arguments over implementation have been stirred by unilateral actions on both sides. The British government first proposed to breach international law in its internal-market bill last autumn, but dropped this plan when it struck a trade deal with the eu. In January the eu threatened to suspend the protocol unilaterally in a bid to stop vaccine exports from the bloc, though it backed down within hours. Mr Johnson has since broken the treaty by extending a grace period for the import of supermarket goods. Now he promises to do the same for the grace period for chilled-meat imports that expires at the end of June. The eu threatens to respond with not just legal action but tariffs, too, as permitted by the terms of the trade deal.</p>
<p>The prospect of a trade war over sausages may delight the pro-Brexit press, which is itching for a fight with the bully on the other side of the channel. It is unpopular, however, with Northern Irish businesses. And getting rid of the protocol would not be straightforward. The assembly election due within 12 months may see Sinn Fein, the main Irish-nationalist party, take the most seats, making it harder to win a majority in favour of removing the protocol. Katy Hayward of Queen’s University and uk in a Changing Europe, a think-tank, points out that voting to remove its trade clauses would merely trigger a negotiation to find some other option. And as Claire Hanna, a Social Democratic and Labour Party mp, observes, the dup has not suggested any alternative.</p>
<p>Aodhan Connolly of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium offers one possible solution. Instead of what he calls diplomacy by rival op-eds, he suggests a temporary commitment by the British government to stick with eu food-safety and veterinary standards. That would cut the number of border and customs checks required under the protocol by 80%, he says. The eu would be happy to agree to such a temporary measure, as would Mr Poots and the dup.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, however, is not keen on any alignment with eu regulations. This may seem odd, since he also insists he has no intention of weakening food-safety standards. Other neighbours of the eu, such as Norway and Switzerland, are happy to abide by its food rules in order to avert trade barriers. A more substantial objection is that such a policy would make it harder to negotiate a free-trade deal with America, which always demands better access for its farmers. But at the g7 summit in Cornwall between June 11th and 13th, President Joe Biden, anxious to avert renewed trouble in Northern Ireland or any risk of an intra-European trade war, promised that a trade deal would not be blocked by British alignment to eu food standards. And such a deal would, in any case, take years to negotiate.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to a pragmatic solution is lack of trust. The eu believes Mr Johnson signed the protocol intending not to stick to it. Mr Johnson thinks that some within the bloc want to drag Britain back into its regulatory orbit. Most worrying is that both sides have something to gain from playing tough: the eu by demonstrating that those who sign deals with it must stick to what they agreed; Mr Johnson by standing up to an overweening neighbour. Diplomats on both sides expect the relationship to worsen. Sadly, Northern Ireland may be the fall guy. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>In march 1987 Daniel Morgan, a private investigator, was found dead in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in south London. The axe used to kill him was embedded in his head. Its handle had been wrapped with sticking plasters, perhaps for a better grip, perhaps to avoid fingerprints. A wad of banknotes in his pocket was untouched.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police’s investigation of the crime was appalling. Its forensic work was lamentable even by the sloppy standards of the time. The investigation was marred by unseemly links between the police and Morgan’s associates, and between the police and tabloid newspapers. A detective sent to interview Morgan’s business partner, Jonathan Rees (who was later acquitted of the murder) omitted to mention that he knew him well, and that the three men had been drinking together the evening before Morgan was killed.</p>
<p>The most alarming possibility, which the panel can neither prove nor disprove, is that police officers were involved in the murder. Investigating officers heard that story, but discounted it partly because the man who related it had been charged with a crime. Morgan may have been about to reveal corruption in the Metropolitan Police to an officer from another force when he was killed.</p>
<p>All this is described in a long and detailed report released on June 15th by a panel chaired by Lady Nuala O’Loan, a veteran of police investigations in Northern Ireland. But the panel was concerned not only with Morgan’s murder (for which nobody has ever been convicted) and the investigation into it, but also corruption in the Metropolitan Police, both past and present.</p>
<p>That corruption was once serious and widespread in London’s main police force is indisputable. Officers with memories of the 1980s recalled envelopes filled with money and criminals paying for the right to operate. Ten officers connected to Morgan’s associates were later convicted of offences including bribery and supplying drugs. In 1997 the Metropolitan Police commissioner estimated that between one in 200 and one in 100 officers were corrupt.</p>
<p>It is much harder to argue that corruption still flourishes in the Met, given strenuous efforts to root it out since the 1990s. But the panel adopts a broad definition, arguing that failing “to be open and transparent” or “to admit past mistakes” is corruption if the intention is to protect an organisation’s reputation. It dubs these “institutional corruption” and says the force still suffers from this. Witness, for example, the Met’s tardiness in handing documents to the panel.</p>
<p>The conclusion deliberately echoes the Macpherson Report, which in 1999 dubbed the police institutionally racist. The police eventually accepted that charge. So far they are having no truck with the idea that they are institutionally corrupt as well.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>People believe many things, some sensible, some less so. English law regards it as a right to hold and express those beliefs—within reason. In recent years courts have ruled that beliefs in catastrophic climate change, ethical veganism and “the ability to communicate with spirits via mediums” are all “worthy of respect in a democratic society”. In 2019 a tribunal considered yet another, namely “that there are only two sexes…male and female”.</p>
<p>The plaintiff was Maya Forstater, a tax expert, who lost her job with an American think-tank for tweeting about her beliefs. She summarised them as that: “Women are adult human females. Men are adult human males,” and “sex cannot change”. Those beliefs were found “not worthy of respect in a democratic society” by an employment tribunal. On June 10th that ruling was overturned.</p>
<p>The decision matters, both for Ms Forstater and for Stonewall, a large campaigning charity. It says being trans—identifying as other than your natal sex—“isn’t about having (or not having) particular body parts”, but “something that’s absolutely core to a trans person’s identity and doesn’t alter—whatever outward appearances might be”. It describes any other view as “transphobia”.</p>
<p>Stonewall spreads this doctrine, widely known as “gender self-identification”, through its Diversity Champions scheme, which hundreds of big organisations, including nhs trusts, mi6, the army and the Home Office, are signed up to. The scheme’s business model is simple. Companies give Stonewall money; Stonewall checks that their policies align with its ideas and then badges them as diverse and inclusive. Simon Fanshawe, one of the charity’s founders and now a critic, thinks employers like it at least in part because “everybody’s so terrified that everybody got it so badly wrong with the gays that they’ve panicked about getting it wrong with the trans people”.</p>
<p>But the result has been inimical to freedoms of belief and speech at work. It is as though all major institutions decided that everyone had to be a practising Catholic, says Naomi Cunningham, an employment barrister and co-founder with Ms Forstater of Sex Matters, a campaign group. “And suddenly the rest of us have woken up and realised that we are in the grip of a theocracy [that] requires everybody to pay lip service.” Stonewall’s insistence that transness is not a physical matter, she suggests, echoes the Catholic belief in transubstantiation: a man may “retain the accidents of a man, but the essence is that of a woman”.</p>
<p>There are a few signs that faith in Stonewall may be starting to wane. In May the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an official body, said it was pulling out of the Diversity Champions scheme. Other big organisations are also leaving, and Liz Truss, the minister for women and equalities, says all government bodies should. In an article in the Times in May, Matthew Parris, another co-founder of Stonewall, said that “Stonewall has lost its way”. What was it doing, he asked, getting entangled in attempts to suppress free speech?</p>
<p>Mr Fanshawe thinks Stonewall’s travails are part of a wider malaise in political debate, namely a failure to engage civilly with opponents. The recent judgment, he points out, upheld not only Ms Forstater’s right to her beliefs, but also the right of others to believe in the primacy of gender identity over biological sex. True inclusion means, he says, “creating a very broad alliance”—not doing as Stonewall does, which he characterises as “sitting in a corner of a room with a bag over its head shouting ‘bigot’ at people”. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>The course of true love never did run smooth. That is particularly true when your lover weighs half a tonne and is wearing steel shoes. At the National Stud in Newmarket, a town in Suffolk widely regarded as the home of thoroughbred racing, it is breeding season. A mare stands in the shade of a stable. Her hooves have been covered with leather boots, to dampen kicks; her head is held by grooms. Tim Lane, director of the stud, calms her. The horses, brushed till they are as shiny as conkers—“they’ve got to look good,” explains Mr Lane—eye each other warily.</p>
<p>Thoroughbreds are the aristocrats of the horsing world: glamorous, subjected to odd mating rituals and more than a touch inbred. All are descended from three Arabian stallions brought to England in around 1700; animals which, Charles Darwin said, had “the commingled blood of Arabs, Turks and Barbs” in their veins. They make the Habsburgs look genetically diverse.</p>
<p>Always closely related, thoroughbreds are getting even more so. A recent study published in Scientific Reports found “a highly significant increase in inbreeding in the global thoroughbred population during the last five decades”. All but 3% of the 10,000 horses in the study counted Northern Dancer, born in 1961, among their ancestors. Superstar sires “cover”, as horsey types call mating, over 200 mares per year, up from 40 in Northern Dancer’s day.</p>
<p>At first, horse breeders did not consider inbreeding a problem. On the contrary: horses, like maidens, were better when purer. Within a century of the arrival of those three stallions, it was decided that the job of perfecting the horse had been done so well that the stud book was closed to new entrants. Aristocrats policed the parentage of their horses, listing their dams and sires in Weatherbys stud book. In 1826 Burke’s Peerage appeared, allowing aristocrats to do much the same for themselves. Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, recommended that “no time ought to be lost” in instituting a human equivalent to the stud book, to record not class, but fitness and form.</p>
<p>Eugenics has fallen out of fashion. The horsey equivalent has not. Thoroughbreds can earn far more from propagating their race than from running races. At the National Stud, one commands a fee of £25,000 ($35,000) for a cover. Galileo, among the world’s finest stallions, is rumoured to command £600,000 a pop.</p>
<p>Such fees make the very best thoroughbred semen one of the world’s most expensive substances, at around £6m a litre. Precise sums are difficult as it is not sold by the bottle (horses conceived by artificial insemination cannot be registered as thoroughbreds) and quantities naturally vary, but there is no doubt this is a profitable business. The finest stallions can earn a million pounds in a day.</p>
<p>Fashionable sires are therefore good for breeders. But they may be bad for the breed. As genetic mutations accumulate, health and fertility decline. Such problems have been found in species as diverse as dogs, humans and cows, and it is hard to see why horses would be immune to them. “We don’t know yet how much inbreeding is tolerable or whether we’ve reached a tipping point, or when that point might be reached,” says Emmeline Hill of University College Dublin, one of the authors of the recent report. Genetic problems may be accumulating, unseen.</p>
<p>Back at the National Stud the gleaming horses, cover completed, trot back into the sunlight. Mr Lane, like Ms Hill, considers that what matters is not just appearance, but function. A horse that looks wonderful might not race well, or breed well. Teasingly, he reaches for an analogy with another species. “Not all good-looking women can cook, can they?” </p>

<h1 id="The-British-covid-19-warning"><a href="#The-British-covid-19-warning" class="headerlink" title="The British covid-19 warning"></a>The British covid-19 warning</h1><p>Despite rapid vaccination, rising case numbers force Boris Johnson to delay reopening</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>At first the government focused support—surge vaccination, wastewater testing and the like—where the covid-19 Delta variant (then known as B.1.617.2) had taken hold. Now, it is everywhere, accounting for 90% of cases, and so the support has spread, too; from Bolton and south London to Birmingham, Blackpool, Cheshire, Chester, Liverpool and Warrington. The battle to defeat the variant has been lost. The aim now is to stop cases spiralling.</p>
<p>Ministers and modellers hold little hope that these measures, and a vaccination campaign that has jabbed more than six in ten Britons, will protect hospitals. So on June 14th Boris Johnson announced that “stage 4” of the reopening, allowing big events and indoor gatherings of more than six people, would be delayed from June 21st to July 19th. The government is also thinking about the long haul, including how to improve public ventilation and whether to encourage people back into offices.</p>
<p>The postponement reflects both bad luck and bad policy. According to Public Health England (phe), the Delta variant is around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha (formerly Kent) variant, which is in turn more transmissible than earlier ones. The new wave is spreading among younger Britons, who are more likely to be unvaccinated or to have received only a single dose, which another phe study finds is a third less effective at preventing infection by the Delta variant than by the Alpha one. The extra delay before easing restrictions will mean more second jabs, which are just as good at preventing hospitalisation.</p>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, has said the roll-out would have been faster had the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (jcvi) not recommended, in response to rare blood clots, that under-40s be offered jabs other than AstraZeneca. This raises two questions. Was the advice followed correctly? The jcvi recommended other jabs only if it would not “substantially delay” vaccination. And will that advice change? No case-count threshold has been set for reversing it, but the committee is keeping an eye on the risk-benefit calculation as cases rise.</p>
<p>Britain is still better placed than most of the rich world to weather the new variant (see chart). “Countries that have taken a more lackadaisical approach will find themselves with a big problem,” predicts Sir John Bell of the University of Oxford. That there are so many Delta cases probably reflects the fact that lots of people infected with it reached Britain early, he says. Mr Johnson’s delay in adding India to the “red list” of countries, with tighter travel restrictions, looks foolish. That vaccines mean the mistake is likely to prove less deadly than previous ones will be little comfort to businesses desperate to reopen, or to hedonists desperate to party. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Gary sullivan is the chairman of Wilson James, a security and logistics company. But when covid-19 ravaged Britain last year he shed his suit, donned a uniform and helped build a hospital at a convention centre in east London. For in addition to his day job, Mr Sullivan is also the commanding officer of the British Army’s Engineer and Logistic Staff Corps, a group of senior executives who volunteer their time to the armed forces. His straddling of civilian and military worlds might be a model for the future.</p>
<p>Last month the government published an independent review of military reservists conducted by Mark Lancaster, a Conservative peer and former minister for the armed forces. His recommendations, he says, would constitute the “biggest shake-up of reserves since 1914”.</p>
<p>Britain’s Army Reserve has existed in one form or another for over a century. As the Territorial Army, the name used until 2014, its reputation was that of enthusiastic amateurs playing soldiers at the weekends. Reserves were warm bodies used to bulk out an army that had shrunk dramatically after the cold war, training sporadically but to be used only in extremis. In recent years the reserve developed a more “professional ethos”, says Patrick Bury of the University of Bath, shedding its old (and unfair) reputation as a “drinking club”. Reserves made up 15% of the deployed force in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Now, the idea is that they should play a larger and more routine role in military activity. One spur for change has been the pandemic, during which the armed forces have driven oxygen tankers, built hospitals and delivered vaccines, most recently to combat local outbreaks in the north of England. That response was possible only because reservists brought skills from the civilian world. Mr Sullivan’s staff corps also responded to Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean in 2017, the collapse of a dam at Toddbrook reservoir in the Peak District in 2019 and last summer’s explosion in Beirut.</p>
<p>Mobilising civilian expertise is nothing new. The staff corps was formed in 1865, to ensure privately owned railways would serve the state in wartime. Military doctors have long worked in the National Health Service to keep their skills sharp. But the renewed emphasis on reservists also follows from a broader shift in the nature of warfare: away from manpower and towards technology and information. During the cold war the cutting edge of technology lay in defence laboratories. Now many advanced military capabilities—cyber-security, space, artificial intelligence and robotics—lie largely in the private sector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a growing emphasis on propaganda and battles of narrative lends itself to skills found in creative industries. “If you want a good television cameraperson for countering Russian media operations, you’re better off recruiting somebody from the bbc to be a reservist than trying to bring them into the army and then expecting them to maintain their skills level,” says Paul O’Neill, a former head of “people strategy” at the defence ministry and now at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank.</p>
<p>That is precisely what 77 Brigade has done. The army’s specialist unit for information operations—in large part, psychological warfare—it has more reservists than regulars. They include journalists, psychologists and executives at social-media firms. Many have the opportunity to use skills such as hacking in a way that would otherwise be illegal.</p>
<p>Attracting such talent will require greater flexibility than is usual in armed forces. Already cyber reserves, who contribute to the new offensive National Cyber Force, need not satisfy the same age and fitness standards that bind other reservists. Mr Sullivan’s terms of service allow him to keep a beard. Lord Lancaster’s own reserve career involves working two days a week as a brigadier at Britain’s Strategic Command, which co-ordinates cyber and special forces, among other cross-service capabilities. Such part-time involvement currently requires special permission, but the armed-forces bill introduced in May would put it on a regular footing. “Being a reservist fits with the gig economy,” notes Mr Sullivan. “More and more people now have portfolio careers.”</p>
<p>Also being considered is allowing experienced civilians to enter at higher ranks, rather than working their way up. The rank system itself might need to adapt, too. Mr O’Neill gives the example of a hypothetical barrister who wants to “run around Salisbury Plain as an infantry soldier”. He or she might be recruited as a junior officer, vaulted to lieutenant-colonel when the army needs legal expertise and dropped back when the need has passed.</p>
<p>That still leaves bigger questions about the reserves’ raison d’être. Regular forces are now very lean by historical standards, and would need augmenting in time of major war. But using reserves for this purpose would be tricky. Ben Barry of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, another think-tank, who once commanded a reserve-heavy brigade in Bosnia, points out that whereas the army reserve is a microcosm of the regular force—a little of everything—the navy and air-force equivalents focus on niche capabilities. They could not be called up as complete squadrons like America’s Air National Guard.</p>
<p>Raw numbers are also an issue, however. In March, as part of a radical defence review, the government said the regular army would shrink to 72,500 soldiers, its smallest in centuries. Lord Lancaster’s review envisions not just reservists who are more actively engaged, but alongside them a “largely dormant” pool of ex-regulars, who could provide “surge capacity” in a crisis. Yet the government has given no sign that reserves will grow. Patriotic hackers and bored lawyers will not be enough to make up the numbers. </p>

Snow’s two-cultures divide</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Few lectures have had as much impact as C.P. Snow’s on “two cultures”, delivered in Cambridge in 1959. Its thesis was that Western intellectual life was divided into two mutually uncomprehending camps—the sciences and the arts—with arts graduates disdainful of culturally illiterate scientists, and scientists astonished that arts graduates had no clue about the second law of thermodynamics. (Snow, as both a chemist and a novelist, had a foot in both camps.) It provoked a vituperative response from F.R. Leavis, an English-literature don, who described his Cambridge colleagues as being “intellectually as undistinguished as it is possible to be”, but was largely greeted with rousing applause as an intellectual landmark and a call to action.</p>
<p>This columnist was reminded of the two cultures by recent goings-on in Oxford, Cambridge’s perennial rival. On June 12th a striking number of Oxford scientists were recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list for their role in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Among those honoured were Sarah Gilbert and Adrian Hill, who were instrumental in developing the AstraZeneca vaccine; and Peter Horby and Martin Landray, who co-led the world’s largest randomised tests of treatments. The awards recognised Oxford’s commitment to scientific excellence, as well as the dedication of extraordinary individuals.</p>
<p>Days earlier 150 Oxford dons had published an open letter announcing a boycott of Oriel College. They would refuse to teach its students, attend its seminars or help with outreach to applicants, in protest against its decision not to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes that faces the High Street. What to do with the statue is complicated by Rhodes’s dual career as a committed imperialist and great university benefactor. (It is also ugly.) But a boycott is silly. It punishes Oriel’s students and potential students, who have no say over the statue’s fate. It offends against college self-governance. After agonising over the statue for years, Oriel has opted for a policy of “retain and explain”, in part because changing the façade of a Grade Two listed building would be pricey, and the college is already burdened with pandemic-related expenses.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by many of Oxford’s noisiest public and would-be public intellectuals. One is Danny Dorling, a professor of geography and the author of “Slowdown”, which argues that tepid economic and demographic growth are “good for the economy, the planet and our lives”. We need to stop treating “change, innovation and discovery as unalloyed benefits”, he argues, and welcome slowdown as salvation from “disaster far worse than a pandemic”. Another is Dan Hicks, curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum, author of “The Brutish Museums” and a leading campaigner for the return of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. He argues that Western museums “house unending violence, ceaseless trauma, colonial crimes committed again every morning as the strip lights click on”. The only alternative he sees to complicity in imperial bloodshed and genocide is to return “the curated spoils of empire” as part of a broader process of “decolonisation”. The younger researchers who added their names to the letter are well represented by Sneha Krishnan, a “feminist historical and cultural geographer” who is studying “how childhood and youth are materialised in entanglement with the enduring power of imperialism”.</p>
<p>The contrast between the honorands and the letter-writers points to the existence of two cultures in the modern university, and indeed the modern intellectual world: one of optimistic problem-solving and another of pessimistic problem-wallowing. The honorands, confronted by a global pandemic, set about fighting it with every weapon to hand. The signatories are fixated on battles about cultural symbols. The honorands are inventing the future; the signatories are preoccupied with purging the sins of the past. The honorands represent a new-found commitment to commercialising university research, particularly in the life sciences and medicine, and thereby powering the country’s economy. The letter-writers represent the latest example of the ancient academic habit of contemplating one’s own navel.</p>
<p>It is easy to dismiss such broad-brush generalisations with Leavisite disdain. Isn’t the division between problem-solvers and problem-wallowers just another way of describing C.P. Snow’s division between scientists and artists? There is a limit to how much you can improve the world by writing another commentary on Chaucer. And isn’t the real problem with the letter-writers, and those who think like them, not that they are energy-sapping but that they are irrelevant—fighting about the past because they have no purchase on the future?</p>
<p>Makers and takers<br>The first objection has merit, but only up to a point. Though it is certainly easier for scientists to invent the future, plenty of scientists are addicted to negativity and plenty of arts graduates relish a challenge. Some within the Royal Society, Britain’s premier scientific institution, are notably reluctant to seize the opportunities provided by the twin hammer blows of Brexit and covid-19 to help convert Britain’s scientific talent into innovation. The second objection is, sadly, wide of the mark. There are good reasons for acknowledging the sins of the past, particularly if they are celebrated by statues that offend ethnic minorities. But it is ahistorical and anti-intellectual to ignore context and pretend that no other cultures have ever sinned in matters of slavery and imperialism.</p>
<p>For worryingly many intellectuals, this obsession with the past crimes of Western countries is part of a bigger project of deconstructing Western power. This means tearing down structures that, supposedly, continue to oppress everybody other than heterosexual white males. It also means damning capitalism as inherently racist and colonialist. The slowdown that would inevitably follow any such deconstruction would leave Oxford fellows standing, but flatten ordinary Britons.</p>

<p>Winnie muhonja has faced many difficulties in her life. Covid-19 is just the latest. Having grown up in Kibera, a huge slum with 300,000 residents in the middle of Nairobi, she is used to the presence of disease and the absence of money. Ms Muhonja, who is 25, has lived with her sister since she left school eight years ago. She has two jobs but cannot afford 1,000 shillings ($9.30) a month to rent a mud house for herself and her one-year-old son. “I just hope one day I’ll get a chance to get out of Kibera,” Ms Muhonja says.</p>
<p>Almost 4,000 miles away in Madrid, another young woman longs to escape her neighbourhood. In Cañada Real, a shantytown of about 8,000, Douaa Akrikez is in her final year of school and studying hard. Life in Europe’s biggest slum is not nearly as grim as it is in Kibera but it is still precarious. Electricity outages this winter left at least 4,500 people there without heat for months, at a time when Spain was hit by record snowfalls. Without light and unable to charge laptops or mobile phones, children struggled with online learning. “I want to finish my studies, start working and get out of here,” says the 17-year-old.</p>
<p>With so many other problems in their lives, neither Ms Muhonja nor Ms Akrikez has much time to fret about covid-19. But the pandemic means policymakers are concerned about them. Around the world over a billion people live in slums, in rickety homes without property rights or basic services such as running water or reliable electricity. Most of the world’s worst-off slum-dwellers are in poor countries but shantytowns exist in rich ones too. Those who live in them tend to have informal jobs: hawking snacks, for example, or cleaning richer people’s houses. In rich countries, this means they miss out on government support such as furlough schemes. In poor countries, they get little support of any kind. In Nairobi, curfews have been imposed to slow the spread of covid-19. Those who have broken them in their efforts to make enough money to survive have been beaten up by the police.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, policymakers worried most about poverty outside cities (see chart). Rural places often lack basic infrastructure such as roads and internet connections. But with an airborne virus in circulation, the risk of working outside tending livestock or ploughing fields is lower than cleaning houses. And even when no money is coming in, subsistence farming keeps stomachs full.</p>
<p>It is hard-up folks in cities who have been hardest hit by covid-19, both economically and in terms of their health. In May over a third of respondents in Kenyan cities told the World Bank that they had skipped at least one meal in the previous week, compared with 27% of those in the countryside. Among city-dwellers 15% said they were unemployed, almost certainly representing a bigger shock to urban areas. By the end of this year the bank predicts the pandemic will have pushed 150m more people into extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. The new poor are more likely to be in metropolises than previously.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has forced city authorities to acknowledge slums, both for the sake of their inhabitants and their neighbours. The disease spreads fast when people live at close quarters. One study of Mumbai between June and July last year, before India’s second wave hit, found 54% of the city’s slum-dwellers had covid-19 antibodies, compared with 16% of those in formal settlements. That quickly spills into other neighbourhoods. Students from Cañada Real pile into buses to get to schools in and around the capital. Kibera is nestled between posh residential areas of Nairobi, where many slum-dwellers work.</p>
<p>Development wonks tend to focus on poor people in poor cities, such as Ms Muhonja, rather than poor people in rich cities, such as Ms Akrikez. That makes sense. The former are much poorer. Kibera is the sort of slum depicted in fundraising letters from charities: huts made of mud and sheets of corrugated iron; rubbish heaped on unpaved streets.</p>
<p>Extreme poverty makes it harder to stay healthy. Ms Muhonja shares her one-room shack with five other people. Social distancing is all but impossible. They have no running water. Instead they buy jerry cans of water for drinking and cooking and pay to use communal baths.</p>
<p>Residents of Kibera complain less about the risks of covid-19 to their health and more about its economic impact. When the hair salon where she works cut Ms Muhonja’s hours, a friend hired her to look after his mobile-money stall. But the 6,000 shillings a month she earns there is not enough. And she is one of the lucky ones. Many of her neighbours are jobless. Many residents rent their homes from private landlords. These landlords threaten tenants, removing doors and roofs as penalty for non-payment, according to Joe Muturi of Slum Dwellers International, a network of community groups. “The threat of eviction is always there,” he says.</p>
<p>People in Cañada Real are far better off. Many do not pay rent. The settlement sits on public land that was once an ancient drove-road for sheep. The residents include Roma (gypsy) families, poor Spaniards and north African migrants, many of whom worked in the construction industry before the global financial crisis of 2008. As a result parts of the slum look like any other neighbourhood in Spain’s capital, with solid roads lined with neat concrete houses. Only the tangle of wires on top of electricity posts gives away that this is an informal shantytown.</p>
<p>Ms Akrikez lives with her parents and four siblings in a sturdy house with clean water and flushing toilets in Cañada Real. Her father makes a steady living on building sites. They can afford to buy face-masks and new clothes.</p>
<p>The thief of joy<br>But people in Cañada Real are poor compared with those around them. Relative poverty (ie, how poor people’s incomes compare with the national median) is painful. The stigma is worse. Most people Ms Muhonja knows struggle just like her to get enough food, a roof and clean water.</p>
<p>Ms Akrikez, by contrast, only recently told her classmates where she lives. She had to build up the courage. Many think the residents of Cañada Real are “different”, “delinquents” and “people who don’t work”, she says. That humiliation, says Sabina Alkire, director of the Poverty and Human Development Initiative at Oxford University, can affect the brain in the same way as physical pain. “People feel excluded and it hurts,” she continues. Ms Akrikez goes to school outside Cañada Real. Her friends hang out in the city centre at the weekend. She has no way of getting there. Her only outings are organised by Caritas, a Catholic charity. “It’s not a normal life,” she says.</p>
<p>When most Madrileños think of Cañada Real they imagine not diligent teenagers but drugs. One area, Sector Six, is a hub in Europe’s drug trade. At a local church charities hand out food, water and clean needles. “This is the back door of Madrid where people put their trash and don’t even look at it,” says María de las Mercedes González Fernández, the central government’s top official for Madrid and a member of the Socialist Party, who blames the right-wing municipal government for failing to help.</p>
<p>The authorities responsible for Cañada Real have long known how difficult life there is. They signed a pact four years ago pledging to move families from the worst-off parts and upgrade the rest. But progress has been sluggish. Ms Akrikez knows of just one family that has been rehoused.</p>
<p>Reliable utilities and clear property rights are a long way off in shantytowns everywhere. In places such as Cañada Real, where relative poverty is the problem, there is no quick fix. Some residents have formal ids and receive handouts from the government. But social exclusion persists.</p>
<p>Shifting up a gear<br>In some of the world’s poorest countries, where the problem is extreme poverty, the pandemic is prompting governments to action. Some governments are extending social-protection programmes, like cash transfers, to urban areas. It is not easy. Local authorities do not have complete lists of who lives where or details of their earnings. Few slum-dwellers have the necessary paperwork. But in recent months the Democratic Republic of Congo has used satellite imagery to identify the poorest neighbourhoods by housing density and flood risk to help target its emergency cash-transfer programme. Togo’s government has signed up a third of its adult population, 1.6m people, to a new social-assistance programme using radio, television and social media to spread the word. Now it must find more money for them.</p>
<p>Even such minor successes are all too rare. Covid-19 has turned a spotlight on slums, but most governments are still failing their inhabitants. As they did before the pandemic, charities are trying to plug the gap. People in Kibera joke that there is one for every household in the area. They have set up handwashing facilities and education campaigns during the pandemic. But volunteers can only do so much. Overcrowded, unregulated settlements risk becoming a Petri dish for new variants of covid-19. So far, even that threat has not spurred governments to do much. </p>

<h1 id="Technology-Quarterly-—Loss-of-biodiversity-poses-as-great-a-risk-to-humanity-as-climate-change"><a href="#Technology-Quarterly-—Loss-of-biodiversity-poses-as-great-a-risk-to-humanity-as-climate-change" class="headerlink" title="(Technology Quarterly)—Loss of biodiversity poses as great a risk to humanity as climate change"></a>(Technology Quarterly)—Loss of biodiversity poses as great a risk to humanity as climate change</h1><p>Technology has a growing role to play in monitoring, modelling and protecting ecosystems, writes Catherine Brahic</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Human societies depend on healthy ecosystems. People consume their products in the shape of fish, meat, crops, timber and fibres such as cotton and silk. Medicines may be directly harvested from the natural world or inspired by molecules and mechanisms found within it. The ecosystems that crops depend upon are regulated by living things. Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants take in carbon and pump out oxygen. In doing so they remove roughly 11bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, equivalent to 27% of what human industry and agriculture emits (the oceans absorb a further 10bn tonnes).</p>
<p>The services that ecosystems provide to humanity depend, in turn, on there being a diversity of living things. More than 75% of global food-crop types, including coffee, cocoa and almonds, are pollinated by animals. The complex web underpinning every food chain and ecosystem means that the narrow range of species that humans eat and exploit cannot be sustained without the existence of a much greater diversity of animals, plants and bacteria.</p>
<p>More diverse forests store more carbon than monocultures. Skipjack tuna makes up roughly half of the global tuna catch for human consumption. As young animals, they eat zooplankton, which is to say very small floating animals like tunicates, ctenophores and small crustaceans as well as the larvae of larger animals. As adults, they eat smaller fish, squid and crustaceans. To conserve the skipjack, all this diversity in its food chain must also be conserved.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, alarmed by studies showing rapid declines in animal and plant species around the globe, ecologists have talked of an impending mass extinction. It would be the sixth in the Earth’s history, but one unlike any that has come before. Surveys show that the loss of biodiversity is the result of a combination of factors: climate change, pollution, human exploitation of land, sea, plants and animals, and the displacement of some species into new territories where they play havoc with existing ecosystems. Uniquely in Earth’s history, each of these drivers of ecological change is caused by a single species: Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>When ipbes (the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) published its assessment of the state of global biodiversity in 2019, it offered a sobering picture. Roughly 1m animal and plant species were deemed to be at risk of extinction, more than at any other point in human history. These included many that are used in farming. At least 9% of the 6,200 breeds of domesticated mammals that humans eat, or use to produce food, had become extinct by 2016, and at least 1,000 more are threatened. More than one-third of continental land area and nearly three-quarters of freshwater resources are used to produce crops or livestock, but environmental degradation has damaged the land’s ability to support these activities. And one-third of marine fish stocks were being unsustainably exploited in 2015.</p>
<p>The biodiversity crisis poses as great a risk to human societies as climate change. Yet it has a fraction of the public profile. In part that is because the loss of biodiversity cannot be neatly quantified, as climate change can, into parts per million of carbon dioxide, or degrees above pre-industrial average temperatures. And the webs that link species within and across ecosystems are even more complex than the processes that drive climate change.</p>
<p>Understanding a problem, however, is a necessary step towards solving it. And that is where technology can help. This Technology Quarterly will consider its role in monitoring, preserving and restoring ecosystems and species. Only by measuring the state of ecosystems can their health be assessed, losses be quantified, and the effectiveness of interventions be evaluated.</p>
<p>As well as monitoring biodiversity, technology can also be deployed to protect it. And in some cases it may even be able to reverse losses, by bringing extinct species back from the dead. Ironically, it is humanity’s use of technology, whether in simple forms such as chainsaws or dragnets, or more complex ones such as modern agriculture and transportation, that is chiefly responsible for biodiversity loss. The challenge now is to deploy it so that it is not just part of the problem, but part of the solution. </p>

<p>The new forest cicada had not been seen in seven years when it caught the attention of Alex Rogers, an ecologist and computer scientist at the University of Oxford. The insect is the only cicada native to the British Isles. It spends 7-8 years underground as a nymph, then emerges, reproduces and dies within six weeks. During its short adult life, it produces a high-pitched hiss that would make it easier to detect, were it not at the upper limit of human hearing. Its call is audible to children but not to most adults. It can, however, be picked up by smartphone microphones. This led to the invention of AudioMoth, an “acoustic logger” that can be set to listen for a particular sound and record it.</p>
<p>The device takes its name from the fact that moths can hear sounds across a wide frequency spectrum. It is roughly 60mm square and 15mm thick and includes a smartphone microphone, a memory card and a basic processing chip, powered by three aa batteries. Dr Rogers’s startup, Open Acoustic Devices, sells them for $60 through a group-purchasing scheme which helps keep costs low. At that price, “you can deploy many more devices, you can post them out to people and if they get lost or stolen, it doesn’t really matter,” says Dr Rogers. To date, some 30,000 AudioMoths have been scattered around the globe. A smaller version has just been launched and is being incorporated into an experiment to study how African carnivores are responding to warmer temperatures by monitoring the sounds they make, such as panting.</p>
<p>The AudioMoth is just one example of the explosion in the use of sensors to monitor ecosystems that has occurred in the past decade. Such devices are peppered across forests and national parks, attached to trees or the backs of animals. As well as recording environmental data, such as temperature or humidity, they also monitor the nature, number and movement of living things.</p>
<p>Motion-activated camera traps have captured images of the shyest snow leopards. Microphones monitor bat colonies, known to harbour diseases that can jump to humans, and coral reefs, whose crackling sounds are thought to broadcast their location to nearby fish. Radio tags attached to animals capture data about their behaviour as they go about their daily lives. The Icarus project has around 5,000 lightweight tags, weighing just five grams each, attached to animals on all continents. The sensors track the animals’ movements to within a few metres, along with the local temperature, pressure and humidity—all of which is relayed back to researchers via an antenna on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Technologies borrowed from the smartphone industry, including batteries, cameras, microphones and chips, have helped make such sensors smaller, cheaper and more capable. Before the Icarus project developed its five-gram sensors, most radio tags weighed 15-20g. A future version will reduce the weight to just one gram, allowing the tags to be attached to even smaller creatures. Smartphone technology has also reduced the cost and size of camera traps. TrailGuard, a device developed by Resolve, an American environmental group, houses a tiny camera in a package the size of a Sharpie pen, which is hard to spot once it has been hung in a tree.</p>
<p>Another hot technology, machine learning, has revolutionised the task of scanning through the resulting sound recordings, images and other readings, many of which are false alarms. Working with researchers in artificial intelligence, conservationists can rely on algorithms to do the recognising for them. Big tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, are also getting involved. Wildlife Insights, a collaboration of seven large conservation organisations, with support from Google, is trying to create a single space where all camera traps will log their data (its database currently counts 16,652 camera-trap projects in 44 countries). Its machine-learning models can filter out the blank images that make up the majority of camera-trap pictures and identify hundreds of species in the remaining ones. Wild Me, an ngo based in Oregon, has algorithms for 53 species, capable of distinguishing between individual animals based on their stripes, spots or wrinkles.</p>
<p>As sensors get smarter, they are increasingly able to process data themselves—at the network edge, rather than centrally in the cloud—which reduces the need to transmit or store data unnecessarily. If sensors are networked, they can also raise the alarm right away if they spot something important. TrailGuard is different from most camera traps in that it is built to identify poachers, rather than wildlife. During its demonstration phase, it was installed in one of Africa’s largest wildlife parks, and detected two humans as they entered the area. Within a minute, images had been sent to the park’s headquarters, where staff confirmed that they showed two poachers, who were later arrested. Relaying data back to researchers can be tricky, however, as wildlife surveys are often carried out in remote areas with little or no mobile-network coverage. Sending data via satellite works well, but is expensive—though prices may fall as new constellations in low-Earth orbit become available.</p>
<p>Putting devices on the ground, or attached to animals, is not the only way to monitor ecosystems. It can also be done from the air or from space. Regional, and even global, snapshots can be generated using instruments mounted on planes or by scanning the Earth using satellites. The dozens of Earth-observation instruments orbiting the planet can collect information about land use, detect blooms in oceanic plankton, monitor emissions from forest fires, and track oil spills or the break-up of polar ice sheets. Remote sensing has long been used by environmental groups keen to monitor deforestation rates in remote regions.</p>
<p>But satellite imagery can be flawed. Viewed from above, some tropical tree plantations can look like native forest. And although spotting large areas that have been clear-cut is simple, identifying regions where selective logging, clearing of underbrush or overhunting of seed-dispersing animals is degrading the integrity of a forest is much more difficult. A study published in Nature in 2020 found that only 40% of remaining forests have high integrity; the remaining 60% have been degraded in some way. In 2019, an international team of ecologists and forestry experts showed that taking into account the degradation of seemingly intact forests increased estimates of forestry emissions six-fold, compared with just looking at emissions caused by clear-cutting. This research relied on a combination of remote-ensing data with numerical modelling and on-the-ground fieldwork.</p>
<p>Eyes in the sky<br>New tools to assess forests’ health are becoming available, the most important of which is lidar—a technique which is similar to radar except that it employs infrared laser light instead of radio waves, and can map out spaces in high resolution and in three dimensions. Pointed at a tree, it can generate a 3 d model of its entire structure, including the position of every branch to within a millimetre. Such data can be used to estimate the volume and mass of a tree, or an area of forest, and hence its carbon content.</p>
<p>The Global Airborne Observatory takes this kind of 3d modelling one step further. The brainchild of Greg Asner of Arizona State University, it combines lidar with spectrometers and cameras mounted on a plane. Two high-powered laser beams fired out from beneath the plane sweep over the landscape, creating a detailed 3d model of everything underneath, from the treetops to the ground. At the same time, the spectrometers bounce light of various wavelengths off the foliage. Using a reference library containing thousands of dried and frozen plant samples, the team has worked out how to identify individual plant species from the spectroscopic data and determine their moisture content. The result is a detailed picture of the landscape showing the shape, size and species of individual trees, from which the carbon content and overall health of the forest can be determined.</p>
<p>In May 2021, Dr Asner and his team launched a related tool focused on the oceans. Coral bleaching, caused by warmer seas, damages reefs. Thousands of associated species, from sponges to octopuses, depend on the health of their home reef. The Allen Coral Atlas uses high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor bleaching events in real time by detecting changes in the reflectivity of reefs. A trial run, in Hawaii in 2019, identified bleaching that field surveys had missed. The hope is that by detecting it as it occurs, other causes of stress such as fishing can be reduced, giving reefs a better chance of recovery. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>In september and October 2000, the carcasses of several northern hairy-nosed wombats and some fragments of intestine were discovered in Australia’s Epping Forest National Park, apparently left behind by a mystery predator. Cattle farming has shrunk the wombats’ natural habitat and consequently their population, which reached a low of just 20-30 animals in the 1970s before land-management policies helped push numbers back up to roughly 100 in the early 2000s. By sequencing dna extracted from the Epping Forest remains, researchers identified six males and one female. But what had slain 6% of the known wombat population?</p>
<p>Suspicion fell on either dingoes or wild dogs, and the final answer came packaged inside faeces collected in the park. Some yielded the same genetic sequences as the carcasses. They had been left by dingoes. The team had identified their killers, and in 2002 a 20km protective fence was put up around the forest.</p>
<p>Environmental dna, or edna, has emerged as an increasingly popular tool among conservation biologists and land managers, as dna-sequencing tools have become progressively smaller, faster and cheaper. The field began in the late 1980s, when microbiologists started using it to look for bacteria in rivers and sediment. This had previously involved smearing water or dirt on Petri dishes to grow colonies of the resident microbes and then identifying them under the microscope, based on the shape of the colonies or how they responded to being stained with dye. It was lengthy and error-prone. Extracting dna from samples instead, and comparing their genetic sequence to reference libraries, was quicker and more reliable.</p>
<p>The same approach was adopted and built upon in the early 2000s by ecologists, who were aware that the animals they studied were constantly shedding dna in faeces, saliva, blood, scales and sloughed tissue. Gathering and sequencing this material provided valuable information without needing to interact with the animals themselves. The approach found particular favour early on with researchers studying freshwater systems. By simply dipping a test tube into a stream, they could find out if a target species was present and even how abundant it was.</p>
<p>Because trace amounts of dna can be amplified before sequencing using a method called polymerase chain reaction (pcr, the same method used to detect sars-cov-2 in coronavirus testing), edna studies can detect species present in low numbers—a useful tool for tracking down rare species, or spotting invasive ones before they wreak havoc on a fishery. Other studies have sought evidence that escapees from fish farms were mating with wild populations, potentially eroding them.</p>
<p>dna from scat, as wild animal droppings are known, can map out food chains without having to capture and kill animals in order to examine the contents of their guts. Killing large or rare species like whales, even for conservation purposes, poses ethical and practical challenges. But whale scat has the great advantage of buoyancy. Finding a turd floating in the middle of the ocean is made easier with the help of dogs that are trained to sniff out the signature smells of excrement belonging to a range of endangered species. dna in the netted excrement can be analysed to determine what the animal ate, or what bacteria live in its gut.</p>
<p>On land, researchers can use edna from faeces, urine or hair to see how populations are interacting. In Malaysia, an ongoing project is focused on whether sub-populations of the Malayan tiger are still connected when deforestation has fragmented their habitat. In Britain edna is used to monitor a protected newt. Other projects have begun to show that cells left in footprints in snow can yield enough dna to identify species and possibly sex.</p>
<p>Several groups are attempting to identify all the individuals belonging to a population from footprint dna, which would transform monitoring of populations, help with the tracking of animals as they roam across wide areas without the need for radiotags, and setting sustainable hunting quotas. Researchers at the us Forest Service are trying this with wolves.</p>
<p>So-called “metagenomic” studies use e dna to map the genetic make-up of entire communities, such as coral reefs, or the vast, largely unexplored bacterial community that lives deep inside the Earth’s crust and whose biomass is an order of magnitude greater than that of all animals combined. Such studies can offer a genetic snapshot that might take years of field studies to establish.</p>
<p>The field is booming, but there are challenges. It can be difficult to tell when edna was deposited. dna sampled at one point in a river could have come from anywhere upstream. And species identification is only as good as the species-specific genetic barcodes and reference genomes that serve as points of comparison. This has spurred a rush of projects to either identify a unique genetic signature for every species, such as the International Barcode of Life, or sequence the whole genomes of as many species as possible (see chart). The $4.7bn Earth Biogenome Project aims to sequence 1.5m species in ten years. As well as collecting and preserving genomes, such genetic databases can be mined for information on susceptibility to disease, or for potential medicines.</p>
<p>But even though genetic sequencing has become much cheaper since the late 20th century, it remains prohibitively expensive for most researchers outside America, Europe and China. Sequencing technologies are improving rapidly, however. In particular, Oxford Nanopore, a British company, has developed portable technology that allows sequencing to be done in the field, not just in the lab. It relies on nanopore sequencing, a technique in which strands of dna are drawn through a nanometre-sized pore in a biological membrane. Each of the four letters of the dna alphabet produces a distinct electrical signal as it passes through the pore, allowing the sequence to be read in real time.</p>
<p>Oxford Nanopore’s Min ion, a usb-powered, pocket-sized device, allows every part of the sequencing process to be done in the field. Sequences are produced within an hour. The devices are relatively affordable: prices start at around $1,000, though subsequent recharges are needed to run more samples. They have been used to sequence viruses in Brazil, amphibian dna in Tanzania and bacteria on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The technology also opens up new possibilities for investigation and enforcement. Genetic sequencing in the field can be used to identify the nature and origin of illegal bushmeat, fish or smuggled ivory. A paper published in Forensic Science International: Genetics in March 2021 compared results obtained by the Min ion with the standard sequencing methods used in wildlife forensics. It found the results to be comparable, potentially paving the way for handheld devices to be used in wildlife-crime prosecutions.</p>

<p>Ecology lends itself to being helped along by the keen layperson perhaps more than any other science. For decades, birdwatchers have recorded their sightings and sent them to organisations like Britain’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, or the Audubon society in America, contributing precious data about population size, trends, behaviour and migration. These days, any smartphone connected to the internet can be pointed at a plant to identify a species and add a record to a regional data set.</p>
<p>ocial-media platforms have further transformed things, adding big data to weekend ecology. In 2002, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York created eBird, a free app available in more than 30 languages that lets twitchers upload and share pictures and recordings of birds, labelled by time, location and other criteria. More than 100m sightings are now uploaded annually, and the number is growing by 20% each year. In May the group marked its billionth observation. The Cornell group also runs an audio library with 1m bird calls, and the Merlin app, which uses eBird data to identify species from pictures and descriptions.</p>
<p>All these data are used to generate detailed maps and forecasts of species distribution, abundance, migrations, and snapshots of how populations are changing and adapting to their environment. They feed into hundreds of academic papers and national conservation assessments such as the 2020 State of India’s Birds, the first attempt to classify Indian birds according to their extinction risk. The analysis of 867 species found that many of those that were thought to be widespread were in fact endangered.</p>
<p>There are many other such projects. Nearly 4m amateur ecologists have signed up to iNaturalist, a social network run jointly by the California Academy of Science and the National Geographic Society. Its users have contributed 66m observations of more than 300,000 species (see chart). Such apps engage people in their natural environment, “a really important and overlooked aspect of the interface between technology and conservation,” says Joe Walston of the Wildlife Conservation Society (wcs) in New York. Collective interest on public forums can help create new protected areas. In 2016, wcs worked with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a research institute, to drop hydrophones in the Hudson river to monitor passing whales. The data were made publicly available and the research was discussed in local news. Pressure from New Yorkers, astonished to find that they had a resident whale population, led to changes in shipping lanes and speeds, in order to create less disturbance for the whales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, researchers faced with having to sift through thousands of hours of images recorded by camera traps have found willing helpers in armchair ecologists. Penguin Watch, for instance, recruits people to go through images collected by camera traps that are trained on Antarctica’s penguin colonies.</p>
<p>Increasingly, some of this work is being handed to machine-learning algorithms that are trained to recognise particular species. Wild Me, an ngo based in Oregon, has taken the idea one step further. It provides online platforms where users upload pictures that are then run through image-recognition software. Just like facial-recognition systems, the software can recognise specific individuals belonging to species that have identifying features such as spots or stripes. So far, Wild Me has applied this approach to 53 species, including clouded leopards, skunks and leopard sharks. As pictures are added to the platforms, each individual can be tracked as it develops and moves around its region or the globe.</p>
<p>Facebook for zebras<br>One of the group’s early projects involved a collaboration with the Grevy’s Zebra Trust in Kenya, which organises an annual two-day rally in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to capture as many pictures as possible of the eponymous endangered equine. Participants, including scientists and members of the public, are given guidelines on how to photograph animals, record gps co-ordinates and feed pictures into the Wild Me algorithm, which uses the animals’ distinctive stripe patterns to identify individuals. With repeated surveys, the zebras’ population structure, movements and evolution can be monitored. The work has shown that lions were killing more young zebras than the group could sustain, leading the park to change its management of the lion population. It is now a key component of the official population assessment of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p>
<p>Images uploaded to Wild Me range from tourist snaps to pictures from camera traps or drones. Researchers can reconstruct the recent history of a species by uploading their entire backlog of camera-trap pictures. The Wild Me team has also been harnessing data generated by inadvertent ecologists in the form of pictures and videos posted on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or Flickr. “In 2018, just by taking publicly posted videos of whale sharks, there were more sightings than all the human contributors combined from all the other sources,” says Tanya Berger-Wolf, a co-founder.</p>
<p>There is, however, a downside to making reams of gps-tagged data of endangered species publicly available online. In January 2020, within hours of a picture of an elephant being posted on social media, a poaching attempt was made on the very same animal. On that occasion, the elephant escaped. Aware of the delicate balance that needs to be struck between sharing and protecting conservation data, conservationists have started advocating “privacy for tigers”. Groups like Wild Me and iNaturalist strip or hide geotags from their images. But webcams of nature reserves around the world can be watched, live, by anyone with an internet connection. In the space of 30 minutes, your correspondent jumped between elephants drinking from a watering hole to lion cubs playing in long grass to a herd of elk striding across the Canadian Arctic. The location of each camera was clearly indicated—and was thus available to poachers. </p>

<p>Every few weeks from June 1963 until July 1968, Robert Paine, a zoologist, made the journey from Seattle, where he taught at the University of Washington, across Puget Sound to the rocky shores of Mukkaw bay. There, he had found virtually pristine tide pools that teamed with life—limpets, anemones, mussels, seaweeds and purple-and-orange seastars known as Pisaster ochraceus. The unspoiled landscape offered the perfect setting for what was to become a seminal experiment in ecology. On each visit, Dr Paine systematically removed all the seastars he could find from one patch of rock, lobbing them as far as he could into the waves.</p>
<p>He did this for five years, all the while carefully documenting how the shoreline communities evolved. Very little changed in the untouched areas. But in his seastar-free zone, everything was altered. Pisaster is a greedy carnivore that feasts on mussels, barnacles, limpets and snails. Released from their predator, these species began to spread out. The acorn barnacles took over first. Later, they were displaced by goose barnacles and mussels. By removing just one species, Dr Paine had triggered a domino effect. Soon, the number of species in the community had dropped from 15 to eight. By 1968, the mussels had taken over completely.</p>
<p>Dr Paine dubbed Pisaster a “keystone species”; remove it and the ecosystem is transformed. Large herbivores like rhinos are keystone species, spreading seeds of the plants they consume across vast areas, thus maintaining or altering vegetation. In the kelp forests of the Pacific Northwest, sea otters play a keystone role by munching on sea urchins. The urchins graze on kelp and, left unchecked, are capable of wiping out entire kelp forests on which fish and seals depend.</p>
<p>Keystone species illustrate the complex webs of interactions that underpin biodiversity. Understanding, let alone predicting, the impact that removing one species can have on the rest of a non-linear system is devilishly complicated. Even if sensors and ecologists could log the identity and location of every living creature on the planet, such data would be worth little without an understanding of how everything relates to everything else.</p>
<p>Computer models are ideally suited to providing just that. General circulation models, for example, simulate the planetary climate, linking the physics that govern the formation and disintegration of ice sheets to the huge currents that push water through the ocean, and oceanic temperature gradients to the formation of storm systems over the continents. These models are so complex that they take months to run, even on the world’s most powerful supercomputers. Climate science and policy would be nothing without them.</p>
<p>Ecology has few equivalents. One reason is that ecosystems are much harder to simulate. “In a physical system, you have a set of atoms or molecules that behave in a predictable way, even if it is complex,” says Derek Tittensor, a marine-ecosystem modeller at Dalhousie University in Canada. Ecology, by contrast, deals in living things, whose interactions are determined by the unpredictable behaviour of individuals.</p>
<p>Added to this is the complexity of the pressures and stresses that modify ecosystems. Carbon dioxide and methane are produced by different processes and behave differently in the atmosphere, but fundamentally they both warm the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels also produces a mix of particles which cool the climate. These emissions are all very different, but their effects can, to some approximation, be reduced to a single variable known as their “global-warming potential”. Ecosystems, by contrast, are affected by warming temperatures and changing water cycles, but also by chemical pollution, urban encroachment, hunting and overfishing. None of this can be reduced to just one or even a handful of quantitative variables.</p>
<p>And so ecosystem modelling remains in its infancy. Statistical models, built on relationships between historical data sets—for example, how the amount of vegetation in a tropical forest tends to grow or shrink as temperatures and rainfall vary—are easier to build, and have progressed furthest. But they cannot capture or predict the dynamic, non-linear ways ecosystems respond to change, including the tipping points at which cumulative damage to an ecosystem suddenly shifts it into a new regime, for example when deforestation tips a region from forest to savannah.</p>
<p>Doing that requires “process-based” or “mechanistic” models, which are harder to build, but can produce non-linearity and emergent behaviour. They are the ecological equivalent of general circulation models, and operate as fully functioning simulations of Earth’s biosphere. They are particularly useful for unpicking what is driving change in an ecosystem. If a fish population is growing, is it because rising temperatures have driven predators away, or because deforestation on land nearby is releasing iron-rich dust which is fertilising the local plankton population?</p>
<p>Marine science has produced a number of process-based models, though they are less uniform in their design than climate models. Some are built around food chains and the way they move biomass and energy around ecosystems; others focus on how well-suited different species are to particular ecological niches, or group species and their interactions based on body size, which is a reasonable predictor of an organism’s place in the food chain.</p>
<p>Over the past decade marine-ecosystem modellers have formed the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project. Its goal is to determine how fishing and climate change are likely to alter marine fisheries around the world, which provide 11% of the animal protein humans consume. “Fish-mip” develops standardised scenarios that can be run across global and regional marine-ecosystem models. As with climate modelling, the idea is to run the same simulations on different models and combine the results into robust projections that can inform policy decisions. Fish-mip studies suggest that larger fish species, which make up most of what humans consume, are affected most by climate change, as are the tropics, where people tend to be more dependent on catches and more vulnerable to economic instability and poor nutrition.</p>
<p>But simulating the effects of fishing operations is more complicated than studying the impact of rising temperatures, as assumptions have to be made about a range of variables, from how the industry will redistribute fishing fleets as fish migrate towards the poles, to how fishing technology will change, and whether changing attitudes towards sustainability will mean more marine protected areas. The climate-modelling community handles such uncertainty by drawing up standardised hypothetical scenarios and producing climate projections for each one. But the scenarios do not yet take into account the ways in which humans effect biodiversity, such as by overfishing.</p>
<p>Modelling is far less advanced for land ecosystems. “Dynamic global vegetation models” can simulate human impacts on plants but do not represent non-human animals. And though there are at least eight global marine-ecosystem models that simulate life in the ocean, there is just one process-based model that includes life on land: the Madingley model, first published in 2014, which represents life both on land and in the ocean.</p>
<p>Named after the village in Britain where it was devised, it breaks down land and ocean into grid cells that are up to 200 square km (77 square miles). Climatic conditions are set for each cell, which are also populated with organisms, so long as they weigh more than ten micrograms. To simplify the equations involved, the model groups organisms by size, habitat and function. It therefore cannot distinguish between two species of small songbird that live in the same region, but it does simulate interactions between, say, megafauna and their prey.</p>
<p>All this allows for in silico experiments in which all the world’s top predators are wiped out entirely, an extension in space of Dr Paine’s famous seastar experiment but also an extrapolation of current global trends. An assessment in 2014 of 31 of the world’s largest mammalian carnivores found that three-quarters of them were in decline, and 17 occupied less than half of their historical territory. Using the Madingley model, Selwyn Hoeks at Radboud University in the Netherlands, and his colleagues found that removing all carnivores weighing more than 21kg triggered a domino effect in food chains with the net result that the total amount of vegetation on Earth decreased. Their results were published in 2020 in the journal Ecography.</p>
<p>Ecologists have long argued that conserving large carnivores has tangible benefits beyond the cuddly feeling of saving tigers. According to the “green Earth hypothesis”, no carnivores means more herbivores and thus fewer plants. Vegetation soaks up carbon dioxide, so less plant life would amplify global warming. What of the reverse, where all plant life is gradually removed? Changing landscapes, particularly through agriculture, is humanity’s greatest impact on biodiversity, and one that is likely to increase. Expanding agriculture reduces the amount of plant life at the base of food webs. Tim Newbold, of University College London, and colleagues simulated the removal of increasing amounts of vegetation from China, France, Libya and Uganda. They found that once 80% of plant life was gone, entire food chains began to collapse and could not be rebuilt by simply restoring the plants.</p>
<p>As well as predicting outcomes, global ecosystem models make it possible to test policies. What would be the consequence of reintroducing a species from a population bred in captivity? Would the decline of a species be halted or reversed if a percentage of its territorial range were protected, or would it be more efficient to create a corridor between two existing protected areas?</p>
<p>Carbon storage, clean water, clean air, abundant crops and fish are all examples of “ecosystem services” that benefit humanity. The principle is undeniable on a grand scale, but the details are harder to map. “We don’t have any frameworks which link biodiversity changes to changes in ecosystem functioning, and on to the services that humans derive from those ecosystems,” says Michael Harfoot of the un World Conservation Monitoring Centre and co-author of the Ecography paper.</p>
<p>Statistical models try to infer changes in ecosystem services from, for instance, trends in forest cover. But process-based models need further refinement so that changes in temperatures or land use can be linked to changes in biodiversity—and then, in turn, to the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide. “That is probably the next big frontier for ecosystem modelling,” says Dr Harfoot, “and essentially, also, for conservation.”</p>
<p>For now, this remains some way off. Today’s ecosystem models are widely compared to where climate models were in their earliest days of development, about 50 years ago. “Given the urgency of the situation, we need ecosystem models to be where climate models will be in ten years’ time,” says Dr Newbold. </p>

<p>Late one day in April 2002, a delicate blue-beige bird with a white collar and black eye mask was released into the dense forest on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The bird, a female, was one of just three remaining po’ouli (pronounced poh-oh-oolee), a species of honeycreeper that had been discovered in 1973. Believing there to be one male among the three, researchers were desperate to arrange a match. The birds, however, did not appear in the least bit concerned about the fate of their species. To help things along, earlier that day a team had caught the female, fitted her with a small radio transmitter and set her free where the male had last been seen. The next morning they set off with aerials to track the female’s progress. They soon found her, resolutely making her way back across the island to her own territory.</p>
<p>Conservation is full of such failed romances. When a species is reduced to a few individuals, researchers will go to great lengths to set up arranged marriages. If wild matings cannot be facilitated, they may try to breed animals in captivity and then release them back into the wild. Thus, the California condor was brought back from 22 individuals; the Arabian oryx from just nine. With the po’ouli, the decision was made to bring the reluctant trio in for captive breeding. The male was caught in September 2004. He was old, had only one eye and died a few weeks later. The other two birds were spotted around the same time, then never seen again.</p>
<p>And that, you might think, was the end of the po’ouli’s tragic tale. But reproductive and genetic technologies developed in the past decade mean other outcomes are now conceivable, as it were. A cluster of cells from the one-eyed male is held at the San Diego Wildlife Biodiversity Bank, also known as the Frozen Zoo. Banking tissue samples from wild species is not unusual: seed banks have done this since the early 20th century. In the San Diego facility, however, tissue samples are not just stored, but are grown in living cell cultures. Oliver Ryder, director of conservation genetics, remembers peering through a microscope to look at the po’ouli’s chromosomes, aware that he was looking at the genetic material of a species that had already expired. “Extinction is, for a lot of people, kind of an abstract concept, but for some of us it has a really visceral feeling,” he says.</p>
<p>Dr Ryder and others are developing techniques that might, theoretically, make it possible to create a live newborn long after the last members of its species have died. They are not the first to attempt this. In 2009, a team of researchers announced they had delivered the kid of a bucardo, a species of wild goat that had gone extinct nine years earlier. A skin biopsy taken from the last female had produced live cells. The team removed the bundle of dna from inside those cells and injected it into the emptied eggs of a domestic goat. Using a zap of electricity, they fused the dna with the egg’s cellular “shell” and produced more than 400 embryos, all carrying the goat’s genes. Over 200 embryos were transferred to the wombs of surrogate domestic goats, leading to just one live birth. It was delivered by caesarean section in 2003, but lived for only “some minutes”, according to an account in the journal Theriogenology.</p>
<p>Not looking swell, Dolly<br>The technique that produced the short-lived bucardo kid was similar to that used to create Dolly, a cloned sheep, in 1996. Its dna was primarily inherited from a single individual. Even if it had lived, it could only ever have given rise to a population of clones, the opposite of biological diversity, for which genetic diversity is essential. Efforts to rescue a species from the brink of extinction must begin long before it is reduced to just one individual, or even three.</p>
<p>The po’ouli’s frozen cells, therefore, are unlikely ever to give rise to a new population of birds. But alongside them in San Diego are tubes that hold a different promise. They contain the remains of not one but 12 northern white rhinoceroses, five males and seven females. The northern white rhino is what is known as “functionally extinct”: the last male, Sudan, died in 2018, leaving behind just two females, a mother-and-daughter pair in Kenya, dubbed Najin and Fatu. Nevertheless, at a meeting in Vienna in 2015, researchers agreed on a twin-track approach to de-extinction.</p>
<p>The first approach, led by a group called BioRescue, uses a version of in-vitro fertilisation involving rather more international travel than most human procedures. Five times since 2019, a team of researchers, conservationists, park rangers and veterinarians have gathered in the park to harvest oocytes (immature egg cells) from the ovaries of one or both females, who are placed under general anaesthetic for the procedure. The oocytes are immediately flown to Italy, where they are fertilised with thawed sperm from a dead male whose cells are banked in Germany. Sperm are injected through a needle directly into the eggs. They are then placed in a specially designed incubator equipped with a camera that allows the team to monitor the cells as they develop. Any embryos that successfully develop in the dish are placed in liquid nitrogen for safe-keeping until such a time as the team is ready to implant them into a womb.</p>
<p>The most recent egg collection was performed on March 28th. A total of 19 oocytes were obtained from Fatu; 14 were fertilised with sperm from Suni, a male who died in 2014. Four developed into viable embryos, bringing the total number of frozen embryos to nine. The next step will be to transfer embryos to a surrogate. Neither Najin nor Fatu is thought to be capable of a safe pregnancy, so the embryos will instead be entrusted to female southern white rhinos, a related species with a healthy wild population. Before implanting them, BioRescue has been testing the ivf procedure using southern white rhino cells. This has resulted in seemingly healthy embryos, but none has yet led to a live birth. The team hopes that doing the embryo transfers in the wild, rather than at a zoo in Europe, will improve the chances of success.</p>
<p>Thomas Hildebrandt of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, who is leading much of the work, says there is a short window for the transfers to happenbecause Najin and Fatu are both quite old. “We can try to preserve biological material very nicely,” he says, “but we can’t preserve social knowledge. And we have only two rhinos which can teach the calf how to behave as a northern white rhino.” Moreover, this ivf approach still faces the fundamental limits of genetic diversity. Fatu’s embryos carry only her and Suni’s genes. But the cells stored at -196°C in San Diego and other frozen stores carry much more, and they hold the key to the second strategy for saving the northern white rhino.</p>
<p>To determine whether they could theoretically build a healthy population, Dr Ryder sequenced the San Diego collection. “We found that there was more genetic variation in those 12 than in the [roughly 20,000-strong] standing population of southern white rhinos,” he says. “If we could turn those cells into animals, there is no reason the northern white rhino shouldn’t be able to recover.”</p>
<p>What is needed now is the means of turning frozen skin cells from long-dead rhinos into viable eggs. A way to do that has been demonstrated by Katsuhiko Hayashi, a reproductive biologist at Japan’s Kyushu University, and colleagues. In 2016, the team created baby mice from skin cells and sperm. They did this by taking cells from the tail tips of adult mice, growing them in culture, then flooding them with chemical signals that reprogrammed some of them to become “induced pluripotent stem cells”—special cells that can develop into any other cell found in the body, including oocytes. The oocytes were then fertilised and implanted into the wombs of surrogates, resulting in live mice, which went on to produce their own offspring.</p>
<p>A mouse, of course, is very different to a rhinoceros. Nevertheless, earlier this year, Marisa Korody of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla wrote that they had successfully reprogrammed skin cells belonging to nine of the 12 dead northern white rhinos to become induced pluripotent stem cells. BioRescue has had similar success. Not all such cells are truly pluripotent, so it is not a given that the team will be able to make oocytes. Initial tests, though, are promising.</p>
<p>Today, the frozen collection at the San Diego Wildlife Biodiversity Bank contains more than 10,000 cell lines belonging to 1,100 species and subspecies of vertebrates, plus tissue and blood samples that have not yet been cultured. Other biobanks are held by members of the Frozen Ark project, run by Britain’s University of Nottingham. Whether or not reviving extinct species becomes possible in the next few years, such biobanks can already be used to improve genetic diversity in endangered species. The American black-footed ferret, for example, was all but wiped out in the 20th century before being rescued through captive breeding of 18 surviving animals. In 2015 researchers showed that inseminating females with frozen sperm from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute could increase the ferrets’ genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Similar work could one day restore commercially valuable populations, such as threatened fisheries—but only if cells are banked now for an unknown future. That said, not all tissues lend themselves to being preserved in liquid nitrogen. Cryopreservation is also expensive and energy-intensive. So far, according to a paper published in July 2020 by Joseph Saragusty at the University of Teramo in Italy and colleagues, sperm from just 116 species, or approximately 2% of all mammals, have been preserved, as well as eggs from “just a handful” and embryos from 51 species. Live births produced from frozen mammalian sperm have been reported in only around 45 species. But cryopreservation can hold species in suspended animation while new technologies are invented or existing ones improved. As Kurt Benirschke, who founded the San Diego collection, had the foresight to declare: “You must collect things for reasons you don’t yet understand”. </p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Protecting the biological, ecological and genetic diversity that sustains life on Earth is the mission of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. But progress has been slow, to put it mildly. A list of 20 conservation targets, known as the Aichi targets, was drawn up in 2010, with a 2020 due date. In the event, not a single one of the goals was met in full (see chart).</p>
<p>In 2020, ipbes (the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, a body created to bridge the gap between biodiversity science and policy) published a global appraisal of the state of biodiversity. Written by 145 experts from 50 countries who reviewed 15,000 research and government sources, it offered a sobering message. “The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever,” said Sir Robert Watson, chairman of ipbes. “We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.”</p>
<p>According to the 2020 Living Planet Report, produced by wwf and the Zoological Society of London, two conservation and research groups, populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish shrank by 68% on average between 1970 and 2016. Two years earlier, it had found the decline to be 60% for the years spanning 1970 and 2014, suggesting that losses are accelerating. Human activity is thought to be causing species to disappear around 100 times faster than the natural background rate.</p>
<p>As this Technology Quarterly has shown, an explosion of technology, from nanopore dna sequencing to global computer models, is expanding human understanding of ecosystems. Yet most biodiversity indicators are still heading in an alarming direction. How can advances in technology be coupled to the policy changes needed to reverse the decline? It will require three things.</p>
<p>The first step is to knit together the various monitoring systems in order to provide a clear picture of what is going on and what needs to be done. The siloed nature of ecological science, in which teams focus on a particular animal, plant or ecological niche, has created a patchwork of initiatives and data rather than a comprehensive, global approach. At the moment it is not even possible to draw up an accurate summary of the number, location and type of different sensors around the world, let alone the species they are monitoring. Wildlife Insights, an online global repository for camera traps, has logged thousands of cameras, but is constantly discovering more. One country recently informed it that it had another 1,000 sensors that had not yet been logged, for example. A survey due to be published later this year by WildLabs, a network of conservation-technology users, found that financing, co-ordination and capacity-building are critical to the development and adoption of conservation technology.</p>
<p>Shared practices, databases and platforms, such as Wildlife Insights, are starting to close the gap. In addition, says Tanya Berger-Wolf, a computer scientist and ecologist at Ohio State University, ecosystem-wide observation networks are needed to measure everything from the structure of a landscape and its climatic conditions, to the location and identity of animal species, and how they interact with each other and with human infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second step is to create more powerful and detailed ecosystem models, so that they can be used to develop and analyse policy changes, for example on land use, fishing rights, farming practices and regulation of pollutants. Computer simulations have been instrumental in deepening the understanding of climate change, projecting future impacts, building public and political awareness, and designing policies. Global ecosystem models are decades behind by comparison. Better models would let policymakers set more specific and effective targets. The 2010 Aichi list was hopelessly detailed in its breakdown of what needed to be done, while remaining vague and qualitative about how targets should be met. Governments are now negotiating a new list, which is due to be signed off at an intergovernmental summit scheduled to take place in October 2021, setting goals for 2030 and 2050. Simple, quantifiable targets and clear methods for measuring success, as exist for climate change, are urgently needed.</p>
<p>Third, once monitoring systems, models and policies are in place, technology can help assess and enforce those policies, and make the case for adjusting or extending them as appropriate. If marine protected areas are expanded, for example, ecosystem monitoring can both measure the impact on fish stocks, and keep an eye out for unauthorised fishing boats.</p>
<p>All this will require funding for monitoring and enforcement. And at the moment, most technology for conservation is developed in rich countries, while most biodiversity is concentrated far away in poorer ones. Even when American or European kit makes it into the hands of researchers, park rangers or land managers, maintenance is a problem. More training, and greater use of open-source platforms that put knowledge in the hands of people on the ground, can help. But ultimately there will need to be broader mechanisms for richer countries to assist poorer ones.</p>
<p>Many of the necessary policies will overlap with those needed to address climate change. But not all of them. Understanding how ecosystems are changing, and measuring the impact and effectiveness of interventions, will be critical to conserving biodiversity. Technology cannot solve the problem on its own. But it is hard to imagine how the problem can be solved without it. </p>

<h1 id="Business-—Hard-truths-about-SoftBank"><a href="#Business-—Hard-truths-about-SoftBank" class="headerlink" title="(Business)—Hard truths about SoftBank"></a>(Business)—Hard truths about SoftBank</h1><p>The world’s most important tech-investing group has pulled off a stunning comeback. But some of its flaws remain</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Every day, from 8am to 10pm, Son Masayoshi sits in his mansion in Tokyo doing what entertains him like nothing else: sizing up technology entrepreneurs and handing out money. Working from home has not slowed down the billionaire boss of SoftBank. At the Japanese group’s earnings call on May 12th Masa, as he is universally known, boasted of backing 60 companies in three months. Between January and March he doled out $210m a week.</p>
<p>In the past four years SoftBank has poured $84bn or so into startups. It was the world’s biggest tech investor even before complementing a $98.6bn vehicle it runs, the Vision Fund, with a sibling that now contains $30bn. The 224 tech firms it has backed range from early-stage startups to established giants like ByteDance, owner of TikTok, a Gen-z time-sink. Names such as Plenty, Better and Forward imply missions to transform industries like food, health and banking. Going by the valuations used by SoftBank and other venture-capital (vc) funds, the backed companies are collectively worth a colossal $1.1trn, according to PitchBook, a data provider.</p>
<p>In spring 2020 SoftBank’s entire tech edifice nearly came tumbling down. As covid-19 spread and markets convulsed, SoftBank’s lenders took fright. Yields on its bonds surged. Investors wondered how—or if—Mr Son’s punts might weather the pandemic. His signature approach—big bets based less on spreadsheets than on “feeling the force” of a deal—looked riskier than ever. The initial public offering (ipo) of WeWork, an office-sharing firm, collapsed in late 2019, before the pandemic. Between February and March 2020, SoftBank’s share price plunged by over 50%.</p>
<p>“Masa got close to the flame,” sums up a person close to SoftBank. But then the markets rebounded. The Federal Reserve was pumping in liquidity by supporting the market for junk-rated corporate bonds (SoftBank’s debt is rated below investment grade). SoftBank announced a sale of $41bn of its $252bn in total assets in order to shore up its position.</p>
<p>Now Mr Son is once again looking like a genius. Backing tech darlings proved the perfect strategy in the digitally accelerated coronavirus economy. His hunches have paid off. In just over a year SoftBank has gone from survival mode to spewing out cash like a giant atm. The listing of Coupang, a South Korean e-merchant, reaped SoftBank $24bn in profits. Several more firms it has backed launched into an ipo market that turned red-hot last summer. Last month SoftBank reported an annual net profit of $46bn, the highest ever by a Japanese company. And more is to come: on June 10th Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing firm one-fifth-owned by SoftBank, said it would list its shares at a valuation of around $100bn. Despite a recent dip, SoftBank is worth a cool $126bn, $60bn more than at the trough in March 2020.</p>
<p>As one big SoftBank shareholder puts it, after a spell like this, “they are untouchable.” Forgotten was the fact SoftBank’s bumper profits followed one of the largest losses in Japanese corporate history a year earlier. Forgotten, too, was a familiar criticism of recent years: that Masa, who is ultimately responsible for every yen spent by the group, picks hyped investments.</p>
<p>Perhaps most forgotten of all is that SoftBank, having come to epitomise the tech wave, has occasionally acted in what some onlookers regard as questionable ways. It has eschewed common governance standards. It has become entangled in Europe’s two biggest corporate scandals in recent years: over Wirecard, a fraudulent German payments processor, and Greensill, a British supply-chain-finance firm now facing bankruptcy. And it has fused ever more closely with its founder.</p>
<p>Created by Mr Son in 1981 to distribute computer programs, SoftBank first delved into internet services in the 1990s before reinventing itself as a telecoms business. It bought the Japanese activities of Vodafone, a British mobile carrier, in 2006. In 2013 it bought Sprint, an American mobile provider. Along the way, in 2000, Mr Son paid $20m for a chunk of Chinese e-commerce upstart called Alibaba. That genius bet—Alibaba is now a global giant worth nearly $600bn—earned Mr Son kudos as a tech visionary. It also inspired him to transform SoftBank into an investment firm.</p>
<p>In 2018 Mr Son spun off some Japanese telecoms assets and unveiled the Vision Fund. Not content with raising a typical $1bn-10bn vc vehicle, with the help of Rajeev Misra, a well-connected ex-Deutsche Bank financier and Mr Son’s key lieutenant, SoftBank raised $45bn from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (pif) and $15bn from Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign-wealth fund. The Japanese firm put in $28bn of its own cash and assets, including a slice of Arm, a British microchip designer it had bought in 2016.</p>
<p>Today SoftBank is best understood as having four main parts. The most valuable by far is the 24.85% stake in Alibaba, worth $144bn. The second part contains its remaining mobile businesses and Arm (with Arm heading for disposal). SoftBank’s two Vision Funds make up the third portion. Finally comes Northstar, an internal hedge fund set up a year ago. At the centre sits Mr Son. “It’s one company, the Masa show, that’s it,” sums up a former executive.</p>
<p>Mr Son has two big ideas for the latest iteration of SoftBank. The first is to combine tech investing with financial engineering. In order to juice up returns, he has taken traditional vc and piled on leverage and complex structures. Second, Mr Son wants to create an over-arching tech “ecosystem” with SoftBank at its heart. Although SoftBank often owns only slivers of companies, he wants them to work together as if part of one group. The model is evocative of, if not identical to, the keiretsu—Japanese conglomerates such as Mitsubishi, with tentacles in finance, carmaking and lots besides, all helping each other.</p>
<p>It’s complicated<br>Start with the financial gymnastics. At SoftBank’s highest levels, close to Mr Son, is a group of traders who worked at Deutsche Bank at a time when the German lender was famous for its appetite for risk-taking. Chief among them is Mr Misra, who heads sbia, the part of SoftBank running the Vision Fund. “There are people at the Vision Fund whose entire raison d’être is financial engineering,” says a person who knows SoftBank well. “Complexity is their best friend—if they want to get from a to b they will go through all the letters of the alphabet to get there.” Mr Son appears to prefer their swashbuckling ways to those of old-school, more conservative vc types.</p>
<p>It was such ways that brought SoftBank into the Wirecard fiasco. In early 2019 the German firm’s share price had fallen by half from its peak in late 2018 after reports of accounting irregularities. On March 28th 2019 Wirecard, by then a member of Germany’s blue-chip dax 30 index, said it was suing the Financial Times over a series of investigative reports. At that moment another ex-Deutsche Bank trader at SoftBank, Akshay Naheta, chose to back the controversial company with the full weight of his employer’s reputation.</p>
<p>On April 24th 2019 Wirecard announced that a SoftBank “affiliate” would invest €900m ($1bn) via a convertible bond. SoftBank also struck a co-operation agreement with Wirecard that opened the way for the payments firm to do business with other SoftBank companies, including those in the Vision Fund. The apparent validation of Wirecard by the world’s largest tech investor sparked a 21% rise in the German firm’s share price. It also bolstered Wirecard’s creditworthiness.</p>
<p>The Wirecard deal had two unusual aspects. For a start, it turned out to be ephemeral. It later emerged that the €900m bond was subject to a refinancing exercise almost as soon as it was issued, reaping an immediate €64m profit. When Wirecard went bust in June 2020, after the FT’s reporting proved accurate, it was other investors who lost out.</p>
<p>Another oddity was that SoftBank itself put no money into Wirecard. The “affiliate” fund that did was managed by sbia, the Vision Fund overseer. Its investors included a small group of individual SoftBank executives aiming to make a personal profit, among them Mr Naheta, Mr Misra and Sago Katsunori, SoftBank’s former strategy chief, and one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign-wealth funds. Wirecard publicised its agreement with SoftBank to financial markets, an association that for SoftBank carried reputational risk given the FT’s reporting on Wirecard. In the end the bulk of the immediate profit on the bond trade went to the affiliate’s individual investors, not to SoftBank or its shareholders. Wirecard’s later implosion confirmed the reputational risk that SoftBank had run. A person familiar with the matter also confirmed that the position of the sbia-managed affiliate fund meant it stood to lose potential gains if Wirecard went bankrupt.</p>
<p>One person in the know describes Mr Naheta and colleagues as putting a team to work to introduce Wirecard to certain Vision Fund portfolio companies, in accordance with a co-operation agreement between sbia and Wirecard. These portfolio firms included stars of the tech world, whose tacit endorsements could have given the ailing German company a public-relations fillip—possibly boosting the SoftBank executives’ returns. In the event, Vision Fund firms avoided Wirecard owing to the FT’s reporting.</p>
<p>Northstar is another example of Mr Son’s embrace of high finance. SoftBank’s newest unit looks like the exact opposite of Mr Son’s self-proclaimed desire to back exciting new firms and think in terms of an investment horizon stretching 300 years into the future. Northstar’s mandate seems to be to make short-term bets on public stocks that anyone with access to a brokerage account could buy or sell. One reason for this apparent departure from Mr Son’s guiding philosophy was that SoftBank had cash lying around. When the financial pinch of the early pandemic eased, some proceeds from the $41bn of asset sales could be reinvested. Most companies park spare cash in dull securities like government bonds. But that is not the Masa way.</p>
<p>Instrumental to Northstar is Mr Naheta, who runs the unit. The 39-year-old was not the obvious pick to head a fund placing some of the world’s biggest stockmarket bets. After leaving Deutsche Bank he set up his own stock-picking firm, which seems to have focused on mid-cap stocks. Northstar, by contrast, has deployed huge sums of money, using SoftBank’s spare cash magnified by leverage. Last September investors started noticing that one market player’s tech-focused bets were so big (and structured in such a complex way) that it single-handedly caused some companies’ share prices to rocket. It was not long before Northstar was unmasked as the “Nasdaq Whale”. It lost $5.6bn on derivative transactions in the year to March 2021.</p>
<p>In what appeared to be a letter in response to a freedom-of-information request by PlainSite, an investigative news outlet, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in March it was investigating SoftBank. A SoftBank spokesperson says the company is “not aware of any sec investigation into the company’s securities trading and has not been notified of such”.</p>
<p>Techno-ecology<br>If Wirecard and Northstar exemplify Mr Son’s penchant for financial gymnastics, the story of Greensill’s rise and fall highlights the dangers of its ecosystem. SoftBank touts this as a competitive advantage. It regularly hosts get-togethers for all the founders whose firms it has backed. At its best the ecosystem can be a way for entrepreneurs to share ideas, bolster sales and boost prospects. But it can also lead companies in which SoftBank is a minority shareholder to feel the need to favour other parts of the ecosystem—even if this is not obviously in the interest of non-SoftBank investors or counterparties. SoftBank says its portfolio firms “have full autonomy to decide whether or not to work together”.</p>
<p>For SoftBank, Greensill could serve multiple purposes. Its Australian founder, Lex Greensill, had a well-rehearsed story about using tech to transform a stultified industry—Masa’s special formula. Greensill could be used for the benefit of SoftBank’s ecosystem. Its flagship product involved making loans to tide companies over after they issued invoices to customers but before they received payments. Greensill then repackaged these invoice-backed loans and sold them to investors. Credit Suisse, a bank, offered to pitch funds full of those bonds to clients, including family offices and corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>Mr Son called Mr Greensill the “money guy”. Starting in May 2019 the Vision Fund invested $1.4bn in Greensill, turning its founder into a paper billionaire. Early last year the investment started proving its value. Some companies in the Vision Fund badly needed money. Firms like Katerra, a now-bankrupt American construction startup, found that building houses could not easily be made cheaper and faster with software. Oyo, an Indian hotel group, tried to expand too quickly. After the WeWork debacle potential lenders steered clear of many Vision Fund firms. Greensill could help fill the hole. It lent money to Katerra and Oyo—or, rather, Credit Suisse clients did so indirectly. At times it was not in SoftBank’s interest for some of its portfolio firms to raise fresh equity: a lower valuation might oblige SoftBank to revalue its shareholding, generating a loss. Having Greensill on hand to extend loans to struggling firms proved useful in the end.</p>
<p>This introduced potential conflicts of interest. SoftBank invested in the company that made the loan (Greensill) and in those it lent to (Katerra, Oyo and others). SoftBank invested over $500m in Credit Suisse funds. Greensill’s demise means its erstwhile backer can paint itself as one of its financial victims. A former SoftBank executive familiar with the matter says the situation was complex but that conflicts of interest could be managed. Credit Suisse, for one, is unimpressed. It is preparing for litigation against SoftBank. A SoftBank spokesperson says that “Any potential conflicts were appropriately managed in accordance with existing sbia policies.”</p>
<p>In late 2019 it seemed that SoftBank might take a different, less controversial path. SoftBank’s shares were trading at an estimated 70-75% discount to the value of the company stakes it owned, a historic low on that measure. Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund from New York, spotted an opportunity. Simplifying SoftBank’s structure, improving governance and returning money to shareholders were all time-tested ways to cause the conglomerate discount to narrow. The early-pandemic scare forced Mr Son’s hand. The $41bn of asset sales included most of SoftBank’s remaining American telecoms businesses. It is selling Arm to Nvidia, a bigger chipmaker (the deal awaits regulatory approval). This streamlined the group somewhat. But it accelerated the metamorphosis from a juiced-up telecoms utility into a complex investment holding company.</p>
<p>Elliott’s prodding prompted some standard-issue governance improvements, such as appointing a woman to its all-male board and lifting the number of independent directors. As of June 2021, four out of nine board directors count as independents, up from three out of 12 in January 2019. Yet few observers think this resolves all potential problems. Since the start of last year SoftBank has suffered departures of highly experienced senior executives involved in legal affairs and compliance. A shared concern, according to a person close to some of them, was SoftBank’s culture. The firm is alleged to be permissive of conflicts of interest. The use of financial intermediaries was another concern.</p>
<p>The latest person to announce her departure was Kawamoto Yuko, SoftBank’s first female director and a respected corporate-governance expert. She left after just a year to take a job as a commissioner at Japan’s National Personnel Authority, having reportedly disagreed with Mr Son over internal controls. On May 21st she published a description of governance at SoftBank, calling for more internal checks and more dissenting voices. She commented that it would be nice if the “obligation to dissent” or to disagree when necessary was more widespread throughout SoftBank. SoftBank says that “constructive debate is the sign of an effective board” and that Ms Kawamoto agreed with governance changes including the appointment of a chief risk officer, which she had suggested. “She did not leave because of a disagreement, but rather because she was appointed to a government position,” a SoftBank spokesperson says.</p>
<p>Under the existing governance arrangements, potentially problematic dealings can crop up. In return for facilitating the SoftBank affiliate’s convertible-bond deal, for instance, Wirecard and sbia paid multimillion-dollar success fees to a German financier, Christian Angermayer, according to the FT. In another example, last summer Marcelo Claure, SoftBank’s chief operating officer, bought 5m shares of t-Mobile, a mobile operator, for around $500m. The purchase was funded by a loan from SoftBank. t-mobile’s share price has risen, and Mr Claure will keep the upside. But had it fallen, SoftBank would have had to find a way to get hundreds of millions of dollars back from its own executive. A SoftBank spokesperson says “the loan to acquire t-Mobile shares further aligns the interests of SoftBank shareholders with management. Under the terms of our merger agreement, SoftBank stockholders will receive over $7bn in t-Mobile equity if the company continues to perform and achieves a stock price of $150.”</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the Vision Fund, in at least one case an executive invested privately in an unlisted firm before SoftBank backed it, resulting in a large valuation increase. Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at sbia, made a personal investment in Petuum, an artificial-intelligence startup founded in 2016, before leading the Vision Fund’s $93m bet on the firm in 2017. SoftBank’s policies let Mr Nishar keep the personal investment, which was disclosed to the Vision Fund’s limited partners. SoftBank says that “the investments in Petuum were disclosed, complied with the firm’s policies, and are relatively common practice in growth-stage investing.” Other vc firms call such a practice rare, and typically require executives to sell equity stakes in a company at cost to their firm in such situations.</p>
<p>Another big question governance experts have wrestled with is where SoftBank ends and Mr Son’s individual interests begin. The boundaries are seemingly not always clear. Some of the firm’s activities are designed so an outsized share of profits flows to Mr Son relative to other SoftBank shareholders. Take Northstar. When it was set up, a third of the money invested was Mr Son’s; that brings him a third of the profits generated by the fund. But Northstar—and so Mr Son personally—benefit from belonging to SoftBank, roughly 70% of which is owned by other shareholders. Its trades are either explicitly or implicitly backed by SoftBank’s balance-sheet.</p>
<p>An obvious potential problem with a ceo having a personal interest in a particular division of his firm is that such a boss cannot neutrally allocate capital. Diverting cash to Northstar, in this case, can lead to its profits surging—and flowing in part to Mr Son. Northstar’s structure, including Mr Son’s personal stake in it, was approved by SoftBank’s board, which discussed the matter independently of Mr Son.</p>
<p>Not so loanly<br>SoftBank insists its governance and finances are sound. It has long had a policy of keeping enough money on hand to repay all its bonds that mature in the next two years. The asset disposals after last year’s crisis resulted in a less indebted group. SoftBank says it does not want to borrow more than a quarter of the value of the holdings (for example in Alibaba) that are often used as collateral for the loans.</p>
<p>This is only a partial comfort to minority shareholders and other observers. SoftBank’s professed leverage cap is high by investment firms’ standards. Standard &amp; Poor’s (s&amp;p), a credit-rating agency, says it disagrees with how SoftBank calculates the ratio of credit to assets. SoftBank says that s&amp;p calculates the ratio using its own methodology; it has revised its rating outlook for SoftBank from negative to stable. Some of the investment holding companies rated by s&amp;p receive higher ratings than SoftBank even though their ratios after s&amp;p’s adjustments are weaker than SoftBank’s. A SoftBank spokesman says that as it establishes a record of improvement this will help s&amp;p’s ratio level. The company is “continuing our communication with [s&amp;p] for upgrading”.</p>
<p>Borrowing pops up across the company. The Vision Fund can borrow against companies it owns, which are themselves indebted. Mr Son is known to have pledged his own shares in SoftBank to fund activities related to the firm. Moody’s, another credit-rating firm, describes the resulting capital structure as fluid, complex and having limited transparency. Analysts gripe that disclosure is patchy at best.</p>
<p>Corporate governance, debt, SoftBank’s association with Wirecard and Greensill: none is likely to be troubling Mr Son right now. The signs are he feels emboldened after surviving the corporate version of a 100-year flood. This carries risks, warns a SoftBank shareholder: “Masa and the senior team have been so successful, there is a feeling of ‘can everyone just leave us alone’…That could be dangerous if they think there is less need to take notice of corporate governance.” Investors were surprised by the news in May that instead of continuing to buy back shares, as they would like, Mr Son is tripling the size of Vision Fund 2, from $10bn to $30bn. Unlike the first Vision Fund, where outside limited partners sometimes acted as a brake, the new fund has no external investors.</p>
<p>Masa seems to have been given even freer rein to feel the force. On June 10th the new fund led a $639m investment in Klarna, a Swedish fintech firm. That and other similar-sized bets are much larger than last year’s investments of under $100m. SoftBank has set up three special-purpose acquisition companies hoping to raise a combined $1bn or so, and then merge with startups—possibly including, SoftBank has said, some in the two Vision Funds. That would kick up still more potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>The bull case for SoftBank is simple. It is an unabashed wager on tech-fuelled firms continuing their meteoric rise. It can thrive as long as investors are on hand to fund loss-making companies in the hope of future riches. For now, they are. But the recent ipo boom is petering out. Much of SoftBank’s record profit came with an asterisk: the share prices that helped generate it had already started falling back to Earth. Coupang has lost a fifth of its market value since listing. SoftBank and its shareholders are aware the party in the markets could come to an end, especially if central banks raise the ultra-low interest rates that make borrowing cheap and growth stocks appealing. Masa’s rebound last year was swift—but also lucky. The next stress test for SoftBank may not be far off. </p>

<h1 id="Hit-by-covid-19-Italian-makeup-makers-are-looking-pretty-again"><a href="#Hit-by-covid-19-Italian-makeup-makers-are-looking-pretty-again" class="headerlink" title="Hit by covid-19, Italian makeup-makers are looking pretty again"></a>Hit by covid-19, Italian makeup-makers are looking pretty again</h1><p>Cosmetics firms clustered around Milan stand to benefit from long-term trends in the industry</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Twenty years ago Leonard Lauder, the heir to the Estée Lauder beauty empire, observed that during economic downturns consumers liked to sweeten belt-tightening with small indulgences. He called it the “lipstick effect”, after one common pick-me-up. Disappointingly for Italy’s “lipstick valley”, a part of Lombardy that, according to Cosmetica Italia, an industry group, produces 55% of the world’s eye shadows, mascaras, face powder and lipsticks, consumers mostly shunned these little luxuries amid the pandemic recession. Whether because maquillage is less meaningful on grainy Zoom calls or contoured lips invisible behind face-masks, sales of Italian makeup-makers fell by 13% last year.</p>
<p>Luckily for Italy’s beauty firms, shoppers are desperate to show their faces in public again. “When the masks come off in June people will go crazy,” predicts Dario Ferrari, who founded and runs Intercos, the valley’s biggest firm and the world’s largest contract manufacturer for makeup. Denizens of lipstick valley also stand to benefit from two longer-term trends: the rise of the image-conscious Asian shopper and of direct-to-consumer makeup brands that need contract manufacturers to bring their Instagram feeds to life.</p>
<p>Lipstick valley is the latest industrial cluster to emerge in northern Italy. Although France makes more cosmetics, including skincare and body lotions, Italy has carved out a niche in makeup. The environs of Crema, a medieval city an hour’s drive to the east of Milan, in particular attracted such companies starting in the late 1990s, with proximity to the creative ferment of the Milanese fashion scene as well as the technical expertise of an earlier cluster of chemicals firms. Intesa Sanpaolo, a bank, reckons that around 350 cosmetics startups were created between 2012 and 2017, mostly in lipstick valley.</p>
<p>Today the area is home to more than 1,000 companies in the makeup sector, which generate annual revenues of €12bn ($14.5bn). In the few years before the pandemic they were benefiting from the bright and brash beauty trends rewarded on social media. Lipstick valley was in expansion mode. Ancorotti Cosmetics, a family firm which makes one-fifth of the world’s mascaras, acquired and repurposed a factory near Crema once owned by Olivetti, a defunct industrial giant.</p>
<p>Mr Ferrari is confident that his company will recover swiftly from the slump. Sales in March were already higher than in the same month in pre-pandemic 2019, he reports. He is particularly bullish on custom from upstart brands. Luca Solca of Bernstein, a broker, says that the combination of social media and digital distribution has led to greater fragmentation of the beauty business. Two decades ago the vast majority of Intercos’s sales went to traditional beauty firms such as Estée Lauder or L’Oréal. Today only half do; direct-to-consumer brands account for about a third (the rest is bought by retailers like Sephora for their private labels). ”You can come to us and we can make a brand in six months,” Mr Ferrari boasts.</p>
<p>He is also eyeing Asia. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, expects sales of cosmetics in China alone to double between 2019 and 2025, to $145bn. Last year Intercos took full control of a joint venture with Shinsegae, a South Korean retailer, which allows Intercos to manufacture Shinsegae’s popular brands—and also tap into k-beauty trends, which have conquered the world. It already manufactures products for Perfect Diary, an Instagrammable Chinese brand whose parent company, Yatsen Holding, listed in New York last year.</p>
<p>Mr Ferrari’s fellow lipstick-valley bosses are likewise looking east. Investors—including eastern ones—are in turn looking at them. In December gic, Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund, bought a minority stake in Mr Ferrari’s family holding company. Giovanni Foresti of Intesa Sanpaolo calculates that Italian cosmetics-makers’ retained earnings are higher than for the average domestic manufacturer and they spend much more on research and development. Before the pandemic Mr Ferrari was planning to list Intercos on Milan’s bourse. No wonder bankers are nagging him to revive the idea. </p>

<h1 id="How-to-pick-the-best-days-to-work-from-home"><a href="#How-to-pick-the-best-days-to-work-from-home" class="headerlink" title="How to pick the best days to work from home"></a>How to pick the best days to work from home</h1><p>Timing is everything</p>
<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>Hybrid working may be the future but that raises the question of how it will actually be organised. Will companies let their employees choose which days they come in to the office, and which days they are at home? And what about working hours? If employees do get a choice, they clearly need a strategy to maximise their visibility and minimise the stress. So this columnist has a few tips about which days you should opt to work from home.</p>
<p>Monday: Too obvious. You might as well say, “I’ve been drinking all weekend and I’m too hung over to come in.” In the 18th and early 19th centuries, when people were paid on Saturdays, absenteeism on the first official day of the working week was so common it was known as “Saint Monday”, because it felt almost like a second sabbath.</p>
<p>From the working point of view, Mondays are usually a day when some sort of team meeting is held and the priorities are set for the rest of the week. It would seem best to head in to the office on that day and postpone the time for solitary working until later in the week. Showing your enthusiasm to the boss by turning up on the first day of the week is probably a good idea as well.</p>
<p>Tuesday: Some people might not like the pattern created by spending Tuesdays at home, as it breaks the working week into two unequal chunks. Not Bartleby, who used to work from home that day before the pandemic struck, completing the column (taking out the typos, axing the non sequiturs and polishing the puns). Still, besides breaking up the week, home working on Tuesday also seems likely to be a day few others might choose. And then there is nothing more satisfying than looking out of the window and watching everyone else heading off to work, while you sit in your slippers, sipping a coffee.</p>
<p>Wednesday: Remote working on this day would appeal to Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie’s detective who was fond of symmetry and order. Two days of working in the office, a day at home, two more days in the office and then a two-day weekend. It doesn’t fit with The Economist’s schedule (Wednesday is deadline day). It is nevertheless a good one to pick. Ignore the “Wednesday’s child is full of woe” propaganda. Companies will probably be happy to allow employees to choose this day, as Mondays and Fridays will be the most popular options.</p>
<p>Thursday: Although it breaks up the working week in a similar way, this seems a less satisfactory remote working day than Tuesday. That is because, having avoided the commute on Thursday, you will have to go through the process all over again on a Friday. There is something to be said for this option, however, as it means you can start thinking about the weekend on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Friday: Like Monday, this is too suspicious a choice. Colleagues will smile knowingly and use their fingers as inverted commas when you say you are “working from home” on Fridays. Managers will take to calling you at various moments in the day to listen out for tell-tale signs of the beach or golf course.</p>
<p>There is no need to risk experiencing this managerial suspicion. Slackers have long learned that Fridays tend to be more relaxed at the office; colleagues may disappear for long lunches (or early drinks) and no one will ask too many questions if you are not at your desk after 3pm. So if you genuinely want to bunk off work, go in on Fridays and sneak in your leisure time on a different day. And if you are a diligent employee who wants to maintain a reputation for hard work, don’t choose Friday for remote working.</p>
<p>Of course, many companies may allow two days of remote working, which leads to another ten possible combinations. To avoid suspicion, don’t pick Monday/Friday or Thursday/Friday as your remote combination. Tuesday and Thursday might be a good selection, as it means you will be at the office (and thus visible) every other day.</p>
<p>And then there is the possibility of flexible hours. Early risers may relish the chance to start the day at 8am, finish by 4pm and have the rest of the day to themselves. But in many companies the boss is up at the crack of dawn, so the early bird may be landed with all the work. Start at noon, and finish at 8pm, and you may find there is nobody around to bother you after 6pm, and you can safely have dinner and watch Netflix. The rules are changing and so is the potential to exploit them. To flourish in the era of remote working, employees will need the cunning of Machiavelli and the tactical brilliance of Napoleon.</p>

<p>来源：2021-06-19 TheEconomist UKedition</p>
<p>From cuisine to carmaking, the Japanese way is meticulous. Yet with just over a month to go, the Tokyo Olympics remain anything but. Thanks to covid-19, and Japan’s sluggish vaccinations, it is unclear whether the games, originally due to be held last summer, will let spectators in—if, that is, the event takes place at all. Organisers insist it will. This is nerve-jangling for those hoping to peak at the right moment: the athletes, of course, but also the games’ financial muscle, its corporate sponsors. Though no backers have pulled out, some are privately calling for another delay. Asahi Shimbun, the games’ official media partner, has called the decision by the International Olympic Committee (ioc) to plough on “self-righteous”. What was supposed to be a golden opportunity to burnish brands has turned into a reputational minefield.</p>
<p>Olympic commercialism has deep roots. Kodak advertised in the official results book of the inaugural modern games in 1896. Then, in 1984, the Los Angeles Olympics ushered in a new era. It was the first to be largely bankrolled by big business. Organisers bet that brands from McDonald’s to Buick would splash out for exclusivity in their product segments. And splash out they did: the la games turned a profit. Since then profits have been rare for host cities, which splurge billions on venues and transport links.</p>
<p>For corporate sponsors the financial wins are nebulous. Still, they keep coming back, so must feel it is worth it. They can flaunt brands, push new products to a global audience—3.2bn people tuned in to the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016—and be associated with a globally admired symbol, the Olympic rings. The Tokyo organisers touted all this plus, for domestic sponsors, a chance to partake in a celebration of Japan’s emergence from decades of economic stagnation, just as the 1964 games marked its post-war “coming-out party”, says Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist. Tokyo raised over $3bn from 47 mostly domestic “partners”—more than twice the previous Olympic record. It is also getting around $500m from the ioc’s 14 “top” sponsors: global firms like Coca-Cola, Visa and Airbnb that sign multi-games tie-ins.</p>
<p>Corporate involvement always carries risks for the firms. When people look back at Rio, they are just as likely to recall crime, white-elephant projects and the Zika virus as sporting glory. But the disintegration of a mega-event is something else entirely. There are few precedents in sport; the collapse of Allen Stanford’s annual cricket Super Series in 2009, when he was charged with running a Ponzi scheme, hardly compares (with all due respect to cricket fans). This time a last-minute cancellation, or a spike in covid-19 cases a few days in, cannot be ruled out. Parts of Japan remain under a state of emergency. Over half the population opposes the games going ahead.</p>
<p>That puts domestic partners, such as Japan Airlines and ntt, a telecoms firm, in a bind. What was sold to them as a once-in-a-generation opportunity now risks alienating consumers in their home market. They doubled down last year, signing contract extensions and adding a combined $200m to the pot. Some, fearing a summer pr disaster, are reportedly offering even bigger sums if the games are moved to October, when more people will have jabs and public disquiet may have abated. The top sponsors, whose contracts may span a few summer and winter games, can shrug off one dud Olympics. Regulars like Coke and Visa are already looking beyond Tokyo. The 2022 winter games will, pandemic permitting, kick off in just over seven months. Yet there, too, corporate backers face a problem: the choice of host, Beijing, has led to ever louder calls for a boycott over China’s human-rights record.</p>
<p>Such pleas are not new—they rang loud before the Beijing summer games of 2008. Firms have mostly shaken them off. They are more willing to withdraw endorsements from misbehaving individuals (think Lance Armstrong or Tiger Woods) than to desert tainted hosts and organisers, from China to fifa, football’s corruption-plagued governing body, because of the vast tv exposure they offer. That may not be so easy this time. Global outrage over China’s mistreatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority is mounting, as is pressure on companies to find “purpose”—which in practice often means taking a stand on hot-button issues.</p>
<p>In the run-up to Beijing, global brands will thus find themselves squeezed between calls to disengage and fear of retaliation from a huge market. Pulling back from one Olympics, let alone two, could shut them out for longer, as firms from China and elsewhere take their place. Undemocratic regimes are happy to splash out for sports-tournament hosting rights; Qatar is hosting the 2022 football World Cup. Local companies are waving money. Russia’s Gazprom is a sports-advertising giant. Chinese firms are spending heavily to boost their global image: Hisense, Alipay and Vivo are among the top ten sponsors of the European Championship in football that kicked off last week. Alibaba is unlikely to be the sole Chinese firm on the ioc’s top roster for long.</p>
<p>Champion prevaricators<br>Back in Tokyo, some sponsors have hired consultants to assess the possible impact on their brands of sticking with the programme or withdrawing. Marketing campaigns are “in disarray”, says one adviser. With no spectators, there will be no promotions at venues or corporate hospitality. Merchandise sales will be limp; mountains of Tokyo 2020-branded gear will gather dust. As for advertising, sponsors are unsure what the message should be, or whether to flaunt their ties to the Olympics. Just in case, many are not, instead telling athletes’ stories while emphasising unity, resilience and other admirable traits that imply an awareness of the pandemic. Some sponsors are working on dual campaigns, one more Olympic-themed than the other. For Western brands, the ideal competition would always take place in a world of happy, healthy democracies. But most aren’t above donning their face masks or holding their noses, if that is what it takes to stay in the race. </p>
