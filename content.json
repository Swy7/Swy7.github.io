Gilbert’s grief nonetheless propels him into the thick of life, and he starts paying heightened aesthetic attention to his surroundings. Oliveira films Gilbert and the city with puckish delight and graceful precision that capture the actor’s refined sensibility—and his poignant awareness that he may be seeing things for the last time. Yet, when Gilbert is offered the plum role of Buck Mulligan in an adaptation of “Ulysses” by an American director (John Malkovich), the performer must decide whether he’s ready to trade his new life of seeing for the chance to be seen again. Oliveira, a nvonagenarian when he made the film, conveys the hidden rapture of daily life—and the power of images to preserve it. In French and English.—R.B.

I had a twin cabin; though expensive, it did not have the thirty-seven-thousand-dollar ticket price of the Cabin Suite. And, happily, my conversations consisted of topics much more interesting than the “same anecdote, from the same retired fund manager, all the way across a continent.” Far from being loathsome fat cat financiers, many passengers had saved for years to take this trip of a lifetime, just as I did. They ran the gamut from two longtime friends from Australia to a retired oncologist and his seriously ill wife; a woman who worked on the 9/11 victim-compensation fund; and a young man and his mother, to whom he’d given the trip for her fiftieth birthday.
